# Crate-extraction execution roadmap

**Current baseline:** `466c2896` (`origin/main`, 2026-08-14)
**Parent planning PR:** [#193](https://github.com/Banon-Labs/er-effects-rs/pull/193)
**R1 scope:** publish the current ownership, function-partition, and caller ledger for every Rust file below `crates/er-effects-rs/src/experiments/`. This is a documentation/tooling checkpoint. It changes no runtime code and authorizes no extraction.

The earlier planning analyses remain historical evidence in PR #193. This document is the execution record for the current baseline; source functions and caller boundaries below supersede stale line-range plans.

## 1. Current measured state

| scope | files | lines |
|---|---:|---:|
| all `experiments/**` | 76 | 47,658 |
| excluding `startup_hooks/**` | 43 | 24,324 |
| `startup_hooks/**` plus `startup_hooks.rs` | 33 | 23,334 |
| lifecycle S10 split | 5 | 2,241 |
| own-load S11 split | 5 | 2,905 |
| save redirect | 3 | 2,501 |

The `scripts/check-crate-extraction-roadmap.py` gate checks the paths, line counts, and required caller edges below. A source file add/remove/line-count change must refresh this ledger in the same change (`--refresh` does the mechanical part).

### D4 partially accepted (2026-08-25): `er-diag-harness`

The three files that left `experiments/**` are `startup_hooks/diagnostics/{msb_parse_trace,loadlist_wait_trace,dlc_roots_trace}.rs`, into the new `crates/er-diag-harness` cdylib. They were the only rows on the D4 list that a second image could take: each is observe-and-forward, none exports an `oracle_*` field, and none reads or writes a product static.

The rest of D4 does **not** follow them, and the reason is measured rather than judged. `trace/**` (4,134 lines) cannot move: `install_continue_trace_hooks` runs on every normal product boot -- its gate is `trace_continue_enabled()`, which is `product_autoload_enabled()`, armed by default -- and `create_continue_trace_hook` is `er-title-flow`'s SOLE hook-install primitive for eight product hooks, wired in from `bootstrap.rs`. Inside those files, `map_mount_guard_flip_tick` and `blockres_phase2_hook` write game memory as corrective fixes, `cap_builder_hook` overrides the native LoadGame slot argument, and `cap_dialog_factory_hook` drives the own-stepper into STAGE2; seven of their statics are read by product code outside the family, and four feed `oracle_*` fields. `menu_diag/menu_observation.rs` is likewise blocked: `decode_thunk_hop` is on the live `er-title-flow` seam. `input_trace.rs` has no hooks of its own -- it borrows the XInput detour that `input_block.rs` installs for the save picker, and `input_block.rs:786` calls back into it -- so moving it would need that detour to become a `[[shared]]` hook-union anchor first.

### ProfileSummary extraction accepted (2026-08-26): `er-profile-summary-core`

`CS::ProfileSummary` -- the ten in-memory character records the game deserializes once at boot --
was one concept holding four files of this shim, one verb each: `continue_load/slot_resolution.rs`
had the live-record fingerprint, `loading_cover/loading_cover_save_slot.rs` had the summary pointer
and the serialized-save reader that fills a record,
`startup_hooks/quit_menu/save_swap_profile_table.rs` had the whole-table rebuild, and
`continue_load/picked_summary_refresh.rs` -- a whole new module born in the shim, and the file this
gate's ratchet was built to catch -- had the boot re-read that uses all three. All four moved to
`crates/er-profile-summary-core`; the record LAYOUT stays in `er_game_base::profile_summary`, whose
typed asserts pin the 1.16.2 ABI.

The remaining halves stayed with the surfaces that own them, and each one is a measured boundary
rather than a judgement call:

* the System>Quit preview's snapshot/backout bookkeeping and its renderer refresh stayed in
  `save_swap_profile_table.rs`: the two callers of the record transport want opposite things from a
  snapshot (a preview is reversible, a boot re-read is not a preview at all);
* `load_profile_slot_caches_from_bytes` stayed in
  `loading_cover/title_resources_stats_text.rs` and crossed back as a host-seam field: it fills the
  per-slot name / stats / saved-map / place-name caches the ProfileSelect ROWS read, which are a
  different surface from the records;
* `native_fullread_slot`, `direct_save_file_source_active` and
  `active_save_file_for_system_quit` stayed and crossed back the same way -- slot policy and save
  source are `continue_load/slot_resolution.rs` and `save_redirect`'s concepts, and taking them
  would have meant depending on `er-title-flow`, which is this crate's natural CONSUMER and would
  have closed a dependency cycle.

Measured effect on the ledger: 48,740 -> 47,658 lines, 77 -> 76 files.

## 2. R1 ownership rules

1. **Current owner means present implementation owner.** Every row states the actual owner at this baseline, not a hoped-for crate destination.
2. **A partition is a named function family or an entire file.** Future work must move the named family, not a stale line interval.
3. **`STAY` is an explicit disposition.** It means the product owns the current implementation until a named decision or later roadmap node changes that fact.
4. **`D1`, `D2`, `D4`, and `D5` are decisions, not destinations.** A decision-gated row remains product-owned until its decision is accepted.
5. **Caller boundaries are source paths, not inferred ownership.** The required edges are checked from current Rust source so a refactor cannot leave this ledger silently stale.

## 3. Completed in-place correctness splits

| completed slice | current files | exact current partition | direct caller boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| S10 lifecycle | `lifecycle/save_flow.rs` | `save_flow_tick` and its private save-flow state-machine helpers; future R20 implementation candidate | `lifecycle/task_tick.rs` calls `save_flow_tick` |
| S10 lifecycle | `lifecycle/task_tick.rs` | `tick_before_player_lookup`; product recurring-task scheduling stays | `lib_parts/dll_entry_parts/task_registration.rs` calls `tick_before_player_lookup` |
| S10 lifecycle | `lifecycle/title_visual_startup.rs` | `install_title_visual_startup_hooks`; product startup arming/order stays | `lib_parts/dll_entry_parts/bootstrap.rs` calls it |
| S10 lifecycle | `lifecycle/hook_installers.rs` | `install_profile_and_system_quit_hooks` and `install_boot_diagnostics_and_trace_hooks`; product install ordering stays | `lib_parts/dll_entry_parts/bootstrap.rs` calls both |
| S11 own-load | `own_load/loaders/load_drive.rs` | `own_load_drive`, `own_load_continue_fire`, and the job-slot/pump helpers; D5 candidate | `fallback_drives.rs`, `switch_reload.rs`, and `lifecycle/task_tick.rs` call the public functions |
| S11 own-load | `own_load/loaders/switch_reload.rs` | switch-reload reset/feed/FD4IO helpers; D5 candidate | `continue_load/slot_resolution.rs`, `system_quit_repro_guards.rs`, and `lib_parts/runtime_helpers.rs` call the public functions |
| S11 own-load | `own_load/drive.rs` | native-load hooks, world-resource hold, save-byte reader, and stream observer; D5 candidate | S10 task tick, S11 loaders, title resources, and System>Quit guards call the public functions |

S10 and S11 are complete in-place module splits. R1 does not reopen their correctness work or fold their function families back into their former flat files.

## 4. Critical current caller map

### 4.1 Save redirect

| function family | current implementation | direct external callers | R1 disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| bootstrap source decision | `enforce_save_override_or_abort`, `missing_save_selection_pending`, `complete_missing_save_selection_from_picker` in `save_redirect/path_hooks.rs` | `lib_parts/dll_entry_parts/bootstrap.rs`; boot picker, boot progress, task tick, and picker menu consumers | product owns source selection and arming; R32 re-baselines the existing `er-save-redirect` interface |
| source identity and normalization | `active_steam_id64`, `normalize_save_bytes_to_active_steam_id`, `configured_or_default_save_file`, `active_save_file_for_system_quit` | continue-load, own-load, save-swap, and System>Quit handlers | implementation is a R32/R33 candidate; callers remain product adapters until an interface passes the deletion/depth test |
| rejection terminal state | `own_load_save_rejection_terminal`, fingerprint, repeated-rejection, record, signature, and probe helpers | own-load drive/loaders and title resource reader | current product-owned cross-feature guard; R32 records whether it belongs with redirect implementation or remains product policy |
| file-hook installation | `install_save_file_core_hooks`, `save_file_core_hooks_live`, and `install_save_redirect_hooks` in `save_redirect/file_ops.rs` | `path_hooks.rs` installs redirect hooks; boot picker reads core-hook liveness | existing `er-save-redirect` installation/queue owner remains the only future destination; R1 adds no host layer |

### 4.2 ProfileSelect editor runtime (`profile_05_010_editor_runtime.rs`)

| child node | exact function family | direct caller boundary | current owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| R12B1 transport | `editor_dir`, `write_status`, `write_status_text`, `heartbeat_status`, `read_command`, `defer_path_editor_command`, `status_for`, and `profile_editor_necromancy_tick` | task registration calls `profile_editor_necromancy_tick` | product scheduling; child node selects a transport owner without moving arming |
| R12B2 field application | `profile_editor_field_font_height`, `remember_profile_editor_field_target`, `forget_profile_editor_field_targets`, `cached_profile_editor_field_utf16`, `live_player_name_utf16`, `utf16_status_preview`, `profile_editor_runtime_tick`, `apply_profile_editor_command`, `apply_profile_editor_field_probe`, and `apply_profile_editor_one_field` | save-picker menu reads font height; title resource hooks cache and apply fields; quit-menu teardown forgets fields | product implementation pending R12B2 interface proof |
| R12B3 drive/chrome geometry | `command_targets_drive_row`, chrome/drive/path probe application, current-path and drive cursor transforms, and `apply_drive_row_native_cursor` | title resource hook calls `apply_drive_row_native_cursor` | product implementation pending R12B3 dependency proof |
| R12B4 path-window/caret | `apply_path_editor_window_position`, `reset_path_editor_caret_latch`, `apply_path_editor_caret_to_end`, `place_path_editor_caret_at_end`, and `set_text_field_caret_to_end` | profile-row hook places the window; path editor resets the caret latch | product implementation pending R12B4 lifecycle proof |
| R12B5 Scaleform primitives | proxy transform/value resolution, child resolution/destruction, setter guard, and position/scale setters | used only through the R12B2-R12B4 families | owner selected by D2; product keeps arming |

### 4.3 Native path editor (`save_picker_path_editor.rs`)

| child node | exact function family | direct caller boundary | current owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| R13B1 path model | `PathEditorOutcome`, `path_editor_outcome`, `path_editor_owns_terminal_job`, and `normalize_native_path_editor_text` | terminal hook and menu-pump adapter use the model | product implementation pending R13B1 save-identity proof |
| R13B2 terminal hooks | `software_keyboard_recipe`, `install_software_keyboard_result_hooks`, `software_keyboard_result_state`, `software_keyboard_text`, and the result/terminal callback hooks | used by native submission and terminal capture only | product implementation pending R13B2 runtime-hook proof |
| R13B3 native job submission | `SoftwareKeyboardConfig`, `SoftwareKeyboardRecipe`, `submit_path_editor`, and `apply_path_editor_outcome` | R13B4 menu-pump adapter submits and consumes the result | product implementation pending R13B3 native-queue proof |
| R13B4 lifecycle adapter | `save_picker_path_editor_active`, `path_editor_window_is_live`, `save_picker_note_path_editor_window_state`, `save_picker_reset_path_editor_state`, `save_picker_request_path_editor`, and `save_picker_menu_pump_path_editor` | save-picker menu requests/resets/checks activity; profile rows report window state and pump it | product scheduling stays; child node selects the feature implementation owner |

## 5. Execution sequence after R1

| ID | deliverable | gate | depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| R2 | delete verified startup remainder and duplicate tests | source caller proof, equivalence proof, fingerprint | R1 |
| R4-R5 | finish loading-bar ownership then split boot progress by owner | loading-bar tests, static gate, file-size gate | R0a |
| R6A-R6D | give each trace family explicit imports | static gate and fingerprint | R0 |
| R7-R11 | move whole startup families only after their caller map remains current | per-family static and runtime gates | R1 |
| R12A-R13A | approve interfaces for the editor families above | reviewed partition and dependency proof | R1, R14, R0a |
| R14-R20 | repair save identity, move parsing/picker/quit families, then move lifecycle save-flow implementation | save corpus equality and feature runtime proof | R1, R0a |
| R32-R37 | move save redirect path/detour implementation only through the existing owner | interface depth review, host tests, redirected-save proof | R1 |
| D1/D2/D4/D5 | accept or reject optional crate extractions from evidence | interface and dependency review | affected current ledger rows |

### R24A decision -- descriptor guard collapsed into R8

Reject a duplicate descriptor-guard extraction. Merged PR #272 already moved the descriptor-advance detour, byte-verified RVA/offset identities, and trampoline state into `er-scaleform-hooks`; its fresh-title proof recorded `oracle_scaleform_desc_guard_installed = 1`. The remaining `scaleform_descriptor_guard.rs` root wrapper is product policy: it retains attach-time ordering and turns the hook crate's installation result into product diagnostic logging. Moving that wrapper would be a different startup-policy change, not R24A's native mechanism move. The remaining R24 resource/message families stay independently executable.

## Appendix B -- R32 save-redirect ownership rebaseline

R32 audits every remaining root save-redirect function after the pure planner, source validation, Win32 detour installation, original-function slots, and thread-local reentry guards moved to `er-save-redirect`. Every root function is **STAY**: it either applies product configuration, owns a game/UI/Steam boundary, mutates the product's private stage tree, publishes product telemetry, or is a root DLL detour callback. The crate's existing `SaveDetourDepth` and `SaveNtCreateDetourGuard` tests remain the depth/deletion invariant: native disk I/O is refused while either detour is active, the ntdll leg does not inflate healthy Win32 depth, and nested entries are pass-throughs rather than recursive work.

| Root region | Disposition | Exact functions |
|---|---|---|
| `save_redirect/path_hooks.rs:106-1281` | **STAY** -- product config, game/Steam identity, picker state, and product telemetry | `save_override_telemetry_only`, `save_trace_enabled`, `observe_steam_id64_from_save_path`, `active_steam_id64`, `log_save_steam_id_locations`, `normalize_save_bytes_to_active_steam_id`, `save_file_writeback_allowed`, `normalize_env_save_file_to_known_steam_id`, `normalize_env_save_file_to_active_steam_id_once`, `own_load_save_rejection_terminal`, `own_load_save_rejection_fingerprint`, `own_load_save_repeated_identical_rejections`, `record_own_load_save_rejection`, `own_load_save_rejection_signature`, `own_load_save_rejection_probe`, `write_save_redirect_telemetry`, `save_path_kind_label`, `record_save_like_createfile_path_kind`, `record_save_like_query_path_kind`, `direct_stage_no_steamid_kind_label`, `direct_stage_file_status`, `set_missing_save_dialog_state`, `missing_save_selection_pending`, `direct_save_file_source_active`, `env_save_file_path`, `validated_save_file_path`, `picker_status_for_save_source_rejection`, `validated_default_save_file`, `validated_configured_save_file`, `configured_active_steam_id64_env`, `steam_api_active_steam_id64`, `configured_active_steam_id64`, `save_redirect_native_source_dir`, `default_save_root`, `seamless_save_container_name`, `resident_module_path`, `ersc_settings_path`, `active_default_save_file_name`, `staged_save_container_names`, `active_default_save_file_names`, `default_save_with_character`, `default_save_file_for_steam_id64`, `default_save_file_candidates`, `active_default_save_file`, `configured_or_default_save_file`, `direct_mode_native_active_save_file`, `active_save_file_for_system_quit`, `save_redirect_source_for_validated_file`, `save_override_redirect_source`, `activate_save_redirect_source`, `enforce_save_override_or_abort`, `save_picker_seamless_mode_after_settle`, `complete_missing_save_selection_from_picker`, `wait_for_missing_save_dialog_if_pending` |
| `save_redirect/path_hooks.rs:1296-1596` | **STAY** -- private-stage filesystem lifecycle | `wide_len`, `ensure_direct_stage_for_requested_path`, `make_file_writable`, `remove_file_for_overwrite`, `read_normalized_save_for_stage`, `write_staged_save`, `ensure_direct_stage_for_steam_id`, `remove_stale_staged_saves`, `save_redirect_path` |
| `save_redirect/path_hooks.rs:1614-1894` | **STAY** -- root Win32 detour callbacks | `save_redirect_createfilew_hook`, `save_redirect_copyfilew_hook`, `save_path_api_redirect`, `save_redirect_getattrw_hook`, `save_redirect_getattrexw_hook`, `save_redirect_findfirstw_hook` |
| `save_redirect/path_hooks.rs:1929-1991` | **STAY** -- product integration tests | `vanilla_loads_only_sl2_and_never_a_seamless_co2`, `the_write_target_is_the_preferred_load_candidate`, `staging_covers_every_container_the_active_mode_can_ask_for`, `normalize_one_shot_bails_before_resolving_a_path_inside_a_detour` |
| `save_redirect/file_ops.rs:22-232` | **STAY** -- root Win32/ntdll detour callbacks and logging | `save_redirect_shgetfolderpathw_hook`, `save_ntcreatefile_diag_hook`, `save_redirect_getdiskfreew_hook`, `save_redirect_ntqueryvolinfo_hook` |
| `save_redirect/file_ops.rs:271-324` | **STAY** -- product loader resolution and hook lifecycle | `running_under_wine`, `module_proc`, `kernel32_proc`, `install_save_file_core_hooks`, `save_file_core_hooks_live`, `install_save_redirect_hooks` |

- Every row names its present product partition and next work node; no row derives ownership from a stale line range.
- Sections 3 and 4 pin the S10/S11, save-redirect, ProfileSelect editor, and native path-editor function/caller boundaries that later work must preserve or deliberately update.
- `scripts/check-crate-extraction-roadmap.py --selftest` and the live checker enforce the mechanical inventory and the critical caller map.
