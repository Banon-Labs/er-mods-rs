# er-effects-rs

`er-effects-rs` is an Elden Ring runtime DLL written in Rust. Its current product
focus is **quick load**: get from process start to an in-world character without
manual menu input, while replacing the dead early boot gap with native progress
feedback and optional personalized visuals.

The long-term shape is broader than quick load. This repo is also the integration
point for several runtime features that can be combined when needed: local-only
SpEffect triggers, save-source redirection, boot/loading-screen presentation,
profile portrait rendering, loading-screen character portrait experiments, and
Cheat Engine helper tables.

## Current product focus: quick load

The supported quick-load path is a single `er_effects_rs.dll` loaded through
[me3](https://github.com/garyttierney/me3) as a native DLL. LazyLoader/dinput8
chainloading has been removed from the release path.

Quick load currently aims to:

- skip the current-version splash/intro path;
- advance the press-any-button/title-menu gates without simulated host input;
- force offline-safe title flow where needed;
- select/load the requested save slot;
- block user/foreign input during the automated boot window;
- release input once the world is reached;
- provide RAM/telemetry oracles for proof instead of relying on screenshots;
- draw boot progress before the game's native loading screen appears.

Validated product proof in this branch includes quick-load/runtime smokes where
the boot view drew hundreds of frames, handed off to the native loading/portrait
path, exited on `world_stable`, produced `oracle_msgbox_total_builds=0`, and kept
`simulated_button_presses_total=0`. The local Steam-screenshot background path is
optional and falls back cleanly when no real local Elden Ring screenshot exists.

## Feature map

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Quick load / zero-input autoload | Primary focus | me3-native DLL, native title/menu gates, no host button simulation. |
| Boot progress view | Product path | Present-hook D3D12 overlay draws a small milestone loading bar from RAM semaphores before native loading UI exists. |
| Steam screenshot boot background | Optional branch feature | DLL-only local Steam screenshot discovery/decoding; optional predecoded override for dev/power users. No launch-time network. |
| Native loading-screen portrait | Experimental/product-adjacent | Character portrait rendering/composite exists; continuous per-frame refresh still has known GX subcontext contention. |
| SpEffect trigger calls | Existing base feature | Named SpEffect calls from `data/effects.json`, default local-only networking semantics. |
| Save-source redirect/default-save fallback | Product support | Can load explicit `.sl2`/`.co2` sources or fall back to active Steam user's default save path. |
| System/Quit save-profile UX | Experimental helper | Runtime support for selecting replacement save profiles during menu flows. |
| Cheat Engine helper tables | Utility | Tables live under `scripts/cheat-engine/`, including CJK font override helpers. |
| Param tooling | Host tooling | `er-param-inspect` validates/inspects regulation params through Smithbox/SoulsFormats. |

## Quick start: stage the quick-load release

Build and stage the release payload:

<!-- md-test: bash-n -->
```bash
scripts/stage-autoload-release.sh --output target/autoload-release
```

The staged folder contains:

- `er_effects_rs.dll`
- `er-effects.me3`
- `er-effects-autoload.txt.example`
- `er-effects-native-continue.txt.example`
- `er-effects-pab-advance.txt.example`
- `er-effects-splash-skip.txt.example`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`

Install/use:

1. Keep the staged folder together. `er-effects.me3` references the DLL relative
   to itself, so the folder is relocatable.
2. Copy the desired `er-effects-*.txt.example` files next to `eldenring.exe` and
   remove `.example`.
3. Edit `er-effects-autoload.txt` if you need a slot other than `slot=0`.
4. Launch with me3:

<!-- md-test: bash-run -->
```bash
me3 launch -g eldenring -p /path/to/er-effects.me3
```

Do not launch Elden Ring through the protected/EAC launcher for agent/runtime
work. The release profile is designed for the direct/offline me3 native-DLL path.

## User-friendly helper package without DLLs or saves

To create a redistributable helper package that contains only docs/templates and a
launcher wrapper -- **not** `er_effects_rs.dll`, `.sl2`/`.co2` saves, or other DLLs
-- run:

<!-- md-test: bash-n -->
```bash
scripts/build-user-release-package.py --clean
```

The generated zip under `target/deliverables/` includes `run-er-effects-release.sh`,
`quicksave.me3.template`, `er-effects.toml.example`, and audit manifests. The
helper requires the user to pass their locally-built DLL path at launch time and
never copies a save file into the package.

## Optional: Steam screenshot boot background

The DLL can draw a personal Steam screenshot behind the pre-native boot loading
bar. The production path is DLL-only:

- the DLL enumerates local Steam `userdata/*/760/remote/1245620/screenshots`
  directories and chooses the newest `.jpg`/`.png` it can decode;
- no Steam account ID is hard-coded;
- the DLL never scrapes Steam Community;
- the DLL never downloads during launch;
- missing/bad screenshots fall back to the normal black boot progress view.

The boot view aspect-covers the screenshot, dims it, and draws a soft faded
shadow behind the progress bar so the bar remains readable without a hard panel.

Users can override the automatic local-Steam screenshot selection in the
game-directory `er-effects.toml`:

<!-- md-test: parse-toml -->
```toml
boot_background_image = "C:/path/to/background.jpg"
# Linux absolute paths are accepted under Proton/Wine and are translated to Z:\\...
# boot_background_image = "/home/you/Pictures/my-load-screen.png"
# Relative paths resolve next to er-effects.toml in the game directory:
# boot_background_image = "backgrounds/my-load-screen.png"

# Default: true. Set false to use the custom image only during the pre-native
# boot gap, then let the game's normal MENU_Load_* artwork own the native
# loading screen.
persist_boot_background_to_loading_screen = true
```

Accepted image aliases are `background_image`, `boot.background_image`,
`boot.background`, and `background.image`. The image must be a local `.jpg`,
`.jpeg`, or `.png`; it is decoded in-process by the DLL via Windows Imaging
Component. By default, the selected boot background also replaces the game's
native `MENU_Load_*` GFX background during the loading screen; opt out with
`persist_boot_background_to_loading_screen = false`.

A lower-level predecoded override remains available for development/power users:

```text
<game-dir>/er-effects-boot-background.rgba
```

That file uses a tiny `ERBGRA01` header plus width/height and RGBA8 pixels.
`scripts/cache-steam-screenshot-background.py` can write it, but that script is
**developer-only tooling** and is not part of the shipped production pipeline.

## Runtime configuration files

Most quick-load toggles are simple `.txt` files placed next to `eldenring.exe`.
`er-effects.toml` is different: it is loaded from the game directory, next to
`eldenring.exe`. Environment variables with matching names are also used by
probes and smoke scripts.

Common quick-load files/config:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `er-effects-autoload.txt` | Selects the requested quick-load slot, e.g. `slot=0`. |
| `er-effects-native-continue.txt` | Enables the supported native Continue path. |
| `er-effects-pab-advance.txt` | Enables zero-input press-any-button/menu-open advance. |
| `er-effects-splash-skip.txt` | Enables built-in splash skip when not already implied by quick load. |
| `er-effects.toml` | Game-directory config file; can provide `save_file`, `build_url`, `boot_background_image`, and `persist_boot_background_to_loading_screen`. |
| `er-effects-boot-background.rgba` | Game-directory developer/power-user predecoded screenshot override; not required for production local Steam screenshot discovery. |

Important experimental/probe files exist too (`er-effects-force-profile-render.txt`,
`er-effects-portrait-render-drive.txt`, etc.). Those are for controlled runtime probes
and are not the minimal quick-load release surface. Cursor/head tracking for the
loading portrait is intentionally not a supported feature.

## Importing a build from a planner link

The System > Quit tab's **Load Build from URL** row rebuilds the character you are
currently playing from an [`er-build-planner`](https://er-build-planner.pages.dev/)
share link: items granted, gear worn, spells memorised within the real memory-slot
count, quickbar/pouch/physick filled, level and attributes matched, class and great
rune set. It runs where you stand -- it does not return to the title and does not
touch your save container -- and you can press it as often as you like.

The link comes from `build_url` in the game-directory `er-effects.toml`:

<!-- md-test: parse-toml -->
```toml
build_url = 'https://er-build-planner.pages.dev/?b=af97a9da874151'
```

Only the `?b=<id>` form works. The self-contained `?i=` form carries the whole build
in the URL and is not fetched. With no `build_url` set, the row does nothing and says
so in `er-effects-autoload-debug.log`.

Every change the import makes is confirmed by reading game memory back afterwards,
never by a call having returned, and the counts it reports are those read-backs. The
detail lands in `er-build-import-core.log` beside the game executable; the row's own
outcome, including a fetch that failed after the press, lands in
`er-effects-autoload-debug.log`.

## Save-source behavior

The DLL resolves its autoload source once, at attach, in this order:

1. `save_file` from the DLL-adjacent sidecar `<dll-name>.toml` (per-run overlay,
   see below), else `save_file` in the game-directory `er-effects.toml`.
2. Otherwise, the active Steam user's valid default container:
   `%APPDATA%/EldenRing/<SteamID64>/ER0000.sl2` for vanilla, or the configured
   Seamless container when Seamless is active.
3. If neither source has a readable character, the DLL opens the missing-save
   picker and refuses world entry until the user selects a valid save.

An explicit source is read-only: the DLL stages it into a private native save
root, so it never writes back to the selected file. Configure an explicit save
and character slot in `er-effects.toml`:

<!-- md-test: parse-toml -->
```toml
save_file = "C:/path/to/ER0000.sl2"
slot = 1
```

With no `slot` set, the full-read path selects slot `0`. A picker-selected
character overrides it. A configured slot names only a target inside a resolved
source; it is not proof that the default save exists, that its slot is occupied,
or that it was loaded in a prior run.

There is no environment-variable route. `ER_EFFECTS_SAVE_FILE` and
`ER_EFFECTS_AUTOLOAD_SLOT` were **removed**, not deprecated: they were a second
way to name the same thing, sitting in front of the config file, and
`save_redirect/path_hooks.rs` treated both as one class ("an explicit loose save
source"). The two could disagree while the debug log named only one of them, and
environment state is invisible to anyone reading the config afterwards, so a run
could not be reconstructed from what it left on disk.

### Per-run overlay (`<dll-name>.toml`)

A launcher staging one build for one run needs to name that run's save without
writing the game directory -- which is shared, hand-edited, and outlives every
run. So the DLL also reads a sidecar beside the loaded module: `er_effects_rs.dll`
loads `er_effects_rs.toml` from the same directory.

It is an **overlay, not a replacement**. Only the keys it sets are overridden;
`os_native_save_picker`, `preferred_save_picker_dir` and `boot_background_image`
in your game-directory config are left exactly as you set them. Every override is
named in `er-effects-autoload-debug.log`, alongside which file each value came
from -- with two files feeding one config, a run that cannot say where a value
came from is not diagnosable.

An overlay can set a key but not unset one, so `save_file_default = true` clears
any inherited `save_file` and selects the active Steam user's own container.

`scripts/er-run-branch.py` writes this sidecar automatically. The distinct
filename matters: stale `er-effects.toml` files are strewn through `target/` and
worktree build dirs, and reusing that name would silently arm them.

There is **no** `require_save_picker` setting. `os_native_save_picker = true`
only chooses the OS dialog instead of the in-game browser *after* the picker
has already been triggered; it does not force a picker. Do not point `save_file`
at an invalid path to force one. A deliberate `require_save_picker` config key
is the missing product feature.

Before an autoload launch, read `er-effects.toml` and the prior DLL log's
`runtime-config` / `save-override` lines. They identify the configured slot and
whether the resolved source was `DEFAULT-USER-SAVE`, an explicit staged file, or
a missing-save picker. `.sl2` and Seamless `.co2` paths are compatibility
targets; this repo does **not** bundle Seamless Co-op's `ersc.dll`.

## Build and validation

This repo expects to live next to a `fromsoftware-rs` checkout because the root
crate uses path dependencies from `../fromsoftware-rs`.

Build the Windows DLL from Linux:

<!-- md-test: bash-n -->
```bash
cargo xwin build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

Output:

```text
target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/er_effects_rs.dll
```

Fast checks:

<!-- md-test: bash-n -->
```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo xwin check --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

Full repo gate:

<!-- md-test: bash-n -->
```bash
bash scripts/check.sh
```

Host-buildable tooling crates can be checked without the game DLL:

<!-- md-test: bash-n -->
```bash
cargo test -p er-soulsformats -p er-param-inspect
cargo check -p er-soulsformats -p er-param-inspect
```

## Runtime smoke tests

Runtime-affecting changes need a live smoke. The common quick-load/portrait smoke
entrypoint is:

<!-- md-test: bash-n -->
```bash
bash scripts/run-product-continue-direct-probe.sh
```

The smoke expects Steam to be running, stages an isolated save/artifact directory,
launches the approved direct/offline path, and tears down under the repository's
runtime cap. Important proof comes from structured telemetry such as:

- `reason=world_stable`
- `oracle_msgbox_total_builds=0`
- `simulated_button_presses_total=0`
- `oracle_boot_view_draw_hits`
- `oracle_overlay_draw_hits`
- `oracle_char_name` / character-level fields

Screenshots may be captured for human review, but screenshots are diagnostic
artifacts, not the run-stopping oracle.

## SpEffect trigger system

The original feature remains: named SpEffect calls are embedded from
`data/effects.json` and can be applied by runtime trigger logic. They start
inactive by default.

In-game controls:

The selector bar is **open** when all three hold: the bar is shown
(`overlay_visible_on_start`, or toggled back with Alt+Numpad0), it is
**expanded** rather than minimized to its `[+]` button, and a character is
loaded. The bar ships minimized -- click its `[+]` button to expand it.

Keys that move the on-screen cursor need the bar open:

- Left/Right: switch the active effect catalog.
- Up/Down: step through the selected catalog's validated IDs and apply the selected effect.
- Numpad +/-: add or remove the highlighted effect from the always-on stack.

Keys that are deliberate chords or your own bindings work whether the bar is
open or not, because firing an effect while you play is what the DLL is for:

- Alt+': toggle the currently selected effect off/on.
- Alt+Numpad0 (also Alt+0, Alt+Insert): show/hide the selector bar -- the way back to a hidden one.
- Anything you bind in `.er-net-effects-hotkeys.json`.

Only the four arrow keys are ever **taken** from the game, and only while the bar
is open: they are blanked out of the DirectInput keyboard state and swallowed by
the low-level keyboard hook so a cursor move is not also a quick-item switch.
Every other key the selector reads is passed straight through, and with the bar
closed nothing is taken at all -- including at the title screen and on every
loading screen, where the arrow keys are how you navigate.
`er-net-effects-telemetry.json` reports `effect_selector_open` (the gate itself,
which is NOT `effect_selector_visible`), `effect_keys_ignored_while_closed`, and
`effect_input_suppressed_arrow_keys`.

Runtime SpEffect application is gated to the loaded character state: the local player must exist before the DLL calls `apply_speffect`, but standing idle is allowed. Selector/file changes before the player exists may arm the selected effect; once the player is live, direct trigger hotkeys and selected effects apply immediately.

Persisted selector files next to `eldenring.exe`:

- `.effect-catalog-setting.txt`: selected catalog file name.
- `.effect-setting.txt`: selected SpEffect ID. Editing this file while the game is running applies the matching in-catalog effect ID live, moves the catalog cursor to the first catalog containing that ID, and persists effects as ON. If no user catalog contains the ID, the DLL records the ID but has no catalog entry to apply.
- `.effect-enabled-setting.txt`: persistent selector ON/OFF state (`on` or `off`). If it is `on`, the selected persisted effect is re-armed on DLL startup and applied once the local player is live.
- `.effect-hotkeys.json`: user-editable hotkey triggers. If missing, the DLL creates this default file:

<!-- md-test: skip illustrative JSON config example -->
```json
{
  "hotkeys": [
    {
      "name": "deathblight self test",
      "key": "numpad_multiply",
      "effect_id": 8355,
      "count": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

Supported key names include `numpad_multiply`, `numpad_add`, `numpad_subtract`, `numpad_divide`, `numpad_decimal`, `numpad0`..`numpad9`, arrow keys, and optional `alt+` prefixes. `count` is clamped to `1..=200`. Trigger hotkeys apply the configured SpEffect directly to the local player `count` times without removing other effects, and the file is reloaded while the game is running.

User catalogs:

The DLL starts with zero effect selector catalogs. User-provided game-directory catalogs can be placed in `effect-catalogs/*.json` next to `eldenring.exe`; each file is a plain JSON array of SpEffect IDs, with the file name acting as the catalog identity, for example `my-effects.json`. The DLL watches this folder while the game is running and reloads catalogs when JSON files are created/changed/removed.

Master catalog:

`effect-master-catalog.json` can be placed next to `eldenring.exe` when rich SpEffect metadata is available. It is keyed by `SpEffectParam` ID and records names, VFX IDs, derived tags, and meaningful non-default fields such as AI perception, HP/FP/stamina, movement/timing, damage, defense, and lifetime fields. When this file is present, selector/user catalog IDs are validated against it and the HUD uses its names. When it is absent, user catalog IDs still load with generic `SpEffect <id>` names. Selector/user catalogs should reference this file by ID instead of copying field metadata.

Regenerate the master catalog from a local regulation file:

<!-- md-test: bash-n -->
```bash
scripts/generate-effect-master-catalog.py --regulation "$REGULATION_BIN"
```

Validate the list against a regulation file:

<!-- md-test: bash-n -->
```bash
cargo run -p er-param-inspect -- validate "$REGULATION_BIN"
```

Inspect rows:

<!-- md-test: bash-n -->
```bash
cargo run -p er-param-inspect -- rows "$REGULATION_BIN" SpEffectParam 4330 20018100 20018101
```

## Network sync semantics

Each SpEffect call takes a "don't sync" flag. The overlay/control surface exposes
that as `Sync effect calls over the network`:

- **Off (default):** effects are applied with `dont_sync = true`; local-only and
  safer for offline/local testing.
- **On:** effects are applied with `dont_sync = false`, matching the Cheat Engine
  `addNetworked(..., id, 0)` pattern; peers may observe the application.

Leave sync off unless you specifically need peer-visible effect calls in a
controlled environment. Non-standard online behavior can be detectable and may
carry ban risk.

## Param tooling: Smithbox bridge

`er-soulsformats` and `er-param-inspect` read `regulation.bin` params by building
and running a small .NET bridge against Smithbox's `Andre.Formats` /
SoulsFormats libraries.

Supported Smithbox layouts:

- source checkout containing `src/Andre/Andre.Formats/Andre.Formats.csproj`;
- binary release/install containing `Andre.Formats.dll` or
  `Andre.SoulsFormats.dll`.

Discovery order uses `SMITHBOX_SOURCE_DIR` first, then `SMITHBOX_BINARY_DIR`,
then common sibling/local paths. `SMITHBOX_BINARY_DIR` points at a binary
Smithbox install directory containing `Andre.Formats.dll` and
`Andre.SoulsFormats.dll`; it is also passed to the generated bridge so .NET can
resolve Smithbox's transitive assemblies from that install directory at runtime.
The generated bridge lives under `target/soulsformats-bridge/`.

## Cheat Engine tables

Cheat Engine tables and helpers live in `scripts/cheat-engine/`.

Current table:

- `scripts/cheat-engine/bundled_cjk_font_override.CT` -- redirects the game's
  Scaleform menu font registration to bundled Simplified/Traditional Chinese
  font assets for Seamless/offline users.

## Architecture notes

High-level runtime pieces:

- `crates/er-effects-rs/src/lib.rs` / `crates/er-effects-rs/src/lib_parts/` -- DLL entry, bootstrapping, hooks, and runtime
  task registration.
- `crates/er-effects-rs/src/experiments/gpu_readback/boot_progress.rs` -- D3D12 boot progress view
  and optional cached screenshot background.
- `crates/er-effects-rs/src/experiments/present_overlay.rs` -- swapchain Present hook and backbuffer
  overlay path.
- `crates/er-effects-rs/src/experiments/save_redirect/` -- save path/source redirection and active
  SteamID/default-save support.
- `crates/er-effects-rs/src/experiments/own_stepper/` and `crates/er-effects-rs/src/experiments/own_load/` -- native
  quick-load/own-load research and product mechanisms.
- `crates/erpx-rs` -- debug portrait dump container and host PNG decoder.
- `crates/er-gfx`, `crates/er-tpf`, `crates/er-save-loader` -- host/DLL support
  crates for UI assets, texture payloads, and save data.

The current direction is to keep the runtime product as one composable DLL:
quick-load first, but able to export or combine the other runtime surfaces when a
profile or probe needs them.
