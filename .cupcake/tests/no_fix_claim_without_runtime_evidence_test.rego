# OPA unit tests for no_fix_claim_without_runtime_evidence: the Stop-event halt on a closing message
# that calls a change to game-loaded code a fix with no run behind it.
#
# Run with:
#   opa test .cupcake/system/commands.rego \
#     .cupcake/policies/claude/no_fix_claim_without_runtime_evidence.rego \
#     .cupcake/tests/no_fix_claim_without_runtime_evidence_test.rego
#
# These cases exercise the conjunction, which is what lives in the policy. The prose classification
# -- which sentences count as a fix claim at all, and which paths count as game-loaded code -- lives
# in scripts/cupcake_fix_claim.py and is proven by scripts/test-fix-claim-classifier.py, because a
# Rego test cannot see a regex in a shell signal. Both halves are needed: a policy green on
# hand-typed facts says nothing about whether a real transcript ever produces them, and that is the
# exact way every Stop guard in this repo stayed inert for 36 days.

# Where the miss actually was, measured against that transcript rather than reasoned about: the
# conjunction below was already correct and the claim was already detected. The facts line the signal
# produced read `evidence=1`, because the turn's last tool call was a `Monitor` armed on
# `tail -F er-quickload-autoload-debug.log` -- a filename in a tool input, on a log the just-started
# process had not written to. The allowlist in scripts/cupcake_fix_claim.py matched the name and
# called a subscription a read. So the fix is in the classifier, and these cases pin what the policy
# must do once the classifier stops lying to it. The claim strings are verbatim from the transcript,
# after the scrub that drops backticked spans.
