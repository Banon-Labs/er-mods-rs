# OPA unit tests for no_unexecuted_promise (the Stop-event halt on a turn that ended with a
# first-person promise nothing is going to keep).
# Run with:
#   opa test .cupcake/system/commands.rego \
#     .cupcake/policies/claude/no_unexecuted_promise.rego \
#     .cupcake/tests/no_unexecuted_promise_test.rego
#
# These pin the POLICY half: signal tag -> halt, and the correction text. The four false-positive
# carve-outs (contingent on the user, directive to the user, executed in-turn, covered by a live
# background task) are decided in the SIGNAL, and are pinned by scripts/test-unexecuted-promise-signal.py
# against crafted transcripts -- an empty signal here stands for every one of them.
