# The split of duty, same as the sibling guards. This file pins the RULE: which combination of facts
# halts a turn and what the correction says. The prose classification that produces those facts --
# which sentences restate a user-owned rule, and which are exempt -- lives in the SIGNAL and is
# pinned by `scripts/cupcake_user_own_rule.py --selftest` against the verbatim failure.
