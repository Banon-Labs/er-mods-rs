# OPA unit tests for no_narrated_action: the Stop-event halt on a closing message that ends by
# narrating the action instead of by carrying its outcome.
#
# Run with:
#   opa test .cupcake/system/commands.rego \
#     .cupcake/policies/claude/no_narrated_action.rego \
#     .cupcake/tests/no_narrated_action_test.rego
#
# These cases exercise the conjunction, which is what lives in the policy. The prose classification
# -- which sentences count as a narration at all -- lives in scripts/cupcake_narrated_action.py and
# is proven against the verbatim shapes by scripts/test-narrated-action-classifier.py, because a
# Rego test cannot see a regex in a shell signal. Both halves are needed: a policy green on
# hand-typed facts says nothing about whether a real transcript ever produces them.
