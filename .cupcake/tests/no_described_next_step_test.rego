# The split of duty, same as the sibling guards. This file pins the RULE: which combination of facts
# halts a turn and what the correction says. The prose classification that produces those facts --
# which sentences count as naming a next step, and which are exempt -- lives in the SIGNAL and is
# pinned by scripts/test-described-next-step-signal.py against the verbatim failure. Between the two
# suites the corpus is covered end to end: text in, facts out, halt or no halt.
#
# The four cases the user asked for are asserted in BOTH layers on purpose, because they are the
# intent of the whole guard and a reader should be able to find them in either file:
#   * the verbatim closing message of 2026-09-08  -> HALT;
#   * a turn that describes a next step and starts it in the same turn -> allow;
#   * a turn waiting on the user  -> allow;
#   * a turn reporting a genuine blocker -> allow.
