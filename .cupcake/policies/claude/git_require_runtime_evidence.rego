# This policy fires, and `scripts/check-runtime-evidence.sh` is the second enforcement point.
#
# It was inert for its first hours, and the header here said so at length and blamed
# `input.signals`, because a literal probe stopped firing the moment any rule read a signal. That
# diagnosis was wrong. The cause was `sprintf` in the deny reason: Cupcake's optimised WASM runtime
# does not implement it, so the builtin returns undefined and every rule whose body reaches one
# silently never fires while `cupcake eval` reports ALLOW and exits 0. The probe "stopped firing on
# `input.signals`" only because the signal-reading versions were the ones that also interpolated a
# note. Replacing it with `concat` made the policy deny on the first try.
#
# This repo already had a gate that names the whole class -- `scripts/check-cupcake-wasm-builtins.py`
# verifies 25 builtins against the live WASM runtime and prints the offending file. It was never run
# against this file, because `scripts/check.sh` was piped into `tail` once (which discards the
# verdict) and killed by a 120-second timeout the next time. The lesson is not about `sprintf`: a
# green `opa test` says nothing about production, and the gate that does say something was sitting
# in the suite the whole time.
#
# A push of code that runs inside ELDEN RING is a claim that the code works. This refuses that
# claim when no run has executed the code being pushed.
#
# The failure it was written for, 2026-09-09. Two commits were authored and a push attempted for
# both: `enable_toggle_key` on F3, a key that had never been pressed in the game, and a
# stall-watchdog fix whose code had never executed, because the DLL in the running process had been
# built two commits earlier. The user stopped the push and asked for this guard in the same breath.
# AGENTS.md already carried the rule -- commit after a runtime validation run completes, and only
# if the run showed the change is worth keeping -- as prose. Prose did not stop it, twice in one
# evening, and the standing repo rule is that a correction which must survive the turn belongs in
# executable enforcement rather than in a note.
#
# Which repository the verdict is about is decided by the signal as well, and it is not always the
# one the session is working in. A `cd <other worktree> && git push` moves the push, and until
# 2026-09-13 the signal measured the session's own tip anyway: it refused a push that changed no
# crate, and it would have passed a push that changed thirty. The signal reads the pending command
# out of the event cupcake pipes to it and resolves the checkout through
# `scripts/cupcake_push_target_repo.py`; when that cannot be resolved the verdict is `UNKNOWN`,
# which lands on the rule below that a guard who cannot see must not invent a verdict.
#
# What counts as evidence is decided by the signal, not here, and it is deliberately narrow: a DLL
# log whose own first line says `build git=<sha>` for the tip commit, with no `+dirty`. The first
# draft of that signal compared file mtimes instead and answered OK on a log written by a build two
# commits old that happened to still be running -- newer file, older code. A guard that reads a
# clock and calls it provenance reproduces the bug it is guarding.
#
# What this does NOT do, on purpose:
#   * It does not fire when no crate changed. A docs, scripts or policy push has nothing for a run
#     to prove, and a guard that fires on everything is one the next agent overrides by reflex.
#   * It does not fire when the signal cannot measure. UNKNOWN is not MISSING. A guard that cannot
#     see must not invent a verdict; the pre-push hook and CI still stand behind it.
#   * It does not adjudicate whether the run PASSED. That is a judgement about evidence, and this
#     asks only whether evidence for this code exists at all. A run that executed the code and went
#     badly is a fact worth pushing with; a run that never executed it is not evidence of anything.

# The signal is a bare word and this is a string comparison, which keeps the parsing in bash where
# it can be selftested. That was originally chosen for a wrong reason -- see the header: the
# parsing forms that "did not survive the round trip" were not failing on parsing at all, they
# were failing on `sprintf` in the deny reason. The shape is kept because it is still the better
# one, not because the alternatives were measured to be broken.
