#   description: >-
#     Hard block on a whole-workspace cargo invocation from an agent Bash command:
#     a compiling subcommand with no `-p`/`--package`, or one that says
#     `--workspace`/`--all` outright. Naming what to build is the AGENT's work. It
#     is the same reasoning already done to decide what to edit, and delegating it
#     to the build system is what turns a thirty-second question into an hour,
#     because the build system's answer to an unscoped request is always "all of
#     it".
#
#     MEASURED 2026-09-02 (bd subagent-full-check-sh-sleep-poll-is-the-hour-long-tax-2026-09-02):
#     three er-npc-possess subagents each ran ~72 minutes. Almost none of that was
#     the research they were dispatched for -- the Ghidra MCP accounted for 51
#     calls totalling 59 seconds. What consumed the time was whole-workspace
#     validation, run repeatedly, in separate worktrees with separate target/ dirs
#     so no build cache was shared. Four ran concurrently on a 16-core box: load
#     average 54.26, and a gate that costs minutes on a quiet tree was still
#     unfinished at 19 minutes. Because it far outruns the Bash tool timeout each
#     agent then sleep-polled its own run -- 18x `sleep 118` = 2003s for one, 60x
#     `timeout 28 sleep 27` = 1330s for another -- and a poll costs a whole model
#     turn, not merely its sleep. One agent spent 33 of its 45 tool-minutes asleep.
#
#     `cargo test -p er-npc-possess` is seconds and answers the question the agent
#     actually has. The whole-workspace gate is the ORCHESTRATOR's job, run once at
#     integration on a quiet tree -- which is also the only condition under which
#     its verdict means anything, since scripts/check.sh reports NOT RUN and
#     INCONCLUSIVE steps and a contended box manufactures both. That restriction
#     lives INSIDE check.sh, which knows its own repo_root and so cannot be evaded
#     by cd'ing; it is deliberately NOT enforced here. A first draft of this policy
#     did deny the gate by name and immediately blocked the edit that was removing
#     it, because the file being edited contains the string -- the same defect
#     block_manual_pgrep documents as "a guard whose own removal cannot be
#     described in the commit that removes it is unwritable in the repo that
#     enforces it".
#
#     Exempt by shape, not by intent: `cargo fmt` (whole-tree formatting is the
#     point, and it compiles nothing), the non-building `cargo metadata`/`tree`/
#     `--version`, a `-p`-scoped invocation however many crates it names, and the
#     narrow non-executing TEXT positions every guard in this directory shares --
#     a single non-chained bd command, or a git commit message.
#   routing:
#     required_events: ["PreToolUse"]
#     required_tools: ["Bash"]

# `cargo xwin build` is the same shape with one word in between, hence the

# --- decision ----------------------------------------------------------------

block_reason := "🧁 Cupcake blocked an UNSCOPED cargo invocation. Name the crates: `cargo test -p <crate>`, repeating -p for each one your change touches. Deciding which those are is your work, not the build system's -- its answer to an unscoped request is always 'all of it'. MEASURED 2026-09-02: three subagents each burned ~72 minutes, almost none of it on the research they were sent to do (the Ghidra MCP was 51 calls / 59s total). The cost was whole-workspace validation run repeatedly in worktrees with unshared target/ dirs: four concurrent runs, load average 54 on 16 cores, a gate still unfinished at 19 minutes, then 2003s and 1330s spent sleep-polling because it outruns the Bash timeout. `--workspace` and `--all` are the explicit spelling of the same thing and are blocked too. Exempt: `cargo fmt`, and the non-building `cargo metadata`/`tree`/`--version`. If a command may exceed the Bash timeout, launch it with run_in_background: true -- never `sleep N; tail log`, which converts wall time into model turns at 1:1. See bd subagent-full-check-sh-sleep-poll-is-the-hour-long-tax-2026-09-02."
