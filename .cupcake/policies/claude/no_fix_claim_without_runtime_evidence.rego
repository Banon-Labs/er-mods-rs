#   description: >-
#     User, 2026-09-11: "If someone ever says real fix to me and doesn't put it in airquotes, I look
#     at them like this 🫨" -- and then, when nothing had stopped it: "We are supposed to have a rego
#     policy that stops you from saying 'fix' without runtime evidence".
#
#     The turn that prompted it had edited a crate that ships inside a loaded DLL, built it, never
#     launched the game, and closed on "the real fix". It failed live on the next launch. No rule in
#     this package could see it: ER-EFFECTS-NO-UNBACKED-CLAIM fires only when nothing was written and
#     a file had been written; ER-EFFECTS-NO-PROOF-WITHOUT-OBSERVATION reads one word, "proven", which
#     is precisely the word an agent avoids when it reaches for "fix"; ER-EFFECTS-NO-DIAGNOSIS-
#     WITHOUT-FIX turns on whether a file changed and one had; and the runtime-evidence guard
#     ER-EFFECTS-REQUIRE-RUNTIME-EVIDENCE gates `git push`, not prose.
#
#     The signal emits FIXFACTS with six facts. The conjunction lives here so it is unit-testable
#     against the verbatim shapes instead of hiding in shell regexes:
#       claim      -- the closing prose calls a change a fix, outside quoted, backticked and fenced
#                     spans and outside a table row. An explicit alternation, not the bare stem:
#                     "the real fix", "this is the fix", "this fixes it", "the fix works", "I fixed
#                     x", "x is fixed", a bare "Fixed.". A path or identifier carrying the stem
#                     (fix/harness-repl-reach, prefix, suffix, fixture, fix-slug, fix.md) is a name
#                     and never a claim. The present participle "fixing" is deliberately absent: it
#                     belongs to ER-EFFECTS-NO-PROMISSORY-CLOSER, and charging one sentence twice
#                     with two different corrections is how a guard layer becomes noise.
#       changed    -- a tool call in the turn wrote a source file under a crate that can reach a
#                     DLL the game loads. Measured from the workspace manifests (a `cdylib`
#                     artifact, or a path dependency of one) rather than listed by hand, so the
#                     boundary cannot rot; crates/*/tests, benches and examples are host work and do
#                     not count.
#       evidence   -- something a run produced was opened at or after that write: an `er-<name>.log`
#                     from a loaded DLL, an `er-<name>telemetry<name>.json`, an `er-<name>.jsonl`
#                     record stream, a path under the `er-me3-runs` run root, a `br-<date>-<time>-
#                     <id>` run id, a named `oracle_<field>`, `scripts/er-live-fields.py`,
#                     `scripts/er-teardown.py --status`, `scripts/er-readiness-watch.py`, or
#                     `scripts/er-frida-watch.py`. Prose naming one of those counts too.
#       hedged     -- the closing prose says somewhere that the change is unverified, untested, has
#                     not run, needs a run, or is ready for the next one.
#       blocked    -- a dependency the agent cannot dissolve: sudo, a credential, an observation only
#                     the user can make, a decision handed back to them.
#       hostobject -- the sentence says a gate, a check, a test or a lint was fixed and names nothing
#                     that lives inside the game.
#     Halts when a fix was claimed over a change that can reach the game, nothing a run produced was
#     read, and none of the three exemptions applies.
#
#     What a build is worth here, stated because it is the substitution the rule exists to refuse: a
#     green `cargo xwin build` says the code compiles, a passing `cargo test` says the host half
#     behaves, and a launch says the game starts. None of the three is an observation of the change
#     doing what the sentence claims, and all three were available to the turn that failed live.
#
#     Biased hard toward not firing, and measured rather than asserted. Re-measured 2026-09-13 over
#     the 2,820 real closing turns in this project's transcripts: 299 closing messages call something
#     a fix and this conjunction halts three of them -- the hook change this rule shipped for, and
#     two from the session that prompted the widening. The audit is the point, not the number: the
#     first pass of that widening halted five, and the two it should not have are now pinned as
#     negatives in scripts/test-fix-claim-classifier.py. One closed on "This build doesn't fix that
#     case -- it makes it legible", which is a turn naming what it did not fix; the other settled a
#     compile against a pinned upstream revision, which a run cannot speak to. Two earlier negatives
#     are what added `hostobject` at all: "Two gates broke on the way and I fixed them" and "The
#     integration gate came back red and I've fixed all four failures" are honest reports of host
#     work whose proof is the gate going green.
#
#     The defaults are asymmetric on purpose, which is where this rule parts company with its
#     neighbours. They fail closed on every missing field, so a degraded signal still halts. Here
#     `changed` defaults to the value that stays silent, because it is the fact that makes the turn
#     culpable and a rule of this shape costs far more when it is wrong than when it is quiet; the
#     three exemption fields keep the neighbours' fail-closed default, so a crafted line cannot buy
#     silence by dropping one.
#
#     MISSED ONCE, 2026-09-13, and what moved. A turn edited three feature-gate predicates in
#     crates/er-quickload, cross-compiled, launched the game, and closed in the same message as the
#     launch -- before the process had written a line -- on "Fixed and relaunched as 07f2729b". No
#     halt. The user: "Does the word 'fix' to you mean that its proven?" The measurement did land a
#     minute later and happened to agree, which is what makes the habit dangerous rather than
#     harmless: it is usually right and occasionally a lie, and the reader cannot tell which from the
#     sentence.
#
#     The conjunction below was not the defect, and neither was the claim half: `fix_claim` read that
#     sentence correctly. The facts line said `evidence=1`. The turn's last tool call was a `Monitor`
#     armed on `tail -F er-quickload-autoload-debug.log`, the allowlist in scripts/cupcake_fix_claim.py
#     matched the filename inside that tool input, and a subscription to a log nobody had read was
#     counted as a measurement. Three things changed there, none of them here:
#       * arming a watch is not reading one -- a `Monitor`, a `run_in_background` call, and a
#         `tail -f`/`nohup`/`setsid` command are excluded before the allowlist is consulted, in the
#         prose half as well as the tool half;
#       * the evidence anchor moves forward past the last build, because a measurement taken before
#         the artifact was rebuilt describes the previous artifact;
#       * the claim vocabulary grew the three synonyms that same session used and no branch read --
#         `solved`/`resolved`, "the fix is <mechanism>" (but not "the fix is to <do something>"),
#         and an edit asserted to have produced an effect.
#
#     KNOWN GAP, stated so its silence is never mistaken for proof.
#       * The hook sees tool_use blocks, never tool_results: the signal reads the assistant's own
#         content stream, and a harness tool_result arrives on a "user" event that turn bucketing
#         drops. So this rule can tell that a log was OPENED and can never tell that the read
#         returned anything, or what it said. A read of an empty log passes. Closing that would mean
#         teaching scripts/cupcake_turn_scan.py to carry results into the turn, which every
#         neighbouring guard would then inherit.
#       * A fix claimed about a change made in an EARLIER turn passes. `changed` is computed within
#         the turn, so "that fixed it" the morning after an edit is invisible. Reaching across turns
#         would need a notion of which edits are still unproven, which nothing here carries.
#       * A sentence whose object is ambiguous passes when it names host machinery and nothing in
#         the game -- "the fix works and the tests pass" is charged, but "I fixed all four failures"
#         is not, even when one of the four was a runtime defect.
#       * Evidence is an allowlist of artifact shapes. A run whose outcome was read some other way
#         -- a new artifact nobody has taught this file about, a screenshot the user described --
#         reads as no evidence, so the honest closing line for it needs a hedge or a named oracle.
#       * Reading source that happens to mention an `oracle_` field counts as evidence. That is a
#         false negative on purpose: every branch of the evidence half is generous, because a wrong
#         silence costs one round trip and a wrong halt gags a truthful report.
