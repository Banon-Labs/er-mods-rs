# Seamless Co-op DLL bundling detection.
#
# The repo rule is about MOVING/PACKAGING the file (copy, move, archive, stage
# into a me3 profile / target bundle / release artifact) -- NOT about naming it.
# Documentation, issue text, commit messages and knowledge-base memories that
# merely MENTION `ersc.dll` while describing Seamless compatibility are exactly
# what AGENTS.md asks agents to record, so every arm below requires a real
# file-moving/packaging VERB acting on the path:
#
#   (a) a copy/archive/interpreter command word at command position with the
#       path as an operand, in the quote-scrubbed command;
#   (b) a redirect whose write TARGET is the file;
#   (c) a library copy/archive CALL (shutil.copy2, tarfile, ...) -- code-shaped
#       tokens that do not occur in English prose; or
#   (d) a copy/archive verb heading the very statement that names the path,
#       which catches quoted operands (`cp 'SeamlessCoop/ersc.dll' dist/`) that
#       the quote scrub removes from (a).
#
# False positive fixed 2026-07-28: `$HOME/.local/bin/bd remember "... works
# identically under Seamless Co-op (ersc.dll redirects paths ...)" --key ...`
# was denied. Two independent defects: the bd text exemption below matched only
# a hard-coded `/home/banon/...` path (never the `$HOME/...` form AGENTS.md
# actually documents), and the old fallback denied on `ersc.dll` appearing
# anywhere together with ANY of the substrings "stage"/"bundle"/"archive"/
# "tar"/"rar"/"zip" -- which match inside ordinary words like "target",
# "startup", "library" and "staged". That made every doc/memory/commit/PR body
# about Seamless compatibility unwritable.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# (a) copy/archive command word + unquoted path operand.
#
# False positive fixed 2026-08-15: neither alternative here was anchored to a
# WORD boundary after the verb, so `[^;|&()]*` let the match start partway
# through an unrelated command word whose PREFIX happened to equal one of
# these tokens. `zipinfo ersc.dll` (a read-only listing, not `zip`) and even
# nonsense like `ddrescue ersc.dll` / `lnstat ersc.dll` denied on that basis.
# A real invocation always has whitespace between the command word and its
# first operand, so requiring `[[:space:]]` immediately after the verb keeps
# every genuine `cp`/`mv`/`tar`/... shape denied while a same-prefix word in
# command position no longer counts as the verb.

# (a') interpreter command word + unquoted path operand. An interpreter can
# only bundle through the script/code it runs, so a read-only scan whose
# every ersc.dll mention is an absolute drive-mount (game-install) operand
# path is exempt -- see ersc_interpreter_gameinstall_scan_only below. All
# other interpreter + operand shapes deny exactly as before.
#
# False positive fixed 2026-08-15: same missing-word-boundary defect as (a)
# above, but worse here because `sh` is a two-letter prefix of many common
# read-only tool names. `sha256sum "$staged" /path/ersc.dll | sed '...'`
# denied a plain hash-compare of two files -- `[^;|&()]*` let the match start
# on the "sh" INSIDE "sha256sum" (also matches shasum, sha1sum, shred, and
# any other word merely starting with "sh"), not on a real `sh` invocation.
# Requiring `[[:space:]]` right after the interpreter token, and folding
# `python`/`python3` into `python3?` so the boundary applies to both, closes
# that gap the same way (a) does; a real `sh -c ...` / `python3 ...` /
# `bash script.sh ...` invocation always has whitespace after the interpreter
# word, so this only removes prefix-substring false matches, not real ones.

# "... do not use start_protected_game.exe ..."` was denied because the
# raw-substring fallbacks scan the whole tool payload, and generic executable
# markers ("bash", "python", "shell", ...) routinely appear in issue prose.
# bd only records text -- it never executes its arguments -- so for a single,
# non-chained Bash invocation of the real bd binary the quoted argument text
# is documentation, not an executable payload.
#
# The exemption is deliberately narrow:
#   * Bash tool only, command starting with the real bd binary path and a
#     text-recording subcommand. The path is matched CURRENT-USER-AGNOSTICALLY
#     (`$HOME`/`${HOME}`/`~`/`/home/<user>`/`/root`/`/Users/<user>`, or a bare
#     `bd`): AGENTS.md documents the invocation as `$HOME/.local/bin/bd`, and a
#     hard-coded `/home/banon/...` literal silently disabled this exemption for
#     the documented form and for every other user's home (2026-07-28). The
#     path may also be QUOTED (`"$HOME/.local/bin/bd" remember ...`), which is
#     the ordinary way to write it when the home path could contain a space --
#     the unanticipated leading `"` was the entire reason a bd memory ABOUT
#     the EAC launcher was denied on 2026-08-04;
#   * the quote-scrubbed command must contain no separators, subshells,
#     redirects, or backticks (so no second command rides along); and
#   * the raw command must contain no `$(` or backtick anywhere (command
#     substitution inside double quotes executes even though the quote scrub
#     removes it from scrubbed_command).
# Anything chained or indirected falls through to the raw-text scan, and the

# scan clean, redirection line clean, name quoted); the SOLE failing condition
# was `terminator_parts[1] == ""` -- the two trailing inert statements. That
# dropped the payload into the substring fallback, whose entire test is "the

#   import os,glob

#   if comm in ('eldenring.exe','me3','start_protected_game.exe'): hits.append(comm)
#   print('game running:', hits if hits else 'none')
#   "
#
# Nothing is launched: the launcher name is a python string literal in a
# membership test, and AGENTS.md explicitly allows "process detection of stale
# start_protected_game.exe". It was denied because the exemptions above
# whitelist whole-command SHAPES -- `[cd X &&] python3 -c '...'` plus three
# fixed heredoc prefixes -- so ANY additional statement, even a read-only one,
# drops the payload into the raw substring fallback, which denies on the bare
# name plus a generic marker word ("python", "bash", ...). That made the
# sanctioned detection idiom unwritable in a preflight.
#
# This arm asks a structural question instead of matching whole-command shapes:
# WHERE does the name occur? A launch needs the name to reach an exec as a
# SHELL WORD (`./start_protected_game.exe`, `wine /opt/er/...`, `setsid
# 'start_protected_game.exe'` -- shell quoting does not make a word data) or as
# an argv element of an exec call inside a program. So the exemption requires
# every occurrence to be a NESTED string literal: quote-wrapped at one level
# AND inside a shell-quoted region at another (`'name'` inside "..." or "name"
# inside '...'), which is only reachable as an inline interpreter program's own
# literal, never as a shell word. Splitting the command on a quote character
# puts quoted content at ODD indices, so the nested forms can be counted
# exactly and compared against the total occurrence count: if even one
# occurrence sits anywhere else, the counts differ and the fallback denies.
#
# Fail-closed companions, each closing a specific escape:
#   * no `$(` / backtick anywhere -- a command substitution INSIDE the quoted
#     program is expanded by the shell before the interpreter sees it, so
#     `python3 -c "... $( 'start_protected_game.exe' ) ..."` would otherwise
#     execute a nested-looking literal;
#   * the quoted text must mention `/proc` -- this exemption is for the
#     sanctioned process-state reader, not for arbitrary payloads that happen
#     to quote the name;
#   * no exec mechanism inside the QUOTED text (subprocess, os.system, exec*,
#     wine/proton/steam://, ...) -- scoped to the quoted regions so an
#     unrelated read-only `bash -c` statement elsewhere in the preflight no
#     longer poisons the whole payload, while any exec mechanism in the program
#     that actually names the launcher keeps the exemption off; and
#   * the name must not appear in non-command tool fields.
# Heredoc bodies have no enclosing shell quotes, so they never satisfy this arm

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The launcher NAMED AS DATA by a command that cannot execute it.
#
# False positive fixed 2026-08-04. Recording a knowledge-base memory ABOUT the
# launcher was denied:
#
#   "$HOME/.local/bin/bd" remember "... start_protected_game.exe (24 chars)
#   could not match /proc/<pid>/comm, which the kernel truncates at 15 chars
#   ... run bash scripts/er-stale-run-sentinel.sh" --key <key>
#
# The offending construct is the substring fallback arm, whose entire test is
# "the payload contains the name" plus `executable_source_marker` -- a set of
# generic words ("bash", "python", "shell", "exec", ...) that occur constantly
# in ordinary prose. Naming a file is not running it. AGENTS.md forbids
# LAUNCHING the EAC launcher while explicitly permitting detection of stale
# `start_protected_game.exe` processes, so documenting, grepping, committing or
# remembering the name has to stay writable -- otherwise the rule cannot be
# described in the repo that enforces it, nor can the repo's own stale-run
# sentinel be discussed by the name it detects.
#
# Three shapes qualify, and ALL additionally require that no process-execution
# mechanism (`proc_scan_exec_markers`: subprocess/os.system/exec*/spawn/ctypes/
# `sh -c`/wine/proton/steam://...) appears anywhere in the command:
#
#   (I) every occurrence sits in a statement headed by a command that does not
#       execute its arguments (`bd`, `echo`, `printf`, `git`, `gh`, `cat`,
#       `grep`, `sha256sum`, ...). The head is matched on its BASENAME so
#       `"$HOME/.local/bin/bd"` counts as `bd`, and the head set is an
#       ALLOWLIST: an unrecognised head (`setsid`, `nohup`, a repo script, or
#       the launcher itself in command position) keeps the guard on. Statement
#       boundaries are `;`, `&` and newlines; parentheses are token separators
#       rather than statement separators, so ordinary prose -- "the launcher
#       (start_protected_game.exe) is forbidden" -- stays inside its inert
#       statement while `x; (wine <name>)` still exposes `wine` as the head.
#
#  (II) the whole command is a SINGLE simple command -- the quote-scrubbed
#       skeleton holds no separator, subshell, redirect or newline, so
#       everything interesting is inside quotes -- its head word is inert or an
#       inline interpreter (`python3 -c "print('... <name> ...')"`), and every
#       occurrence sits inside a quoted region. A quoted region of a simple
#       command is one shell WORD, so the name there is program text or an
#       argument, never a command. The head allowlist is what keeps `eval
#       "'<name>'"`, `setsid "'<name>'"` and `env "..."` denied, and shells
#       (`bash`, `sh`) are deliberately absent from it.
#
# (III) the same inline-program idea for an interpreter program delivered by a
#       QUOTED-TAG HEREDOC (`python3 - <<'PY' ... PY`), which shapes (I) and
#       (II) both refuse outright because they ban `<<`. Defined in its own
#       section below `launcher_inert_heads`.
#
# Shared fail-closed shape for (I) and (II): Bash tool only; no `$(` and no
# backtick anywhere (a command substitution inside a quoted argument is expanded
# by the shell before the inert command ever sees it); no heredoc (heredoc
# payloads keep the dedicated shapes above and shape (III) below); no `|` at
# all, so `echo <name> | sh` cannot ride through on an inert head; and the name
# must not appear in non-command tool fields.
#
# Every command-position and executor-verb regex arm above is untouched and
# still denies independently of this exemption, which can only ever silence the
# substring fallback.

# (III) The launcher NAMED AS DATA inside a heredoc-delivered interpreter

# from a module docstring was denied:
#
#     python3 - <<'PY'
#     p = Path('scripts/frida-dump-module.py')
#     old = """* Offline `eldenring.exe` ONLY. Refuses `start_protected_game.exe` / EAC, like the sibling
#       `frida-nudge.py`.
#     """
#     p.write_text(p.read_text().replace(old, ''), encoding='utf-8')
#     PY
#
# The offending construct is again the substring fallback arm, whose whole test
# is "the payload contains the name" plus `executable_source_marker` -- generic
# words including the literal string "python", which an interpreter invocation
# always supplies. `scrubbed_command` drops the heredoc BODY, so no
# command-position regex ever sees the mention, and shapes (I)/(II) above refuse
# `<<` outright, so a heredoc program had no way through no matter how inert it
# was. That made this repo's own refusal logic and safety documentation -- which
# deliberately NAMES the forbidden binary -- uneditable by the guard enforcing
# it.
#
# What distinguishes an EDIT from a LAUNCH here is not the interpreter's name;
# it is where the mention sits and whether the program has any way to start a
# process at all:
#
#   * the WHOLE command is one interpreter invocation reading a heredoc whose
#     tag is QUOTED (`<<'PY'`). A quoted tag makes the body fully literal, which
#     is why the body may contain backticks and `$(` -- the docstring above has
#     markdown backticks -- while the pre-heredoc region may not (it is real
#     shell; the shape regex excludes `(` and backtick there, and an UNQUOTED
#     tag fails `proc_scan_heredoc_tag` and is refused);
#   * nothing rides after the terminator, and the terminator is the last token,
#     so no shell is chained onto the program;
#   * every occurrence of the name is inside a quoted string literal
#     (`detection_unquoted_command`, the quote-scrub of the RAW command, must
#     not contain it), so it is program TEXT, never a shell word or an argv
#     element in command position;
#   * no process-execution mechanism appears anywhere in the command --
#     `proc_scan_exec_markers` in FULL, including the wine/proton/steam wrapper
#     words that shapes (I)/(II) exclude, because a heredoc body gets no
#     statement-head analysis to catch them structurally; and
#   * no dynamic attribute/namespace lookup that could reassemble an exec call
#     out of fragments no literal marker matches (`getattr(os, 'sy' + 'stem')`).
#     This makes shape (III) strictly narrower than the `/proc`-scanning
#     heredoc exemption above, which has no such condition.
#
# The `/proc`-mention requirement of `proc_scan_detection_or_teardown_command`
# is deliberately NOT reused: it is a scoping heuristic, not a safety property
# (any payload could satisfy it with a comment), and requiring it here would
# only mean documentation edits get denied unless they mention `/proc`.
#
# Every command-position and executor-verb regex arm above is untouched and
# still denies independently; this can only ever silence the substring fallback.
