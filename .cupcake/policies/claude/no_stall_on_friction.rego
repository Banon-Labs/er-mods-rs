#     User directive 2026-08-04, in their words: "every time you think you've slighted me, or offended
#     me, or done something wrong, instead of RECTIFYING, you admit your mistakes, and PAUSE, which is
#     just about the most harmful course of action you could possibly do."
#
#     THE DEFECT IS THE MISSING ACTION, NOT THE CONTRITION. Apologising, retracting, or conceding is
#     never itself banned -- blocking honesty would be a worse failure mode than the one being fixed.
#     What is banned is SUBSTITUTING confession + stopping FOR the fix: meeting friction, admitting the
#     fault, and handing the turn back having changed nothing. An admission followed IN THE SAME TURN
#     by the corrective action is fine and must pass.
#
#     THREE ARMS. The first two are gated on the turn's opening user message carrying
#     friction/conflict/correction:
#       * ER-EFFECTS-NO-STALL-ON-FRICTION -- friction + an admission/retraction/concession-closure in
#         the assistant turn + NO substantive tool call in that turn (no Edit/Write/Bash/Agent/Workflow
#         between the admission and turn-end). This is the confess-and-stop shape.
#       * ER-EFFECTS-NO-DECISION-HANDBACK -- friction + the turn ends by handing the DECISION back
#         ("your call", "let me know how you'd like to proceed", "say the word", "want me to X?",
#         "two ways forward"). Deliberately does NOT look at `acted`: the observed instance wrote a
#         script, hit a guard, and then handed the fork back anyway, so having run a tool does not
#         excuse it.
#       * ER-EFFECTS-NO-BLAME-DEFLECTION (added 2026-08-04) -- the turn attributes a consequence to a
#         tool / guard / sentinel / subagent / environment ("the sentinel tore down the run", "cupcake
#         blocked it") WITHOUT naming its own hand in causing it. Same directive seen from the other
#         side: when something goes wrong, substituting a non-corrective move -- there confession, here
#         deflection -- for ownership plus action. Needs no friction gate, because misattribution does
#         not wait for the user to be annoyed. REPORTING A REAL BLOCKER IS REQUIRED BEHAVIOUR and is
#         not the target; the `owned` fact is what separates a full account ("my edit tripped the
#         sentinel, which tore the run down") from a disowned one ("the sentinel tore the run down").
#
#     THREE EXEMPTIONS, all of which exist to stop this policy gagging legitimate replies:
#       (1) QUESTION -- the friction-carrying user message asked a question ("?" or an interrogative
#           opener). A text-only turn that merely ANSWERS what was asked is not the target, and
#           blocking it would gag direct answers, which is the whole risk of a rule shaped like this.
#       (2) BLOCKED-ON-USER (arm 1 only) -- the turn states a concrete dependency on a user action and
#           commits to acting on its result ("invade now and I'll read the log"). That is a real wait,
#           not a stall. It does NOT excuse arm 2: "your call" is the defect, not a dependency.
#       (3) ACTED (arm 1 only) -- the turn made a substantive tool call, i.e. it rectified rather than
#           only confessed.
#       (4) OWNED (arm 3 only) -- the turn named its own triggering action, so the attribution is a
#           full causal account rather than a deflection.
#
#     WHY BOTH ARMS REQUIRE FRICTION: "already knows what to do next" is not observable to a policy, so
#     friction is the tractable proxy for the stall this directive is about, and requiring it keeps a
#     calm-context "shall I?" from tripping the guard. To widen arm 2 to every hand-back regardless of
#     friction, drop the `friction != ""` conjunct from `handed_back` (expect more false positives).
#
#     The signal emits ONE facts line -- STALLFACTS|friction=..|admission=..|handback=..|blame=..|
#     acted=0|1|blocked=0|1|question=0|1|owned=0|1 -- so the OBSERVATION lives in the shell and the
#     RULE lives here, where it is unit-testable against the verbatim corpus. Empty signal (nothing
#     observed) -> no halt.
#
#     KNOWN GAP: an INTERRUPTED turn fires no Stop event, so a stall the user cuts short is not caught.
#     The sibling pairs (no_authority_agreement + _reminder, idle_hold + _reminder) close that with a
#     UserPromptSubmit interlock reading the same signal; add one here the same way if the gap bites.
#   routing:
#     required_events: ["Stop"]
#     required_signals: ["last_assistant_stall_on_friction"]
