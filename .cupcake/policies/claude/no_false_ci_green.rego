# title: Green is a claim about CI, and CI is measurable -- so measure it before saying it

#   description: >-
#     Puts the MEASURED CI state of the current branch's pull request into context before every
#     answer, so "green" / "passing" / "CI is clean" cannot be written from a local gate result.
#
#     MEASURED 2026-09-03. An answer described PR #384 as "pushed, green, and now carries the
#     retraction". At that moment `gh pr checks 384` read `check  pending`. The word came from a
#     local `scripts/check.sh` that had exited 0 minutes earlier and silently became a claim about
#     GitHub. The user's objection is the rule: "saying it is 'green' while CI is not passing on the
#     latest push is objectively false."
#
#     WHY THIS IS NOT A STYLE NOTE. "Green" is the word a reviewer acts on -- it is the difference
#     between merging and waiting. A local gate and CI are different job sets, and a freshly pushed
#     commit routinely has NOTHING run against it yet, so the local result is not even weak evidence
#     for the remote one: it is evidence about a different question.
#
#     SHAPE: UserPromptSubmit context, like `wall_of_text`. A Stop halt cannot work here for the
#     reasons that policy documents at length -- its verdict is rendered to the user verbatim, and
#     it fires only after the false claim has already been read. Injecting the measurement BEFORE
#     the answer means the true state is in context at the moment the sentence is written, which is
#     the only point where the error is preventable rather than correctable.
#
#     The signal fails open: no gh, no repo, or no PR emits nothing, and nothing is asserted. An
#     ABSENT signal must never be read as "CI is fine" -- it means the question was not answered.
#   routing:
#     required_events: ["UserPromptSubmit"]
#     required_signals: ["ci_state_for_branch"]
