#   description: >-
#     Refuse a Write/Edit to `crates/**/*.rs` unless a Frida session has attached to
#     the game and reported observations since the last commit.
#
#     User directive 2026-09-16. AGENTS.md has said it for months -- "The order is
#     Frida, then Frida, then Frida, and only then a DLL: prototype with it, run the
#     experiment with it, and fix the thing with it if a hook can. Build a DLL when
#     the mechanism is already known and the code is the product, never to find
#     something out" -- and on this day the agent did the opposite twice in one
#     session: it tore the user's game down, ran a build, relaunched, and did it again,
#     to land a change whose mechanism it had never measured. The justification it gave
#     itself was an argument about a prior A/B it had already shown was confounded.
#     The user's answer was that a note is not a rule, so here is the rule.
#
#     The tell this encodes: when the reason for an edit is reasoning rather than a
#     measurement, the edit is a guess, and a guess here costs a teardown, a build and
#     a relaunch of somebody's game -- against an agent file that reloads in place for
#     nothing.
#
#     What opens the gate is `scripts/er-frida-evidence.py --check` printing PROVEN,
#     which needs a session that attached to a pid and received at least one message,
#     recorded after HEAD's commit time. The log lives under XDG_STATE_HOME, not in
#     the repo, so the Write tool being gated cannot forge its own permission. A commit
#     spends the evidence: one measurement licenses one change.
#
#     Deliberately NOT carved out: tests, doc comments, host-only crates. Every carve-out
#     is a door, and the failure this exists to stop was the agent walking through the
#     door it argued for itself. `scripts/`, `.cupcake/`, docs and every non-Rust file
#     stay editable, which is what makes it possible to build and fix this gate.
#
#     A SECOND INSTRUMENT was added 2026-09-19, and it is not one of those doors. It
#     exempts no file: it accepts a different measurement, taken at the branch by our own
#     DLL and quoted verbatim out of a live run's log, for the class Frida physically
#     cannot see -- our own unexported internals in a `cdylib` that exports only `DllMain`.
#     It is strictly narrower than the Frida path, because it opens the one crate whose
#     log it came from rather than the whole tree. The three conditions that keep it a
#     measurement (verbatim line, log newer than the last committed Rust change, real
#     crate) are enforced when the record is written, by the evidence reader.
#     A THIRD INSTRUMENT is not what arrived 2026-09-22 -- the Bash tool did. The rule
#     routed on the write TOOLS and denied on `tool_input.file_path`, and a Bash call
#     carries no such key, so the rule was undefined for it and the gate never saw the
#     edit. Measured (bd er-effects-rs-wuij): a `for c in ...; do sed -i ... crates/$c/src/config.rs;
#     done` rewrote four crate sources with no measurement behind it, and the very next
#     Edit-tool call adding a `pub fn` to the four `lib.rs` files beside them was refused.
#     Same change, same files, two different answers, decided by which tool typed it. The
#     description above says every carve-out is a door and the failure it exists to stop
#     was the agent walking through the door it argued for itself; this one nobody argued
#     for.

# in the deny body takes the whole rule with it -- so the gate opens on exactly the input that
# proves least.
#
# That is not hypothetical. Measured 2026-09-16 against cupcake 0.5.2: this signal script was the
# only one in `.cupcake/signals/` without its executable bit, an auto-discovered signal is exec'd
# directly rather than through `bash`, and the result was `Signal 'frida_evidence' failed with
# exit code 126` on every evaluation. `cupcake eval` allowed a `crates/` edit with no measurement
# behind it while `opa test` was green, because the tests all handed the rule a string.

# The blind spot this closes, measured 2026-09-19. Frida reaches the GAME; it does not reach our
# own DLLs. A release `cdylib` here exports `DllMain` and nothing else, so an unexported Rust
# static, a `pub(crate)` seam, or "which of our functions calls which of our setters" has no
# address to attach to and no name to resolve. `er-save-game-row` served its destination browser
# undressed for exactly that reason -- `gfx_swap::set_profile_05_010_edit_armed` has one caller and
# that shell does not go through it -- and the gate answered a provable defect by demanding an
# instrument which cannot see it. An agent facing that either stalls or reaches for one of the
# forgery routes `scripts/er-frida-evidence.py` names in its own docstring, and neither is the
# behaviour this was written to get.
#
# What makes it evidence rather than an argument is enforced at record time, not here: the quoted
# line must be present verbatim in the named log, the log must be newer than the last committed

# shell's branch says nothing about any other crate, so it may not open one. That makes this path

# agent go and look must never be the thing that stops it looking, and a reader has nothing to
# offer as evidence because it changes nothing.

# out. It did matter. Routing is an optimisation; the deny body is the contract. Listing readers
# rather than writers keeps the fail-closed direction the old argument was right about.

# THE SAME GATE FROM THE BASH TOOL (2026-09-22, bd er-effects-rs-wuij)
#
# Everything above reads `tool_input.file_path`, which a Bash call does not have. What
# follows asks the same question of a command's text: does this command WRITE a
# `crates/**/*.rs` path? It is deliberately written to catch the write verbs and to leave
# every read alone, because a gate whose purpose is to make an agent go and look must never
# be the thing that stops it looking -- the same reasoning that put `Read` in the list above.
#
# RESIDUE, stated rather than hidden. Three write paths are invisible here and none is
# closed by pretending otherwise:
#   * `git apply <patch>` and `patch < <diff>`, where the target path lives in the patch
#     file and not in the command;
#   * `cargo fmt` / `cargo clippy --fix`, which rewrite sources while naming none;
#   * a committed `python3 scripts/<name>.py` that writes a crate source, which the
#     sibling `bash_no_python_file_write` exempts by design.
# The first two are mechanical transformations rather than the guessed change this gate
# exists to stop. The third is a reviewed script, which is the same argument.

# Words of one segment. Tabs folded first, because a segment arrives as raw shell text and
# `split` on a single space would otherwise weld a tab-separated pair into one word.

# separators -- `shell_segments` has already split on them -- so "first non-wrapper" and "in
# a command slot" are the same word, and this takes the cheaper of the two readings.
#
# Cheaper is load-bearing, not a preference. The first draft asked
# `word_in_command_slot(words, index)` for every index, and that predicate counts the words
# before `index`, so the rule was quadratic in the length of a segment. A 3.5 KB command
# whose heredoc body is one segment of ~400 words exhausted the engine's wasm memory and

# silent at once. Measured 2026-09-22, while adding the tests below.
