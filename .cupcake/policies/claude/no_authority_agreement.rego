# title: Ban authority-coded agreement + unbacked feedback-acknowledgement prose
# authors: ["er-quickload agents"]
# custom:
#   severity: HIGH
#   id: ER-EFFECTS-NO-AUTHORITY-AGREEMENT
#   description: >-
#     User directives 2026-07-17, amended 2026-09-20. Category A -- authority-coded agreement
#     ("You're right", "Correct,", "Exactly,", "Absolutely,", "That's right") -- is banned OUTRIGHT.
#     Category B -- feedback-acknowledgement / receipt-announcement prose ("Point taken", "Got it",
#     "Understood", "Noted", "Fair point", "Makes sense", ...) -- is banned outright too. The signal
#     returns AUTH:<phrase> and ACK:<phrase>; both HALT turn-end so the agent must correct. rego cannot
#     pre-filter prose (no pre-response hook), so this is reinforce-every-turn + halt-and-correct.
#
#     Category B carried an exception until 2026-09-20: the prose was allowed when the same turn
#     recorded a beads memory. User directive removed it, because it made a memory the price of
#     replying to a correction -- so corrections became memories instead of behaviour, and the store
#     grew by one per slip. The correct response to a correction is to apply it and say nothing about
#     having received it.
#   routing:
#     required_events: ["Stop"]
#     required_signals: ["last_assistant_authority_agreement"]
