# A push in this repository runs the whole local gate suite and takes ten to fifteen minutes. That
# is past the harness cap on a backgrounded Bash command, so the obvious move is to detach it --
# `setsid nohup git push ... &` -- and the obvious move is the one that costs the user half an hour.
#
# Measured 2026-09-14. A detached push is severed from the harness: nothing remains to report its
# exit, so the only route back to the result is the agent choosing to go and read a log. It did not
# choose to. The push failed at 09:29:45 and was noticed at 09:59:07, twenty-nine minutes of a user
# waiting on a run that was already over. Arming a `Monitor` afterwards does not rescue it either:
# `tail -f` on a log nothing is writing to any more replays the history once and then watches a
# dead file for as long as it is allowed to, which on the terminal looks exactly like a run still
# in progress.
#
# So the rule is about the SHAPE of the invocation, not about intent. `scripts/er-push-watched.sh`
# runs the push in the foreground of whatever process called it; pointed at by a `Monitor`, the
# monitor process is the push, stage verdicts arrive as they happen, and the monitor ending is the
# completion notification. Nothing to poll, nothing to tear down separately.
#
# Why this is a policy and not a note. `AGENTS.md` is explicit that instruction files and `bd`
# memories are advisory and can be missed; binding behaviour needs executable enforcement. A memory
# recording "never detach a push" was written the same day and would have been read by nobody at
# the moment it mattered.
#
# What it deliberately does NOT do: it does not require a `Monitor`. A policy cannot see which tool
# will consume a command's output, so demanding one would be a check this text cannot make. It
# refuses the detachment, which is visible, and names the shape that works.
