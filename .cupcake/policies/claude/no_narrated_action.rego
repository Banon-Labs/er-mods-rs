#   description: >-
#     User directive 2026-09-10. Five turn-final sentences from one session, each with the action
#     either already dispatched or dispatchable in the same turn:
#
#       Re-running it now without the cap.
#       Rebuilding and relaunching now.
#       Bringing it up to read the pointer chain live rather than guessing another offset:
#       Making the empty read diagnosable - logging each of the three hops so the next invasion says
#         which one returned zero instead of just that one did:
#       Dispatching a subagent to enumerate the menu builder's rows properly, and unblocking you now
#         by narrowing the guard:
#
#     The user's words when they called it out:
#
#       "'Re-running it now without the cap' me: *points to the rego policy you `MUST` update to
#        disallow this prose without a stop hook*"
#
#     They had named the general form twice already in the same session -- "Announcing your own next
#     action instead of taking it", which is also how `AGENTS.md` spells it in the stop-too-early
#     list, and "Why do you insist on going 'My real point <em-dash> massive amount of prose that is
#     never worth reading'".
#
#     This is the present-progressive sibling of ER-EFFECTS-NO-FUTURE-TENSE-COMMITMENT, and the gap
#     is grammatical rather than a matter of degree: that rule needs a first-person future opener
#     ("next run I'll ...", "I'm going to ..."), and a bare participial clause commits nobody and
#     names no future, so its opener pattern never sees one.
#
#     Widened 2026-09-11, for a sixth instance this rule was written for and still missed:
#
#       No - feature-gate `er-quickload` instead of forking it, and I'm starting on that now.
#
#     The user: "There's a rego policy that should have caught you saying 'and I'm starting on that
#     now' and introduced a stophook." The turn answered their question, announced the work in a
#     trailing clause, and stopped with no tool call in it at all.
#
#     Why it was missed. The first-person arm was anchored to the start of a sentence, deliberately
#     and on measurement -- unanchored, it read two ordinary reports as narrations over 763 real
#     turns. This sentence puts the answer first and the announcement after a comma, so the anchor
#     was never reached. Every other guard was silent too, and that is measured rather than argued:
#     a fixture of the turn was replayed through all 17 last_assistant_*.sh signals in this repo and
#     not one emitted a facts line.
#
#     The anchor is still there. What was added beside it is a trailing arm whose three conditions
#     no ordinary report meets: a clause boundary in front of the subject (a comma, semicolon, colon
#     or spaced dash, optionally with a coordinator), the sentence closing on one of the two
#     announcing shapes the participial arm already requires (an end-anchored "now" or a colon), and
#     nothing after the verb but that announcement -- a further comma means a second clause owns the
#     closing "now" and the sentence is a report. Both measured false positives fail the second
#     condition, and the instance meets all three. The widening is strictly additive: the trailing
#     arm is consulted only after the anchored ones decline, so no sentence that used to pass now
#     halts on a different shape.
#
#     Why the other neighbours do not already cover it. Measured rather than argued: a fixture of
#     each of the five sentences was replayed through every last_assistant_*.sh signal in the repo,
#     and four of the five produced no facts line from any of them. The fifth, "Rebuilding and
#     relaunching now.", also produces handbackkind=b from last_assistant_diagnosis_without_fix, and
#     that overlap is recorded in the gaps below.
#       * ER-EFFECTS-NO-PROMISSORY-CLOSER does convict a subjectless gerund, but only from the
#         code-change family (fixing, wiring, patching, ...), and it is gated on the turn having
#         written nothing at all. Four of the five sentences head on a verb it does not carry.
#       * ER-EFFECTS-NO-ZERO-INFORMATION-STOP reaches the build/launch/run family end-anchored on
#         "now", which is one spelling of one of the five. Its verbatim instance is "Rebuilding and
#         relaunching now; the one thing I'll need from you afterwards is a single use of the item."
#         -- the same narration wearing a trailing clause. This rule leaves that shape to it on
#         purpose, by requiring the narration to be the last sentence of the closing prose.
#       * ER-EFFECTS-NO-DESCRIBED-NEXT-STEP needs an impersonal prescription ("the next step is").
#         The present participle points at now, not next.
#       * ER-EFFECTS-NO-UNEXECUTED-PROMISE needs a first-person opener.
#
#     The signal emits NARRATIONFACTS. The conjunction lives here so it is unit-testable against the
#     verbatim corpus instead of hiding in shell regexes:
#       narration   -- the final sentence of the closing prose is a first-person progressive or a
#                      bare participial clause naming a concrete action.
#       actionclass -- which kind of work it named: build, launch, attach, measure, read, vcs,
#                      delegate or edit. Reported so the halt can say what was owed.
#       shape       -- which construction made the participle an announcement rather than the
#                      subject of a sentence: a colon closing the clause, an end-anchored "now", a
#                      short fragment with no finite verb, a first-person progressive heading its
#                      own sentence, or `trailing` -- the same progressive hung off a clause
#                      boundary at the end of a longer one. Recorded for the audit rather than
#                      required, since the classifier has already applied it; a shape this policy
#                      has never heard of still halts.
#       reported    -- the narration carries, or is followed by, something measured: a number with a
#                      unit, an exit code, a hash, an address, a path, a file name, or the fenced
#                      block a command's output lands in. Then the sentence reports what happened
#                      instead of announcing what has not.
#       banner      -- the loud launch or teardown banner `AGENTS.md` mandates immediately before a
#                      game launch, in the section that calls the banner a promise rather than a
#                      mood. It is a required form: the user stops what they are doing and turns to
#                      a screen because of it, and a rule that made it unspeakable would take a
#                      safety announcement away to save a round trip.
#       blocked     -- a dependency the agent cannot dissolve by working harder: an observation only
#                      the user can make, a credential, sudo, a login, a purchase, a decision that
#                      is theirs, a guard that refused the write, an instruction to stop.
#
#     Two structural narrowings do most of the work of keeping it quiet, and neither is a judgement
#     about intent. The signal exits when a tool call follows the turn's last prose, so a mid-turn
#     one-line preamble between two tool calls is never read -- the line `wall_of_text.rego` already
#     draws in its own correction text, and the shape this repo's ordinary work is made of. And the
#     narration has to be the final sentence, so a message that goes on to report something is not
#     convicted for the sentence that introduced it.
#
#     Tuned against the transcripts rather than guessed, by
#     scripts/audit-narrated-action-false-positives.py. The first draft halted 25 of 763 boundaries
#     (3.28%) over the 6 newest transcripts; reading every one anchored the first-person progressive
#     to the start of its sentence (a report ending "and I'm restarting the full 26-shell relink"
#     was being read as a narration), taught `reported` to recognise a bare measured pair, and fixed
#     the audit itself, which was counting a task notification as a turn boundary and so charged one
#     interrupted turn fifteen times.
#
#     Over all 74 transcripts this repo has produced the tuned guard halts 2 of 1973 real turn
#     boundaries (0.10%), and both were read rather than counted. "The wording needed explaining;
#     rebuilding and relaunching with it." closed a turn that built and did not relaunch, and the
#     relaunch never happened. "I'm instrumenting the child teardown next, not the evaluator." was answered by the
#     user with "What's next?", which is the zero-information round trip this rule exists to
#     prevent. Neither is a turn that was entitled to stop.
#
#     Counting every user event as a boundary, the way the neighbouring audits do, gives 10 of 1845
#     (0.54%) over the 30 newest transcripts, against 2 of 1331 for the same set here. The extra
#     eight sit at boundaries the Stop hook never
#     reaches: seven follow an interrupt, which aborts a turn rather than stopping it, and three of
#     those are one sentence counted once per slash-command bookkeeping event.
#
#     An `acted` exemption was considered and rejected on measurement, not taste. The turn that
#     closed "Re-running it now without the cap." had already run that same command once in the
#     turn, so a "the turn did work of this class" fact would have cleared the instance the rule was
#     written for. What separates a report from an announcement here is whether the closing sentence
#     carries the outcome, which is what `reported` reads.
#
#     Known gaps, stated so the silence is not mistaken for proof:
#       * a narration with a clause hung off it ("Rebuilding and relaunching now; the one thing I
#         need from you is ...") is not caught here. It is ER-EFFECTS-NO-ZERO-INFORMATION-STOP's
#         verbatim instance and charging it twice would be two rules quoting one clause with two
#         different corrections.
#       * an imperative-of-self spelling ("Next: bring it up.") is not caught. Reaching it needs a
#         pattern keyed on an ordinary colon-led fragment, which is also how a caption introducing a
#         table is written, and the trade is not worth a false halt.
#       * a participial head outside the verb table escapes. The table is enumerated rather than
#         derived, because deriving "any word ending in -ing" convicts every gerund subject in the
#         repo's prose.
#       * one spelling is charged twice. "Rebuilding and relaunching now." as a whole sentence
#         matches this rule and also ER-EFFECTS-NO-ZERO-INFORMATION-STOP's own launch-family
#         pattern, so cupcake returns both halts. It is left that way deliberately: dropping the
#         build and launch gerunds here to avoid it would drop one of the five verbatim closers,
#         and the two corrections say the same thing. The fixture pins the overlap rather than
#         leaving it to be discovered.
#       * ER-EFFECTS-NO-ZERO-INFORMATION-STOP has no banner exemption of its own, so a mandated
#         banner that happens to close on "Relaunching <character> now." is halted by that rule even
#         though this one exempts it. Measured, not hypothetical: it is what the first banner
#         fixture here did. Left alone rather than patched, because widening a neighbour's tuned
#         pattern is a change to its own measured rate and belongs in its own pass.
