# title: Ban ending a turn on a diagnosis that was not fixed
# authors: ["er-quickload agents"]
# custom:
#   severity: HIGH
#   id: ER-EFFECTS-NO-DIAGNOSIS-WITHOUT-FIX
#   description: >-
#     User directive 2026-09-09, given mid-session after five consecutive turns of it: "I don't care
#     what is broken or why, I only know what the fix looks like, and that you're still not there at
#     every turn you pause and dump prose". Naming a defect and stopping is banned. A turn that says
#     what is broken must also change a file, or state why it cannot.
#
#     The signal emits DIAGFACTS with four facts. The conjunction lives here so it is unit-testable
#     against the verbatim corpus instead of hiding in shell regexes:
#       diagnosis -- the turn named a defect / cause / fix ("the real defect is", "the bug is in",
#                    "worth fixing", "the fix is").
#       fixed     -- an Edit / Write / MultiEdit / NotebookEdit tool_use came LATER in the same turn
#                    than that sentence. Reads do not count: reading is how a diagnosis is built.
#       edited    -- the same write anywhere in the turn, ordering ignored. Read alongside `fixed`
#                    because a diagnosis in the CLOSING message has nothing after it, so `fixed` is
#                    structurally 0 there and the positional test alone convicts a turn that made
#                    the edit and then said what it had fixed.
#       asked     -- the opening user prompt asked a question. Answering is the deliverable and must
#                    never be gagged; this exemption is deliberately broad.
#       blocked   -- the turn stated a real dependency (sudo, a live game, an approval, waiting on
#                    the user). A diagnosis that cannot yet be acted on is not a stall.
#     Halts when a diagnosis was made, nothing was written, and neither exemption applies.
#
#     Why a new rule rather than widening a neighbour: ER-EFFECTS-NO-DESCRIBED-NEXT-STEP excludes a
#     bare "the fix is X" on purpose (it is how a completed fix gets reported), ER-EFFECTS-NO-IDLE-
#     HOLD needs an announcement of waiting, and ER-EFFECTS-NO-STALL-ON-FRICTION requires the prompt
#     to carry frustration and counts any tool call as having acted. This one turns on the single
#     fact those three cannot see: whether a file changed.
#
#     ER-EFFECTS-NO-PROMISSORY-CLOSER (added 2026-09-09) is the second rule in this package, and it
#     turns on the same fact. The shape it refuses, verbatim from the turn that prompted it:
#
#       "Fixing both: bypass the union so the naked capture is the detour entry (`MhHook::new`
#        exists for exactly that), and pass the adopted menu object to `invade` instead of the
#        synthesized box."
#
#     A present participle with no subject, announcing work as though it were already in flight,
#     closing a turn that changed nothing. It is a plan wearing the grammar of a report, and it
#     walked past every Stop guard in the repo: ER-EFFECTS-NO-UNEXECUTED-PROMISE needs a
#     first-person opener ("I'll", "I'm going to", "let me") and this sentence commits nobody, while
#     ER-EFFECTS-NO-DESCRIBED-NEXT-STEP needs a forward-looking prescription and "Fixing" points at
#     now. It lives here rather than in a fourth file because the fact that convicts it is the one
#     this signal already computes.
#
#     Its conjunction is three facts, not four:
#       promise -- the closing statement announces work in the present participle ("Fixing both:",
#                  "Now wiring the detour", "Porting the offsets.", "Next I bypass the union").
#       edited  -- a write ANYWHERE in the turn, not one after the sentence. A closer is the last
#                  thing in the turn, so nothing can follow it and `fixed` is always 0 for one; the
#                  question that separates a truthful report from an announcement is whether the
#                  turn wrote anything at all. A turn that made the edit and then said so passes.
#       blocked -- the same real-dependency exemption as above.
#     A second closing shape reports under the same rule id, because it is the same defect wearing
#     different grammar -- an observation rather than an intention, which is how it slipped past a
#     pattern keyed on "I'll" or a work gerund. Verbatim, 2026-09-09: "... and the next measurement
#     is whether the DLL is using the menu object it now captures (`r14`) for the re-invade gate or
#     still falling back to the scan -- which its own log answers, so I am reading that next." The
#     answer was in a file on disk; naming the read instead of performing it buys a round trip worth
#     nothing. Its facts:
#       unread    -- the closing prose names a concrete artifact as holding the answer and defers
#                    the read past the turn.
#       consulted -- a tool call in the turn opened a strong artifact token (a path, a filename, an
#                    address, a symbol) that the closing prose also names. A weak noun such as "its
#                    own log" cannot clear this, because almost every command in this repo mentions
#                    some log, and letting the word exempt the shape would exempt the instance
#                    above, whose turn had grepped a different run's directory.
#       future    -- the evidence does not exist yet ("the next run's log will say"), so the read
#                    could not have happened in this turn. That is a plan, not a skipped read.
#     `userneed` and `blocked` exempt it as they do elsewhere.
#
#     `asked` is deliberately NOT an exemption here, and that is measured rather than assumed: the
#     prompt "Would you expect me to have seen any feature changes?" was answered with a correct
#     explanation that closed "Fixing that now." and changed nothing. The `asked` exemption exists
#     so an EXPLANATION cannot be gagged; this arm does not fire on explanations, only on an
#     announcement of work, so inheriting the exemption would have exempted the defect itself.
#
#     ER-EFFECTS-NO-ZERO-INFORMATION-STOP (added 2026-09-09) is the third rule here, from the user
#     directive: "If nothing is the ideal response from me, in every case, this means we are lacking
#     a rego policy that adds a stop hook. Every. Single. Time. This. Happens." A turn whose ideal
#     next user reply is nothing has spent a round trip of the user's attention to say so.
#
#     The instance. Asked "What's my ideal response for you at this moment?", the turn closed
#     "Nothing -- the ball is in my court. Rebuilding and relaunching now; the one thing I'll need
#     from you afterwards is a single use of the item." The build and the relaunch were the agent's
#     own next actions, known and unblocked. Every existing guard was disarmed by the last clause:
#     ER-EFFECTS-NO-UNEXECUTED-PROMISE and ER-EFFECTS-NO-DESCRIBED-NEXT-STEP both exempt a turn that
#     hands the obligation to the user, and "I'll need from you ... a single use of the item" reads
#     as exactly that -- except that in this repo the agent drives every in-game input itself, so it
#     is not a handoff at all.
#
#     Its facts:
#       handback     -- the closing sentence that hands work back.
#       handbackkind -- a: the user is told they need do nothing; b: the agent announced its own
#                       next action instead of taking it; c: an offer to do work it is already
#                       authorised to do. b and c fire on their own. `a` fires only when the turn
#                       did no work at all (`didwork`), because "nothing on your side" after a turn
#                       that delivered is the honest end of a finished task, not a handback.
#       userneed     -- the closing prose asks for something only the user has: an observation with
#                       no memory-read oracle, a subjective or external-only decision. This is the
#                       exemption that keeps a legitimate ending legitimate. A request for in-game
#                       input is not one, because the agent drives input itself.
#       extblocked   -- a dependency outside the agent's reach: sudo, credentials, a login, a
#                       purchase, a live game, network, a gate it is waiting on. Deliberately not
#                       the `blocked` fact the other two arms read, which folds in "blocked on the
#                       user": "I need you to press X" is a dependency on the user in the letter and
#                       a handback in fact, so reading the broad fact would exempt the shape this
#                       rule exists to refuse.
#       carried      -- a subagent or a backgrounded command is genuinely still running. "Nothing to
#                       do until they report" is then a true statement about work that exists, not a
#                       handback; the same `live_background_work` helper the idle-hold guard reads.
#
#     Tuned against the transcripts, not guessed: the first draft fired on 255 of 3,749 real turn
#     boundaries (6.8%), and reading them deleted a whole fourth shape (a request for in-game input,
#     which the directive names as something that cannot exempt a handback rather than as a handback
#     itself), end-anchored the participle spelling of `b`, cut its first-person spelling to the
#     build/launch/run family, and added the offer exemption for a destructive or user-visible action
#     and for a genuine fork. See scripts/audit-diagnosis-signal-false-positives.py.
#
#     ER-EFFECTS-NO-DEFERRED-INVESTIGATION (added 2026-09-12) is the fourth rule here, and it is the
#     first arm keyed on a future tense. The shape: the closing prose names the agent's own next
#     investigative move instead of taking it. Six closers from one session, verbatim, and not one of
#     them was caught by anything in this package:
#
#       "... which is where I look next."
#       "... and the next place to look is `profile_table_guard`'s rebuild of `saveSlotsStates`."
#       "... that is the next step / the next thing I check is ..."
#       "The overlap that is real in a default build is the picker itself: ... which is where I look
#        next."
#       "... I will back out once this test says which side the bug is on."
#       "... the next step halves it to five; if it is clean, the culprit is in the excluded ten and
#        I load those instead."
#
#     It is the same failure the first rule refuses -- a finding delivered where a change was owed --
#     one tense later, so the diagnosis noun the first rule needs is absent and the sentence names a
#     move rather than a defect. The promissory arm wants a work gerund heading the sentence and
#     these are ordinary indicative clauses; the unread arm wants the prose to claim a file already
#     holds the answer. ER-EFFECTS-NO-DESCRIBED-NEXT-STEP is the nearest neighbour and misses on both
#     halves at once: its noun list wants a copula directly after ("the next step is"), which none of
#     "the next place to look is", "the next thing I check is" or "the next step halves it" gives it,
#     and its handoff exemption is cleared by a single question mark anywhere in the message.
#
#     Its facts:
#       deferral -- the closing sentence that names the next investigative move. The patterns live in
#                   the signal as a named list, one entry per shape, so a regression names the shape
#                   it broke.
#       edited   -- a write anywhere in the turn, read for the same reason the promissory arm reads
#                   it: a closer is the last thing in the turn, so `fixed` is always 0 for one.
#       blocked  -- the one-line blocker, as everywhere else.
#       userneed -- an observation only the user can make. The launch handoff has to stay speakable.
#       future   -- the move needs evidence that does not exist yet, or the user was handed a
#                   concrete in-game action. Both are legitimate deferrals, and both already live in
#                   this fact; the signal now computes it for the whole closing message rather than
#                   only inside the unread branch, which leaves that arm's behaviour unchanged.
#     `asked` is deliberately not an exemption, for the same reason it is not one on the promissory
#     arm: five of the six closers above answered a question correctly and then stopped in front of
#     the next tool call, so inheriting it would exempt the whole family.
#
#     Measured, not guessed: replayed over 913 real turn boundaries it halts 5 times (0.55%, the same
#     band as its neighbours -- promissory 0.32%, handback 0.79%). Four are instances of the defect,
#     three of them the verbatim closers above. Reading the fifth deleted a shape: "Push was the next
#     step in a script I had already run once" reports a step already taken, so the past tense is now
#     suppressed in the signal. One survivor is declared rather than exempted -- "the flow behind them
#     is the next step, not this one" scopes a turn out of work rather than deferring an
#     investigation, and every exemption that would cover it would cover the family too.
