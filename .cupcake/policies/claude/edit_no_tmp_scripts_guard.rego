# WRITE INDICATORS, EACH ANCHORED TO THE PATH ITSELF.
#
# The Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit branch above needs no such test -- those tools ALWAYS
# author the file they name. Bash does not, and the previous form of this branch could not tell
# the difference: it asked only whether an interpreter-ish word appeared ANYWHERE in the command
# and a /tmp script path appeared ANYWHERE else. Two measured false positives (2026-08-25):
#
#   python3 - <<'EOF' ... open(p) ... glob('/tmp/planner/*.js') ... EOF
#       -> READS third-party js out of /tmp. Denied because "python3" and a "/tmp/*.js" both
#          occurred in the same command.
#   mkdir -p target/planner-bundle && cp -f /tmp/planner/*.js target/planner-bundle/ && ls ...
#       -> COPIES OUT of /tmp, no interpreter at all. Denied because the alternation had no word
#          boundaries and "bun" matched inside the substring "planner-bundle", after which `.*`
#          reached the /tmp path. Same trap for cat/"concatenate", node/"node_modules",
#          tee/"committee", echo/"echoes".
#
# So the interpreter alternation is gone entirely -- an interpreter NAME says nothing about
# direction -- and each pattern below binds a real write operator DIRECTLY to the path it writes,
# capturing that path in group 1. Every command word is anchored on both sides ((^|[\s;&|(]) before,
# required whitespace after) so a substring inside an unrelated word can never arm the rule.
