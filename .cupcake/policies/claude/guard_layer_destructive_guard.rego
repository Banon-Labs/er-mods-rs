# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A LOCKDOWN (2026-08-31).
#
# `.cupcake/rulebook.yml` claimed a TOTAL LOCKDOWN of `.cupcake/` and
# `.git/hooks/` through the `rulebook_security_guardrails` builtin. That claim
# was false for the whole life of the file: cupcake 0.5.2 treats a builtin as
# DISABLED unless its config block carries `enabled: true`, and that block never
# had one, so the engine logged
#
#     Skipping disabled builtin policy: .../rulebook_security_guardrails.rego
#
# and the policy was never compiled, never routed and never evaluated. Measured
# by adding that single line to a copy of `.cupcake/`: the same Write event that
# is ALLOWED against the tree is DENIED against the copy.
#
# ENABLING IT WAS THE WRONG FIX, and the reasoning matters more than the verdict:
#
#   * it halts on Read/Grep/Glob as well as Write, so the policy layer becomes
#     UNAUDITABLE. Every guard repair made in this repo began by reading these
#     files; a rule that forbids reading the rules cannot be reviewed, only
#     obeyed.
#   * its Bash arm is `contains(lower(command), ".cupcake")` -- a raw substring
#     test over the whole command. It denies `opa test .cupcake/`, every
#     `git commit -- .cupcake/...`, and every `python3 -c` inspection one-liner,
#     while `.cup"cake"`, `.cup*` or `$(printf .cupcake)` walk straight past it.
#     It stops maintenance, not tampering.
#   * its Task arm denies any subagent prompt containing `.cupcake`, so the work
#     could not even be delegated.
#   * `.git/hooks/` is not the live hook directory here: `core.hooksPath` is
#     `scripts/hooks`, so the lockdown's second protected path guards a directory
#     git does not consult.
#   * structurally, a policy file stored IN the repo cannot defend against an
#     agent editing the repo. What actually defends these files is the 622-case
#     `opa test .cupcake/` gate, the delivered-shape gate, and the diff a human
#     reads. This rule adds one thing those cannot: it stops a BLUNT INSTRUMENT
#     from removing the guard layer before anyone can review the change.
#
# SO THE SCOPE IS DELIBERATELY NARROW: destructive SHELL operations against the
# guard layer are denied; reading, grepping, editing and testing it are allowed,
# on purpose, and Edit/Write are not routed here at all. A change to a policy
# should arrive as a diff someone can read -- not as a deletion.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a defence against a determined agent: `rm -rf .`
# from the repo root never names `.cupcake` and is not caught here (the
# protected-paths PARENT rule covers that shape only for ITS configured paths,
# and adding `.cupcake/` to that list would re-import every false positive listed
# above). Saying so plainly is the point -- a guard that overclaims its reach is
# the exact defect this file replaces.

# The two paths the rulebook claimed to lock down. Spelled without a trailing
# slash: the operand matcher below supplies its own boundary, and a bare
# `rm -rf .cupcake` names the directory with no slash at all.
guard_layer_paths := {".cupcake", ".git/hooks"}

# Verbs that REMOVE or RELOCATE. `chmod`/`chown` are deliberately absent: making
# a new `.cupcake/signals/*.sh` executable is ordinary authoring, and the
# disarming form (`chmod -x`) cannot be told from it without parsing mode
# operands -- a speculative rule is worse than an honest gap.
#
# `mv` catches `mv .cupcake .cupcake.off`; `git mv` does NOT match, because `git`
# is not one of the wrapper words `has_command_verb` steps over, which leaves the
# tracked rename available as the supported way to rename a policy.

	# EVERY text this command executes, not just the outer one: `bash -c "rm -rf
	# .cupcake"` puts the verb inside a quoted operand where no `(^|\s)` anchor
	# can reach it. commands.executed_texts decomposes the wrapper payload into a
	# text of its own, and neutralises anchors inside quoted spans so that a
	# commit message or a bd memory QUOTING this command is not read as running
	# it.
	some text in commands.executed_texts(input.tool_input.command)

	# Per SEGMENT, so a destructive verb in one statement cannot borrow a guard
	# path operand from an unrelated one: `rm -f /tmp/x && opa test .cupcake/`
	# must stay allowed.
	some segment in commands.shell_segments(lower(text))

	# THE VERB IS READ FROM THE EXECUTABLE PART OF THE SEGMENT ONLY, with quoted
	# spans DELETED -- while the PATH is read from the whole segment, quotes and
	# all. The asymmetry is deliberate and each half was measured:
	#
	#   * verb from `quotes_removed`, because a quoted operand that is not a shell
	#     payload is DATA. commands.executed_texts neutralises `;&|()` and the
	#     quote characters inside such a span, but NOT `{` or `}` -- and `{` is in
	#     has_command_verb's anchor class. So
	#
	#         python3 -c "s={'rm'}; open('.cupcake/x.rego')"
	#
	#     arrived as `python3 -c "s={ rm }  open( .cupcake/x.rego )"`, the brace
	#     put `rm` in command position, and this rule DENIED an inspection
	#     one-liner about its own policy tree. Caught in vivo on 2026-08-31, by
	#     this rule firing on a command that was auditing it -- the precise
	#     failure this policy exists to avoid, since an agent that cannot inspect
	#     the guard layer cannot repair it. Deleting quoted spans takes the brace
	#     away with the rest of the python.
	#
	#   * path from the RAW segment, because quoting a path is ordinary:
	#     `rm -rf "$repo/.cupcake"` and `rm -rf '.cupcake'` must still be caught,
	#     and quotes_removed would take the operand away with the quotes.
	#
	# A quoted span that IS executed is not lost either way: executed_texts hands
	# back each shell payload as a text of its own, where the verb stands unquoted
	# at position 0.
