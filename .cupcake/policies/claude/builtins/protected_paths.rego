# Block a destructive command hidden inside a SHELL WRAPPER PAYLOAD.
#
# `bash -c "rm -rf /"` was ALLOWED both before and after the 2026-08-31
# command-position fix (measured live, 21 wrapper spellings), and for two
# INDEPENDENT reasons that both have to be answered before the deny can happen:
#
#  1. THE VERB IS NOT IN THE OUTER COMMAND'S COMMAND POSITION. `bash` is; `rm`
#     stands inside a quoted operand. commands.has_verb never saw it either --
#     its `(^|\s)` anchor cannot match `"rm`, because the quote sits between the
#     space and the verb -- so this shape was invisible in both spellings, and
#     tightening to command position neither closed it nor widened it.
#
#  2. `input.affected_parent_directories` DOES NOT CONTAIN THE PAYLOAD'S TARGET.
#     Measured with `cupcake eval --debug-files`: the Rust preprocessor reads the
#     quoted payload as a PATH operand of `bash`, so the event arrives carrying
#
#         affected_parent_directories: ["<cwd>/rm -rf "]
#
#     and never `/`. The PARENT rule pairs its verb test with that advisory list,
#     so no amount of verb matching can reach a denial through it. Any fix that
#     only taught the verb test to see into quotes would still have allowed this.
#
# This rule therefore derives the endangered directory ITSELF, from the payload
# text, and does not consult the preprocessor at all. Both sides of the
# derivation are bounded:
#
#   * the PAYLOAD set is commands.shell_payloads_deep, which stops at THREE
#     nesting levels. Two is the deepest literal quoting reaches without escapes
#     (`bash -c 'bash -c "..."'`); the third is headroom; a fourth would need
#     escaped quotes, which are stripped before the split and so cannot form a
#     payload at all. `bash -c "bash -c \"...\""` therefore terminates rather
#     than recursing, and a wrapper this cannot read is reported by
#     commands.unparsed_shell_payload instead of being silently unwrapped.
#
#   * the CANDIDATE DIRECTORY set is protected_path_ancestors -- the ancestors of
#     the CONFIGURED protected paths and nothing else. For this rulebook that is
#     {"/", "/etc", "/System"}: at most one entry per path component, fixed by
#     configuration, unable to grow with the command text.
#
# WHY A QUOTED OPERAND THAT IS NOT A PROGRAM CANNOT START MATCHING. A quoted span
# only becomes a payload when the text before its opening quote is a shell
# awaiting its program (commands.shell_payload_prefix_pattern), checked with the
# nesting rule that already keeps a commit message describing the bypass form
# from being read as one. `git commit -m "...install... / ..."` is not a wrapper,
# produces no payload, and stays allowed -- pinned as a test either side.
#
# KNOWN-OPEN, DELIBERATELY, and it fails OPEN rather than closed: a payload this
# cannot read (`bash -c $CMD`, `bash -c $(...)`) yields no payload text, so this
# rule is silent on it. Failing closed there would deny every `bash -c "$VAR"`,
# and unlike the git guards there is no second signal (a `git` and a `push` in
# the raw text) that could narrow it -- an opaque variable names nothing at all.

# <<'EOF'` message that happens to contain the prose word "install" and a bare `/`
# between two code spans was being read as a destructive root operation, because
# the preprocessor tokenizes the whole command and reports `/` among the affected
# parent directories.  Stripping payload removes the verb AND the operand, so the
# advisory `/` no longer has anything to attach to.
#
# Shell either side of the payload is preserved: the opening line still counts (it
# is a real command), and so does anything after the terminator -- a `rm -rf /`
# following an `EOF` line is exactly as dangerous as one on its own.  An

# runs, so `lines` always has exactly one element live and no line can ever be
# payload.  It still does real work under `opa test`, which feeds raw multi-line
# text, so it is kept as defence in depth -- but a rule that needs the payload
# excluded must not lean on it.  The line-position information the split needs is

# scripts/cupcake-hook.sh rewrites an unquoted newline to `; ` so line 2 of a
# multi-line command is visible to anchored patterns at all (bd
# er-effects-rs-5eah).  The Rust preprocessor then tokenises `rm -rf /;` and
# reports the affected directory as `/;`, which is a child of nothing and a
# parent of nothing: `rm -rf /` ALONE was denied while the same delete followed
# by a second line was ALLOWED (measured 2026-08-31, both before and after the
# command-position change, so this is an independent hole rather than a
# regression from it).  Trimming the separator can only make the rule fire on
# MORE commands, never fewer.  An entry that trims away to nothing is dropped
# instead: an empty prefix would make every protected path look like a child.
#
# `(` and `)` were added 2026-08-31 for the same reason, and they closed a hole
# the OPA suite claimed was already shut. `test_deny_root_delete_inside_command_
# substitution` hand-feeds `affected_parent_directories: ["/"]` for
# `echo $(rm -rf /)` and passes; the real preprocessor reports
# `["<cwd>/$(rm", "/)"]`, and `/)` is a parent of nothing, so the SAME command
# was ALLOWED live (measured 2026-08-31, both verdicts through the real binary).
# A green deny test over a fixture production never produces is the exact defect
# this file's command_operand_region comment describes, in a second place.
