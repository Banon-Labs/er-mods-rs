# title: One paragraph of prose per turn, injected before the answer instead of scolded after it
# authors: ["er-effects-rs agents"]
# custom:
#   severity: LOW
#   id: ER-EFFECTS-WALL-OF-TEXT
#   description: >-
#     User directive 2026-08-21, stated absolutely: "I'll never. Repeat: NEVER read more than a
#     single paragraph of response text from you. Everything else is a skim."
#     Every word past the first paragraph is not merely unwanted, it is UNREAD. That makes long
#     prose actively worse than short prose: the agent believes it has communicated when it has not,
#     and any caveat, blocker or correction buried past paragraph one has effectively been withheld
#     from the person who needed it.
#     Structure is NOT prose: fenced code, tables, lists, headings and captions are exempt in the
#     signal, because the objection is to READING, and those are scanned. One paragraph plus a table
#     is fine; two paragraphs are not.
#
#     THIS WAS A Stop HALT UNTIL 2026-08-22 AND THE HALT WAS THE WRONG SHAPE. The user, in their
#     words: "That stop hook is not working if 1) I see it and 2) it doesn't prevent you from spewing
#     information." Both halves are structural facts about the harness, verified against Claude Code
#     2.1.240, not tuning problems:
#
#       (1) NO Stop VERDICT CAN BE HIDDEN. A blocking `reason` is pushed into the
#           `stop_hook_summary` system message as `hookErrors` and rendered verbatim as
#           "Stop hook error: <reason>"; `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` on Stop is rendered
#           the same way as "Stop hook feedback: <text>"; `systemMessage` is documented as
#           user-facing. `suppressOutput` gates only a hook's plain stdout, never the summary. So the
#           user reads the scolding, always.
#       (2) Stop FIRES AFTER THE TEXT IS ALREADY ON SCREEN. The assistant message is streamed to the
#           terminal and only then does the Stop event run -- its input even carries
#           `last_assistant_message`. A halt cannot unsend the wall of text; it can only append a
#           rewrite. Net effect of the old guard: the user read the long version, then the scolding,
#           then the short version. Three times the reading, from a rule that exists to reduce it.
#
#     SO THE CORRECTION MOVED TO UserPromptSubmit, which has neither problem: its
#     `additionalContext` becomes a `hook_additional_context` attachment, which the REPL filters out
#     of the rendered message list (it sits in the hidden-attachment set alongside `todo_reminder`
#     and `output_style`), and it lands in context BEFORE the next answer is written. Invisible, and
#     preventative for the turn about to start rather than punitive about the turn already read.
#
#     WHAT THIS BUYS AND WHAT IT COSTS, said plainly: an injected reminder is weaker than a halt --
#     it cannot refuse anything. The trade is deliberate, because the halt's enforcement was paid for
#     entirely out of the user's reading budget, which is the one resource this rule protects. The
#     available escalation, if the reminder proves too weak, is the same `additionalContext` on
#     PreToolUse (also invisible, also already wired with matcher "*"), re-asserted mid-turn so the
#     rule is the last thing in context before the closing message. It is not taken here because it
#     costs a transcript scan on every tool call.
#   routing:
#     required_events: ["UserPromptSubmit"]
#     required_signals: ["last_assistant_wall_of_text"]

If it will not fit in one paragraph, that is the signal to CUT content, not to add a paragraph: drop the reasoning nobody asked for, and put what remains in a table, a list or a code block, which are scanned rather than read and do not count. Mid-turn one-line narration between tool calls is fine and is not measured; this is about the message you close on."
