# Agents must not push directly to main. Work lands on feature/tooling branches;
# main is updated only through the user's preferred review/merge path. If the
# branch signal is missing, fail closed for push commands because bare `git push`
# inherits the current branch/refspec from Git config.
#
# Worktree-target exception (2026-07-30, bd
# guard-blocks-worktree-commits-from-main-session-cwd-2026-07-29): the
# current_branch signal reads the session checkout's branch, so a push issued as
# `git -C <worktree> push` from a session whose primary checkout sits on main was
# denied even when the worktree is on a feature branch. Such a push is allowed
# when every push invocation targets a registered non-main worktree.
#
# Explicit-refspec exception (2026-08-15): the same stale signal can report main
# when this session itself is rooted in a non-main worktree. A command that names
# a non-main upstream destination (`git push -u origin feature/name`) is safe to
# permit: it cannot update remote main. Bare pushes and unparsed options remain
# fail-closed. Explicit main refspecs (push_targets_main) stay denied
# unconditionally. (Its name predates the exception below and is misleading: it
# parses `-u <remote> <branch>`, which carries no `<src>:<dst>` refspec at all.)
#
# Source:destination refspec exception (2026-08-25): renaming or republishing an
# already-pushed remote branch has no sanctioned form. From a session whose
# primary checkout sits on main, this was denied:
#
#     git push origin origin/refactor/drop-dead-gates:refs/heads/split/drop-dead-gates
#
# Neither side of that refspec is main, so the command cannot update remote main,
# yet it matched neither existing exception: `pushes_target_only_nonmain_worktrees`
# wants the `git -C <path> push` form and `pushes_target_only_explicit_nonmain_branches`
# wants `-u|--set-upstream <remote> <branch>`. Both parsers stop at the first
# `<src>:<dst>` token. `pushes_target_only_explicit_nonmain_refspecs` below permits
# a command only when EVERY push in it is `git push <remote> <src>:<dst>` with both
# sides non-empty and a destination that cannot be main. push_targets_main is a
# separate blocked_push_context rule and still denies `main`, `HEAD:main`,
# `heads/main` and `feature:refs/heads/main` regardless of any exception.
#
# Shell-wrapper decomposition (2026-08-26, bd er-effects-rs-dt2e): every pattern
# below used to run against the raw command string, which asks about lexical
# position rather than about what runs. `bash -c 'git push origin main'` produced
# ZERO denials -- the character before the verb is a quote, and a quote is not in
# the anchor class -- while a `bd remember` body or a doc that merely QUOTED the
# command on its own line WAS denied, because a newline is. The patterns are
# unchanged; what changed is the text they see. They now run over
# commands.executed_texts, which returns the command with quoted operand spans
# anchor-neutralised plus every shell-wrapper payload as its own text. See the
# header of .cupcake/system/commands.rego for the decomposition and its limits.
#
# Both the deny trigger and the three exceptions read that same set, so a wrapper
# cannot hide a push AND cannot borrow another push's exception: the count-match
# the exceptions require is taken across all executed texts at once, so one
# unrecognised push anywhere -- inside a wrapper included -- still denies.

# refspec -- and a wrong parser here deletes a branch nobody asked to delete. They
# stay fail-closed until someone writes that parser with its own tests.
#
# The trailing group anchors the refspec as the LAST token of the invocation, so
