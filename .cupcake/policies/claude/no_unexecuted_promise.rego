# title: Ban ending a turn on a promise nothing is going to keep
# authors: ["er-quickload agents"]
# custom:
#   severity: HIGH
#   id: ER-EFFECTS-NO-UNEXECUTED-PROMISE
#   description: >-
#     User directive 2026-08-22, in their words: "How can I prevent you from ever saying 'I'll
#     <statement of future action>' and then landing on no shells running, no monitors, and no
#     directive to me to explain why a user is required to re-initiate the task."
#
#     The instance: a turn ended "I'll re-record the directive with the shell metacharacters escaped
#     rather than leave it unsaved" -- and then stopped. No tool call, no background task, no
#     statement that the user had to do anything. The work simply evaporated and the user had to
#     notice and re-ask. A promise made in prose is enforceable by nothing; only a Stop hook that
#     refuses the stop closes this.
#
#     THE VIOLATION IS A CONJUNCTION OF FOUR FACTS, computed in the signal:
#       1. the turn's FINAL prose block commits the agent to a CONCRETE action ("I'll re-run the
#          gate", "I'm going to patch it", "let me check the offsets", and the bare present
#          continuous "I'm closing it" -- the shape that walked through this guard on 2026-09-01,
#          because present continuous reads as already underway and is therefore the more seductive
#          way to make a promise nothing keeps);
#       2. no tool_use follows that prose in the turn -- nothing executed it;
#       3. no background work is live -- no backgrounded Bash still awaiting its result, no async
#          subagent that has not notified, no detached shell / Monitor / SendMessage in the turn;
#       4. the message does not hand the obligation to the user -- no question, no blocker
#          statement, no "once you've X", no "I'll need you to Y", no "next session".
#     Any one of the four missing means the turn is fine, and the signal stays silent.
#
#     BIASED HARD TOWARD NOT FIRING. A guard that cries wolf gets ignored, which is worse than no
#     guard, so: only the closing prose block is scanned (a mid-turn "I'll check X" followed by the
#     tool call that checks X is the correct shape and is never touched); the committed verb must be
#     on a concrete-action allowlist, which excludes stance verbs ("I'll keep that in mind"), verbs
#     the message itself fulfils ("I'll summarise"), hedges ("I'll try to") and negations ("I'll
#     never"); and quoted/backticked/fenced spans are stripped so quoting the ban cannot trip it.
#
#     The signal emits PROMISE:<clause> with the offending sentence, which the halt quotes back so
#     the agent knows exactly which sentence it has to make true or withdraw.
#   routing:
#     required_events: ["Stop"]
#     required_signals: ["last_assistant_unexecuted_promise"]

No tool call executed it, no background task or shell is carrying it, and you did not tell the user the ball is theirs -- so that work evaporates and they have to notice and re-ask. Pick one, now, before stopping: (a) EXECUTE IT in this turn with the tool call that does it; (b) START IT as a background task (a backgrounded Bash or a subagent) so something real is carrying it; or (c) REWRITE the sentence to say plainly that the user must re-initiate it AND why you cannot -- name the blocker. Deleting the promise and staying silent is not an option: if the work matters, say who does it next."])
