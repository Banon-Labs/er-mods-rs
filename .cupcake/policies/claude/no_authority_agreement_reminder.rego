# title: Reinforce the agreement/acknowledgement ban every turn (and catch interrupted-turn slips)

#     Companion to no_authority_agreement (the Stop-event halt). Two jobs on UserPromptSubmit:
#     (1) inject the ban into every turn's context so the phrasing is avoided pre-emptively; and
#     (2) INTERLOCK BACKSTOP -- if the just-finished assistant turn used banned phrasing (Category A
#     authority-coded agreement, or Category B feedback-acknowledgement) but the Stop halt did
#     not catch it (e.g. the user INTERRUPTED the turn, so no Stop event fired), inject a HIGH-priority
#     mandatory-correction directive on the next prompt. UserPromptSubmit always runs, even after an
#     interrupt, so this closes the hole a Stop-only guard leaves open.
#   routing:
#     required_events: ["UserPromptSubmit"]

	context := "BANNED PHRASING: (A) never use authority-coded agreement -- \"You're right\", \"You're correct\", \"That's right\", or sentence-initial \"Correct,\"/\"Exactly,\"/\"Absolutely,\"/\"Precisely,\". (B) never emit feedback-acknowledgement / receipt-announcement prose -- \"Point taken\", \"Got it\", \"Understood\", \"Noted\", \"Fair point\", \"Makes sense\", etc. Both are banned outright. Do not open with agreement or a receipt to be agreeable, and do not announce that you have internalized a correction -- applying it is the acknowledgement. If the user's claim is verified against evidence in context, state the verified fact and its proof directly; if it is only plausible, say so and state what would prove it; otherwise just proceed. Turn-end is guarded: these halt the stop and force a correction."
