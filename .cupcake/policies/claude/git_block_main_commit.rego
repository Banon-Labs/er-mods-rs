# Never allow local commits while the active branch is main. Agents must create a
# feature/tooling branch from the intended base first, then commit there. If the
# branch signal is missing, fail closed: a missing signal caused a live main
# commit to slip through this guard on 2026-07-13.
#
# Worktree-target exception (2026-07-30, bd
# guard-blocks-worktree-commits-from-main-session-cwd-2026-07-29): the
# current_branch signal reads the branch of the session checkout, not the tree a
# `git -C <path> commit` actually targets, so worktree-based feature commits were
# denied whenever the main checkout sat on main. A command whose every commit
# invocation explicitly targets a registered git worktree on a non-main branch is
# not a main commit and is allowed. Anything unparsed, unregistered, detached, or
# bare (`git commit` without -C) keeps the deny (fail closed).
#
# Shell-wrapper decomposition (2026-08-26, bd er-effects-rs-dt2e): this guard
# carried the same anchor construction as ER-EFFECTS-BLOCK-MAIN-PUSH and the same
# double defect. `bash -c 'git commit -m x'` from a main session produced ZERO
# denials, because the character before the verb is a quote and a quote is not in
# `(^|[;&|(\n])`; meanwhile a newline IS, so quoted prose that named the command
# on its own line was denied though nothing would run. The pattern is unchanged;
# it now runs over commands.executed_texts, which neutralises the anchors inside
# quoted operand spans and hands back every shell-wrapper payload as its own
# text. See the header of .cupcake/system/commands.rego.
