# title: Block Manual pgrep in Agent Bash Commands (WSL false-negative guard)
# authors: ["er-quickload agents"]
# custom:
#   severity: HIGH
#   id: ER-EFFECTS-BLOCK-MANUAL-PGREP
#   description: >-
#     Hard block on agent-invoked `pgrep` inside Bash tool commands. On this WSL2 +
#     native-Windows-Steam box, `pgrep -x steam` (and pgrep for the game/EAC
#     processes, which are also Windows processes) is a FALSE NEGATIVE: those
#     processes are only visible via tasklist.exe, so pgrep reports "down" while
#     they are up. That false negative once blocked an entire overnight runtime
#     session. There is NO escape hatch for anything that could EXECUTE pgrep:
#     the only sanctioned pgrep lives INSIDE the committed helper
#     `scripts/steam-running.sh` (a file on disk, not an agent Bash command, so
#     it is never intercepted here). Steam checks must go through that helper;
#     any other process check must use tasklist.exe / a WSL-aware path. The
#     narrow non-executing exemptions cover TEXT positions only: a single,
#     non-chained bd issue-tracker command whose pgrep token sits entirely
#     inside quoted text (bd only records text; see bd er-effects-rs-uxyz), and
#     a single git commit whose token sits in the recorded MESSAGE (2026-08-12).
#     See bd steam-detection-wsl-false-negative-2026-07-18.

# A `pgrep` command token: at command start or after a shell separator
# (whitespace, `;`, `|`/`||`, `&`/`&&`, `(`/`$(`, a backtick, or a quote),
# optionally preceded by an absolute/relative path prefix (`/usr/bin/pgrep`,
# `./pgrep`), and terminated by a non-identifier char so
# `mypgrep`/`pgreptool`/`mypgreptool` never match (the token there is preceded
# or followed by an identifier char, not a delimiter). Quotes ARE delimiters so
# there is NO escape hatch: `bash -c 'pgrep ...'`, `sh -c "pgrep ..."`, and even a
# quoted subprocess arg like `subprocess.run(['pgrep', ...])` are all caught --
# a python subprocess pgrep is still raw Linux pgrep, not a WSL-aware check. The
# whole raw command is scanned (no quote scrubbing) so nothing can be smuggled
# past the guard inside quotes -- with ONE narrow non-executing exception, the
# bd issue-tracker text exemption below. The only sanctioned pgrep lives inside
# scripts/steam-running.sh (a file on disk, not an agent Bash command).

# bd issue-tracker text exemption (mirrors bash_elden_ring_launch_guard's
# bd_text_command).
#
# False positive fixed 2026-07-30 (bd er-effects-rs-uxyz): a `bd close` whose
# quoted --reason described launch-guard allow-tests was denied because the
# reason text mentioned the tool by name, e.g.
#
#   $HOME/.local/bin/bd close er-effects-rs-aaa --reason "launch-guard
#   allow-test keeps pgrep -x start_protected_game.exe detection green"
#
# Nothing executed pgrep -- the token appeared only inside quoted
# issue-tracker text. bd only records text, so for a single, non-chained Bash
# invocation of the real bd binary whose pgrep token sits entirely inside
# quoted text, the mention is documentation, not a process check.
#
# The exemption is deliberately narrow and fail-closed:
#   * Bash tool only, command starting with the bd binary (current-user-
#     agnostic path or bare `bd`) and a text-recording subcommand;
#   * the quote-scrubbed command must contain no separators, subshells,
#     redirects, or backticks (so no second command rides along);
#   * the raw command must contain no `$(` or backtick anywhere (command
#     substitution inside double quotes executes even though the quote scrub
#     removes it); and
#   * the pgrep token must NOT appear in the quote-scrubbed command -- an
#     unquoted pgrep anywhere keeps the guard on.
# A chained `bash -c '... bd close ... && bd close ...'` batch (the exact
# shape denied on 2026-07-29) does NOT get the exemption -- it is not a single
# bd invocation -- and stays denied by design; run bd invocations one at a
# time. Anything that could execute pgrep still has no escape hatch.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# git commit MESSAGE text exemption (mirrors bash_elden_ring_launch_guard's
# git_commit_text_command, which exists for the same class of false positive).
#
# False positive fixed 2026-08-12: a commit whose message PROSE described
# removing a raw process-name probe call from a shell script was denied --
#
#   git commit -F - <<'EOF'
#   preflight: stop probing the process table by name
#
#   The preflight called pgrep -x steam directly, which false-negatives on
#   this WSL2 + Windows-Steam box. It now sources scripts/steam-running.sh.
#   EOF
#
# Nothing executed the probe: git reads the message from stdin and records it.
# The agent worked around the denial by writing the message to a file and
# passing `git commit -F <path>`, which is an escape hatch around a guard --
# exactly the thing this repo treats as a defect rather than routine friction.
# A guard whose own removal cannot be described in the commit that removes it
# is unwritable in the repo that enforces it.
#
# Three message-carrying forms qualify, each already proven fail-closed in the
# launch guard, and each additionally requires that the token does NOT appear
# in the command's EXECUTABLE region (pgrep_commit_executable_region below):
#   * plain form: no heredoc, no `$(`, no backtick anywhere; the quote-scrubbed
#     command must be `git [-C <path>] add|commit ...` segments joined by `&&`
#     with no separators, subshells, redirects or unquoted newlines;
#   * `-m "$(cat <<'TAG' ... TAG )"` message substitution: exactly one `$(`,
#     immediately a `cat` reading a single quoted-tag heredoc, and the
#     whitespace-normalized command must end at the terminator followed by
#     exactly `)"`, so `cat` is the only command inside the substitution and
#     nothing rides after the message text;
#   * `-F -` heredoc: exactly one heredoc with a QUOTED tag (an unquoted tag
#     leaves the body subject to expansion, so its contents are not inert), the
#     region before it must be nothing but git add/commit ending in `-F -`, and
#     the terminator must be the LAST thing in the normalized command so no
#     trailing shell rides along.
# Anything chained, piped, substituted, wrapped in `bash -c`, or carrying a
# second heredoc fails the shape and stays denied. Nothing that could EXECUTE
# the probe gets an escape hatch: the exemption can only silence a mention that
# sits in the message git records.

On this WSL2 + native-Windows-Steam box manual pgrep is blocked because it FALSE-NEGATIVES: Steam runs as the Windows process steam.exe (and the game/EAC processes are Windows processes too), visible only via tasklist.exe, so `pgrep -x steam` reports 'down' while Steam is UP. That false negative once blocked an entire overnight runtime session. For a Steam check run `bash scripts/steam-running.sh` (the committed WSL-aware helper). For any OTHER process use tasklist.exe or a WSL-aware check, never raw pgrep. This guard has NO escape hatch for anything that could execute pgrep: the only sanctioned pgrep lives INSIDE scripts/steam-running.sh itself. (Narrow text exemptions: a single non-chained bd issue-tracker command may MENTION the token inside quoted text, and a single git commit may mention it in the recorded MESSAGE -- `-m \"...\"`, `-m \"$(cat <<'TAG' ... TAG )\"`, or `-F -` with a quoted-tag heredoc. Chained batches, `bash -c` wrappers, command substitution and anything after the heredoc terminator do not qualify -- run those invocations one at a time.)
