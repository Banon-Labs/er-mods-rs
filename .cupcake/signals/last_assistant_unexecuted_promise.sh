# Cupcake signal: last_assistant_unexecuted_promise
#
# Consumed by:
#   * no_unexecuted_promise (Stop): halts turn-end when the turn ENDED on a first-person promise to do
#     something, and nothing in the world is going to do it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (user directive 2026-08-22, in their words):
#   "How can I prevent you from ever saying 'I'll <statement of future action>' and then landing on no
#    shells running, no monitors, and no directive to me to explain why a user is required to
#    re-initiate the task."
# The instance: a turn ended "I'll re-record the directive with the shell metacharacters escaped
# rather than leave it unsaved" -- and then stopped. No tool call, no background task, no statement
# that the user had to do anything. The work evaporated and the user had to notice and re-ask. Prose
# promises are unenforceable by prose; only a Stop hook that refuses the stop closes this.
#
# THE VIOLATION IS THE CONJUNCTION OF FOUR FACTS. All four must hold, and any one missing is fine:
#   1. the turn's FINAL prose block contains a first-person commitment to a CONCRETE action
#      ("I'll re-run the gate", "I'm going to patch it", "let me check the offsets", and -- the shape
#      that walked through the guard on 2026-09-01 -- the bare present continuous "I'm closing it");
#   2. no tool_use follows that prose in the turn -- nothing executed it;
#   3. nothing is carrying it: no watcher (detached shell / Monitor / SendMessage) in the turn, and
#      no live background job that the promise actually WAITS ON ("once it lands", "whatever it
#      finds"). A live job the promise never mentions is not cover -- a game session the user is
#      inspecting can be up for an hour, and the promise is deferred behind it, not carried by it;
#   4. the message does not hand the obligation to the user -- no question, no blocker statement, no
#      "once you've X", no "I'll need you to Y", no "next session".
# Emitted as  PROMISE:<the offending clause>  ; empty when the turn is clean.
#
# BIASED HARD TOWARD NOT FIRING, on purpose. A guard that cries wolf gets ignored, which is worse than
# no guard. Three deliberate narrowings:
#   * only the FINAL prose block is scanned. A mid-turn "I'll check the disassembly" that is followed
#     by the tool call doing exactly that is the normal, correct shape and must never be touched.
#   * the committed verb must be on a CONCRETE-ACTION allowlist. Stance and mental verbs ("I'll keep
#     that in mind", "I'll treat it as unproven"), verbs the same message already fulfils ("I'll
#     summarise", "I'll explain"), hedges ("I'll try to", "I'll probably") and negations ("I'll never")
#     are not promises of work and are all excluded.
#   * quoted spans, backticked spans and fenced code are stripped before matching, so quoting the ban
#     -- this file, the policy text, a test fixture -- cannot trip it.
#
# The shared half of the classification (turn bucketing, substantive-work vs status-peek, the
# blocked-on-user phrasing, live background work) is NOT reimplemented here: it comes from
# scripts/cupcake_turn_scan.py, the same module last_assistant_idle_hold.sh uses, so the two guards
# cannot drift into disagreeing about the same turn. Fail-open (empty output) on any error.

# --- (1) first-person future commitment --------------------------------------------------------
# The openers an assistant actually uses to commit itself. "let's" is deliberately absent: it
# proposes joint action rather than committing the agent.
#
# THE BARE PRESENT CONTINUOUS ("I'm closing it") IS LAST, AND IT IS NOT COSMETIC. The guard shipped
# without it and a turn walked straight through the hole: "I'm closing it rather than pushing an
# empty merge commit to make an empty PR green" -- no `gh pr close` ran, the PR stayed open, and the
# user had to notice and ask. Because the opener never matched, the other three facts were never even
# evaluated. Present continuous is the MORE seductive way to make an unkept promise than "I'll",
# precisely because it reads to a human as already underway.
#
# ORDER MATTERS. Python alternation takes the FIRST alternative that matches at a position, not the
# longest, so the bare form must come after "i'm going to" / "i'm about to" -- ahead of them it would
# swallow their prefix and hand `committed_verb` the word "going", which is deliberately not an
# action. Everything that keeps this narrow lives in `committed_verb`: the next non-filler word must
# be the -ING form of a verb already on the concrete-action allowlist, so the stative uses this
# repo's prose is full of ("I'm treating that as unproven", "I'm reporting it rather than fixing it",
# "I'm not sure", "I'm quoting the failure below") resolve to no action verb and stay silent.
