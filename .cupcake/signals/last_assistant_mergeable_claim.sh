# Cupcake signal: last_assistant_mergeable_claim
#
# Consumed by:
#   * no_mergeable_without_green_ci (Stop): halts a turn that closed by calling the pull request
#     mergeable while CI is not passing.
#
# Why this exists
#
# 2026-09-11. A turn closed "PR #426 is **MERGEABLE** now -- the conflicts are gone." while the
# `check` job was `in_progress` and had never passed on that branch. `gh pr view` had also printed
# `mergeStateStatus = BLOCKED` in the same command's output -- GitHub saying the merge button is
# disabled -- and that was read past. The user's words: "gh cli says its mergable. That doesn't
# mean it is."
#
# `mergeable` is GitHub's three-way merge result: does the branch apply to the base without a
# textual conflict. It is computed from trees and knows nothing about builds, tests, or whether a
# required check has started.
#
# What it emits
#
#   MERGEABLECLAIM:<claimed>:<verdict>
#
# claimed is 1 when the turn's closing prose called the pull request mergeable, 0 otherwise.
# verdict is the measured CI state for the current branch -- `PASS` / `PENDING` / `FAIL` / `NOPR` /
# `UNKNOWN`
# -- computed the same way ci_state_for_branch computes it. Nothing is emitted when the transcript
# cannot be read, so an absent signal asserts nothing.
