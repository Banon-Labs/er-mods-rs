# Cupcake signal: last_assistant_fix_claim_without_runtime_evidence
#
# Scans the most recently completed assistant turn and emits one facts line when that turn changed
# code that ships inside the game, called the change a fix, and never opened anything a run wrote:
#
#   FIXFACTS|claim=..|changed=..|evidence=..|hedged=..|blocked=..|hostobject=..
#
# A clean turn emits nothing (fail-open, like every neighbouring signal).
#
# The failure this exists to refuse
# ---------------------------------
# User, 2026-09-11: "If someone ever says real fix to me and doesn't put it in airquotes, I look at
# them like this" -- and then, when nothing had stopped it: "We are supposed to have a rego policy
# that stops you from saying 'fix' without runtime evidence". The turn had edited a crate that ships
# inside a loaded DLL, built it, never launched the game, and closed on "the real fix". It failed
# live on the next launch, which is the cost the word had already spent.
#
# What counts as runtime evidence, and what does not
#   counts     -- the turn opened something a run of the game produced, at or after the edit: an
#                 `er-<name>.log` written by a loaded DLL, an `er-<name>telemetry<name>.json`, one
#                 of the streamed `er-<name>.jsonl` records, a path under the `er-me3-runs` run
#                 root, a `br-<date>-<time>-<id>` run id, a named `oracle_<field>`, a live read
#                 through `scripts/er-live-fields.py`, `scripts/er-teardown.py --status`,
#                 `scripts/er-readiness-watch.py`, or `scripts/er-frida-watch.py`.
#   never       -- a build, however green. `cargo xwin build`, `cargo test`, `cargo check`,
#                 `scripts/er-build-dlls.sh` and a `sha256sum` of the artifact all say the code
#                 compiles. A launch says the game starts: `scripts/er-run-branch.py` and
#                 `~/Elden/launch.sh` are not in the allowlist either, because a process appearing
#                 is not a behaviour being observed.
#   never       -- arming a watch on one, which is the 2026-09-13 miss. A `Monitor`, a
#                 `run_in_background` call, and a `tail -f`/`nohup`/`setsid` command all name the
#                 artifact and have read none of it. That turn closed on "Fixed and relaunched as
#                 07f2729b" with its last call a `Monitor` on `tail -F
#                 er-quickload-autoload-debug.log` -- a log the process it had just started had not
#                 written a line of -- and the filename inside the tool input read as evidence. The
#                 same exclusion applies to the prose: "the monitor will tell me if `muted=true`
#                 appears" is the promise of a measurement, not one.
#
# Ordering is half the rule. Evidence counts only from the first edit onward, because a log read
# before the change describes the code that was there before it. Measured from the first such edit
# rather than the last, so a turn that reads the log and then makes one more small edit still counts
# as having looked -- the lenient reading of a rule whose false positive gags an honest report. The
# one place the anchor does move forward is a rebuild: a measurement taken before the artifact was
# built again describes the previous artifact, and the claim is about the one that is loaded now.
# A `cargo check` or a test run produces no artifact and moves nothing.
#
# The exemptions, each a case where the word is being used honestly
#   hedged     -- the closing prose says somewhere that the change is unverified, untested, has not
#                 run, needs a run, or is ready for the next one. An honest hedge is the behaviour
#                 being asked for and must never be punished. Scanned over the whole closing run,
#                 not the matched sentence, so a claim in one paragraph and its hedge in the next
#                 still passes.
#   blocked    -- a dependency the agent cannot dissolve: sudo, a credential, an observation only
#                 the user can make, or a decision handed back to them.
#   hostobject -- the sentence says a gate, a check, a test or a lint was fixed and names nothing
#                 that lives inside the game. A green gate is the proof of host work, and demanding
#                 a game launch for a clippy lint is how a guard earns a reputation for being wrong.
#   changed=0  -- the turn edited no crate that can reach a DLL. Host work under `scripts/`, `docs/`
#                 or `.cupcake/`, and the two host-only crate directories, are all outside the rule:
#                 a run cannot show any of them working or failing.
#
# Why the neighbouring Stop guards do not catch it
#   * `last_assistant_proof_without_observation` reads one word, `proven`, measured against the
#     corpus. A turn that says "the real fix" never says "proven", which is the whole reason the
#     stronger word gets avoided.
#   * `last_assistant_unbacked_claim` asks whether an artifact the turn claims to have built exists.
#     Here it does exist -- the edit was real, and only the claim about its effect is unbacked.
#   * `last_assistant_diagnosis_without_fix` turns on whether a file changed. One did.
#   * `git_require_runtime_evidence` gates `git push`, not prose, so a turn that says it and never
#     pushes is invisible to it.
#
# Fenced code, backtick spans and double-quoted spans are stripped before matching, so quoting this
# file, the policy, or the user's own words cannot trip it -- and a scare-quoted "fix" stops being a
# claim for free, which is the airquotes the directive asks for. The shared half (transcript
# discovery, turn bucketing, prose runs) comes from `scripts/cupcake_turn_scan.py` and the
# classification from `scripts/cupcake_fix_claim.py`, so the guards cannot drift into disagreeing
# about the same turn. Fail-open (empty output) on any error.
#
# Measured before it shipped, and re-measured 2026-09-13 after the widening, over the real closing
# turns in ~/.claude/projects/-home-banon-projects-er-mods-rs*/*.jsonl. Now: 2,820 closing turns,
# 299 of them call something a fix, three halt -- the hook change this rule shipped for, and two
# from the session that prompted the widening. The first pass of that widening halted five, and the
# two it should not have are pinned as negatives in `scripts/test-fix-claim-classifier.py`: a turn
# that said "This build doesn't fix that case -- it makes it legible", and one that settled a
# compile against a pinned upstream revision. Both corrections were made to the vocabulary rather
# than to the conjunction, and re-measured rather than argued.
