# Cupcake signal: last_assistant_unbacked_claim
#
# Consumed by:
#   * no_unbacked_claim (Stop): halts turn-end when the closing prose CLAIMS an artifact was
#     built/changed and nothing in the turn wrote a file.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (user, 2026-08-23). The turn opened "Build a conformance gate, because 'read the
# reference first' is a note and notes are advisory", described a `reference-implementations.toml`
# and a check in check.sh -- and shipped a `bd remember` call and nothing else. No gate. No file.
# The user's reply: "You didn't. You recorded a beads memory. That ABSOLUTELY IS NOT EVEN REMOTELY
# CLOSE to a conformance GATE." A memory costs one tool call and FEELS like delivery, which is
# exactly why it substitutes for delivery.
#
# SIBLING, NOT DUPLICATE, of last_assistant_unexecuted_promise. That one catches the FUTURE tense
# ("I'll build it") ending in nothing. This one catches the PAST/PERFECT tense ("I built it",
# "I've wired it in", "I added the check") when nothing was built. Opposite failure, same hole.
#
# THE VIOLATION IS A CONJUNCTION OF THREE FACTS. Any one missing and the signal stays silent:
#   1. the FINAL prose block contains a first-person COMPLETION claim -- "I built/added/created/
#      wrote/wired/landed/shipped/implemented/patched/updated/removed <x>";
#   2. the claim's object is a REPO ARTIFACT: a path-like token (scripts/..., crates/..., *.py,
#      *.rego, *.rs, *.toml, *.sh) or one of gate/check/hook/policy/test/script/guard/selftest;
#   3. NOTHING IN THE TURN WROTE A FILE -- no Edit/Write/NotebookEdit tool_use, and no Bash call
#      carrying a write construct (redirect, tee, sed -i, heredoc-to-python, cp/mv/install, patch,
#      git apply). A `bd remember` on its own is explicitly NOT a write: it is the substitution
#      this guard exists to catch.
#
# BIASED HARD TOWARD NOT FIRING, like its sibling -- a guard that cries wolf gets ignored.
#   * only the FINAL prose block is scanned;
#   * quoted, backticked and fenced spans are stripped first, so quoting this file, the policy, or
#     a test fixture cannot trip it;
#   * negations and disclaimers are honoured: "I have not built it", "no gate exists", "I did not
#     write", "nothing was created" SUPPRESS the hit outright -- an honest confession of absence
#     is the behaviour being asked for, and must never be punished;
#   * a claim about the GAME, a run, or an external thing ("the DLL loaded", "the import granted
#     129 items") is not a repo-artifact claim and is not matched.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CATCH, stated so nobody mistakes its silence for proof: an
# IMPERATIVE recommendation that reads as delivered ("Build a conformance gate.") has no first-
# person verb and will pass. Matching bare imperatives would fire on every legitimate
# recommendation, which would make the guard noise. That gap is real and is not closed here.
#
# Emitted as  UNBACKED:<the offending clause>  ; empty when the turn is clean. Fail-open on error.
