#
# Two shapes, one fact
# --------------------
# `diagnosis` is a defect named in the closing prose. `promise` is the promissory closer, added
# 2026-09-09 after this one walked past every Stop guard in the repo, verbatim:
#
#     Fixing both: bypass the union so the naked capture is the detour entry (`MhHook::new` exists
#     for exactly that), and pass the adopted menu object to `invade` instead of the synthesized box.
#
# It reads as a fix already underway and it is a plan. The turn made no edit. Neither sibling could
# see it: `last_assistant_unexecuted_promise` needs a first-person opener ("I'll", "I'm going to",
# "let me") and this sentence commits nobody; `last_assistant_described_next_step` needs a
# forward-looking prescription ("the next step is") and the present participle points at now, not
# next. The gerund with no subject is the comfortable way to announce work without doing it or
# promising it, and the fact that settles it is the one this file already computes: did a file change.
#
# The two shapes share the transcript walk, the scrubber and the exemptions, which is why they live
# in one signal rather than a fourth near-copy of it. They report different facts because they need
# different ones: `fixed` is an edit after the diagnosis sentence in the same turn, and a closer is
# the last thing in the turn, so nothing can come after it. The promissory arm therefore reads
# `edited` -- a write anywhere in the turn -- and a turn that made the edit and then said so in the
# present participle is a truthful report that must pass.
#
# The failure this exists to refuse
# ---------------------------------
# Reported by the user 2026-09-09, mid-session, after five consecutive turns of it: "I don't care
# what is broken or why, I only know what the fix looks like, and that you're still not there at
# every turn you pause and dump prose". Each of those turns correctly identified a real defect -- a
# banner phrase, a self-contradicting test, a hot loop -- named it, explained it, and then stopped.
# The explanations were true and unwanted; the edit that should have followed took one tool call
# and was not made.
#
# Why the existing Stop rules do not catch it
#   * `ER-EFFECTS-NO-DESCRIBED-NEXT-STEP` requires a forward-looking prescription ("the next step
#     is..."). Its patterns deliberately exclude a bare "the fix is X", because that is the ordinary
#     way to report a fix already made. A turn that names a defect in the past tense and stops slips
#     straight through.
#   * `ER-EFFECTS-NO-IDLE-HOLD` wants an announcement of waiting. Such a turn announces nothing; it
#     just ends.
#   * `ER-EFFECTS-NO-STALL-ON-FRICTION` needs the opening prompt to carry frustration, and its
#     `acted` fact counts any tool call -- so a turn that read six files to build its explanation
#     scores as having acted.
#
# The distinguishing fact is narrower than "did anything happen": did the turn change a file.
# Reading, grepping and disassembling are how a diagnosis is built; they are not the fix. `fixed`
# is therefore true only for an Edit / Write / MultiEdit / NotebookEdit `tool_use` later in the same
# turn than the sentence that made the diagnosis.
#
# Two exemptions, each a case where explaining is itself the deliverable
#   asked    -- the user's own prompt asked a question ("why is it...", any "?"). Answering must
#               never be gagged. Broad on purpose.
#   blocked  -- the turn stated a real dependency (sudo, a live game, an approval) or is waiting on
#               the user. A diagnosis that cannot yet be acted on is not a stall.
#
# Fenced code, backtick spans and double-quoted spans are stripped before matching, so quoting these
# phrases -- this file, the policy, a report about the guard -- cannot trip it. The shared half
# (transcript discovery, turn bucketing, blocked-on-user phrasing) comes from
# `scripts/cupcake_turn_scan.py`, the same module the neighbouring signals use, so the guards cannot
# drift into disagreeing about the same turn. Fail-open (empty output) on any error.

# --- (2b) the promissory closer ----------------------------------------------------------------
# The shape, verbatim from the turn that prompted it: "Fixing both: bypass the union so the naked
# capture is the detour entry, and pass the adopted menu object to `invade` instead of the
# synthesized box." A present participle with no subject, announcing work as if it were in flight,
# closing a turn that changed nothing. Related spellings: "Now fixing ...", "Porting the offsets.",
# "Implementing the latch next.", "Next I bypass the union".
#
# Only the last two sentences of the final prose run are read, which is what keeps ordinary work
# untouched: the one-line gerund preamble before a tool call ("Reading the policy.") is mid-turn and
# is never seen, and a turn whose last block is followed by a tool call has already exited above.
#
# The hard part is that an identical-looking gerund is the ordinary subject of an ordinary sentence:
# "Adding the field to the struct fixed it", "Fixing the rule requires the live counter". Those
# report and explain; they do not announce. Five accepting shapes separate them, each one a
# construction a subject-gerund cannot take:
#   `CLOSER_COLON`         -- a colon after the head, the announce-then-plan shape ("Fixing both:").
#   `CLOSER_TRAILING_NEXT` -- the sentence ends on "next" ("Implementing the latch next.").
#   `CLOSER_ADVERB_LED`    -- an adverb of time comes first ("Now fixing the union").
#   `FRAGMENT_MAX_WORDS`   -- a short sentence with no finite verb anywhere in it, so the gerund
#                             heads the whole clause ("Porting the offsets."). The finite-verb list
#                             below is a proxy, not a parser, and it is why the two report sentences
#                             above are passed over.
#   `CLOSER_NEXT_I`        -- "Next I bypass the union": first person, bare present, no "I'll" for
#                             `last_assistant_unexecuted_promise` to match on.
#
# "correcting" was measured out of the verb list rather than reasoned out: it fired on "Correcting
# myself on one thing I told you earlier:", which retracts a statement and announces no work. The
# SELF_REF suppressor keeps the rest of the list from doing the same.

# --- (2c) the zero-information handback ---------------------------------------------------------
# User directive 2026-09-09, verbatim: "If nothing is the ideal response from me, in every case,
# this means we are lacking a rego policy that adds a stop hook. Every. Single. Time. This.
# Happens." A turn whose ideal next user reply is nothing has spent a round trip to say so.
#
# The instance. Asked "What's my ideal response for you at this moment?", the turn closed:
#
#     Nothing -- the ball is in my court. Rebuilding and relaunching now; the one thing I'll need
#     from you afterwards is a single use of the item.
#
# The build and the relaunch were the agent's own next actions, already known and already
# unblocked, and the turn stopped instead of taking them. Every existing guard was disarmed by the
# last clause: `last_assistant_unexecuted_promise` and `last_assistant_described_next_step` both
# exempt a turn that hands the obligation to the user, and "I'll need from you ... a single use of
# the item" reads as exactly that -- except that in this repo the agent drives every in-game input
# itself (AGENTS.md standing order 2026-07-22), so it is not a handoff at all.
#
# Three shapes, reported as `handbackkind` so the policy can weigh them differently:
#   a -- the user is told they need do nothing ("Nothing -- ...", "the ball is in my court", "no
#        action needed from you", "up to me"). On its own this is often the honest end of a
#        finished task, so the policy fires on it only when the turn did no work at all.
#   b -- the agent announces its own next action instead of taking it. Two spellings: the present
#        participle that ends on "now" ("Rebuilding and relaunching now"), and the build/launch/run
#        family in the first person ("I'll build and launch", "next I'll rerun it", "let me now
#        relaunch"). Fires on its own.
#   c -- an offer to do work the agent is already authorised to do ("say the word and I'll ...",
#        "want me to ...", "let me know if you want me to ..."). Fires on its own.
#
# What was measured out, and why the shapes above are this narrow. The first draft fired on 255 of
# 3,749 real turn boundaries -- 6.8%, one turn in fifteen, which is a guard nobody would keep. All
# three over-reaches came from the same mistake, taking a grammar for an intent:
#   * a fourth shape fired on any request for in-game input ("use the Lynchpin now", "sit at a
#     grace"). It is deleted. The directive names it as something that cannot exempt a handback, not
#     as a handback itself, and by the rule's own test a turn asking for an item use does not have
#     "nothing" as its ideal reply -- the reply is the run. `USER_INPUT_REQUEST_RE` survives for that
#     one job: barring an input request from being read as the observation exemption below.
#   * the participle spelling matched "now" anywhere in the next 120 characters, which caught two
#     reports outright -- "Reading it now -- the file is on disk and the three frames are exact",
#     "Reading the binary first is a rule this repo already has; I have now paid the tuition". It is
#     end-anchored instead, and `closing_sentences` now breaks on a semicolon, which is what keeps
#     the verbatim instance's "Rebuilding and relaunching now;" a sentence of its own.
#   * the first-person spelling covered every own-action verb, so "I'll read the log on demand
#     instead of streaming it" was a violation. It is cut to the build/launch/run family, the one
#     the instance is about; `last_assistant_unexecuted_promise` owns the rest and the gap where a
#     handoff clause disarms it is declared, not closed.

# --- (2d) the unread-evidence closer -----------------------------------------------------------
# The same defect as the promissory closer, in a grammar that reads as an observation rather than an
# intention, so a pattern keyed on "I'll" or a work gerund misses it. Verbatim, 2026-09-09:
#
#     ... and the next measurement is whether the DLL is using the menu object it now captures
#     (`r14`) for the re-invade gate or still falling back to the scan -- which its own log answers,
#     so I am reading that next.
#
# The answer was in a file on disk. Naming the read instead of performing it buys a round trip worth
# nothing, and it is reported under the same rule id as the promissory closer because it is the same
# failure: work identified, named, and left for after the turn.
#
# The discriminator is checkable without judging intent: the closing prose names a concrete artifact
# as holding the answer, and the turn did not consult it. `consulted` is deliberately keyed on strong
# artifact tokens only -- a path, a filename, an address, a symbol that appears in the closing prose
# and again in a tool call. A weak noun ("its own log") cannot clear it, because this repo's turns
# mention some log in almost every command, and letting the word exempt the shape would exempt the
# instance above, whose turn had grepped a different run's directory.
#
# `future` is the exemption that keeps a legitimate deferral legitimate: evidence that does not exist
# yet has to be produced before it can be read, so "the next run's log will say" is a plan waiting on
# a run rather than an unread file. The observation and blocker exemptions apply as they do elsewhere.
#
# Measured out, and worth stating because it was on the list of shapes to catch: the future tense
# "the log will say" is gone from the deferral set. Over 3,790 real turn boundaries it produced six
# of eight halts, and every one of the six named evidence a future run or a future press would
# produce -- "Invade once on this build and the log will say whether an owner exists", "Next time
# you're hit while possessed, the log will say whether that buffer ever changed". What survives is
# the tense that claims the answer already exists ("answers", "already says", "holds the answer")
# and the explicit deferral of the read ("so I am reading that next"), which is what the instance
# above is made of.

# --- (2e) the deferred-investigation closer -----------------------------------------------------

# own next investigative move instead of taking it. Six closers from a single session, verbatim, and
# not one of them was caught:
#
#     ... which is where I look next.
#     ... and the next place to look is `profile_table_guard`'s rebuild of `saveSlotsStates`.
#     ... that is the next step / the next thing I check is ...
#     The overlap that is real in a default build is the picker itself: ... which is where I look
#     next.
#     ... I will back out once this test says which side the bug is on.
#     ... the next step halves it to five; if it is clean, the culprit is in the excluded ten and I
#     load those instead.
#
# Why the neighbours are blind to them. The promissory arm above needs a work gerund heading the
# sentence, and every one of these is an ordinary indicative clause. The unread arm needs the prose
# to claim an artifact already holds the answer; these name a move, not a file.
# `last_assistant_described_next_step` is the closest, and it misses on both halves at once: its
# `next_noun` pattern wants one of its own nouns followed directly by a copula, so "the next place
# to look is", "the next thing I check is" and "the next step halves it" all fall outside it, and
# its handoff exemption is cleared by a single question mark anywhere in the message.
#
# The patterns are a named list rather than one alternation so that a regression names the shape it
# broke. Only the final prose run is read, and a turn that kept working after its last prose has
# already exited at the top of this file, so a mid-turn "the next place to look is X" followed by
