# Cupcake signal: runtime_evidence_for_head
#
# Consumed by:
#   * git_require_runtime_evidence (PreToolUse/Bash): refuses `git push` when the commits being
#     pushed change code that runs inside ELDEN RING and no run has produced evidence since.
#
# Why this exists
#
# 2026-09-09: two commits were authored and a push attempted for both -- an F3 key that had never
# been pressed in the game, and a stall-watchdog fix whose code had never executed, because the DLL
# in the running process had been built before either. The user stopped the push and asked for this
# guard by name. AGENTS.md already says to commit only after a runtime validation run completes;
# that rule is prose, and prose did not stop it. This does.
#
# What it emits, one line, one word:
#
#   `OK`         a run executed this code: a DLL log names the tip on its own `build git=` line,
#                or names a commit the tip adds no cargo work on top of.
#   `MISSING`    no run did. This is the case that denies.
#   `NOTRUNTIME` the commits about to be pushed touch no crate that ships in a DLL, so there is
#                nothing for a run to prove. Never denies.
#   `UNKNOWN`    the signal could not measure (no git, no log directory, unreadable). Never denies:
#                a guard that cannot see must not invent a verdict, and the pre-push hook plus
#                CI still stand behind it.
#
# One word with no fields, because the parsing is easier to selftest in bash than in rego, and the
# prose belongs to the sibling signal `runtime_evidence_note`, which the policy interpolates but
# never inspects. The header used to justify this differently -- that every parsing form tried in
# rego was inert -- and that was wrong: the policy was dead because of `sprintf`, which cupcake's
# WASM runtime does not implement, not because of anything to do with parsing or `input.signals`.
#
# Which logs count, and what a `+dirty` line means, is decided in one place for all three readers
# of this evidence: `scripts/er-runtime-evidence.py`. It reads the run root and the game directory
# both -- a run launched through `~/Elden/launch.sh` writes only into the second, and reading only
# the first refused a push on 2026-09-11 that a live run had proven. Its header carries the rest.
#
# Which repository is being pushed is decided by `scripts/cupcake_push_target_repo.py`, and it is
# not always the one this process starts in. Measured 2026-09-13: a session working in the main
# checkout ran `cd <another worktree> && git push ...`, and every git read below answered about the
# main checkout -- tip `0f309fd6` -- while the commit going out was `6271ceb5` in that other
# worktree, whose diff against `origin/main` touches no crate at all. The push was refused on a
# measurement of a repository it was not about. The same mix-up runs the other way and is worse:
# a push of unproven game code from one working tree passes whenever the directory this process
# happens to sit in has evidence of its own, which is the exact push this guard exists to stop.
# Cupcake pipes the whole pending event to every signal on stdin, so the command is readable here
# and the git reads can move to the checkout it names.
#
# What decides the answer is the sha in the log, never a timestamp. The first version compared
# mtimes and answered `OK` on a log written by a build two commits old that happened to still be
# running -- newer file, older code -- which is the exact failure being guarded, made inside the
# guard.
#
# Safe to run on every Bash call, and measured rather than asserted: ~0.1s warm, ~1.2s the first
# time a new tip is seen, no network. It writes nothing but its own memo under `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`.
# The version that read the whole run root and walked the reverse-dependency graph once per log
# line took over 45 seconds, which one gate then paid 176 times.

# No log names this commit, but a run may still have executed the same code. The tip proves out

# the next agent overrides by reflex.
#
# scripts/er-change-scope.py answers it, the same reverse-dependency walk the compile gate uses:
# `--rust-touched` exits 3 for "provably no cargo work required" and 0 otherwise, and it fails open
# on a git failure, an unresolvable base, or any build input outside a single crate directory. So it
# can only forgive a diff that provably cannot change a DLL. It agrees with
# scripts/check-runtime-evidence.sh by construction: two enforcement points that answer differently
# about one push teach the next agent to ignore whichever is louder.
#
# Deduplicated and capped by the scanner, which the pre-push copy does not need to be. This signal
# runs on every single Bash tool call, and every attempt is a whole reverse-dependency walk: the
# first version tried one per matching log line, and the run root here holds hundreds of them across
# a dozen builds. It took over 45 seconds to answer, on a signal whose header promises three git
# reads and a stat. The newest builds are the only ones a live branch can carry forward from anyway
# -- an older sha reaches the tip across strictly more commits, so if the newest cannot forgive the
# diff, an older one cannot either.
# Memoised, because one gate charges this signal 176 times. `scripts/test-cupcake-policies.py`
# drives that many `cupcake eval` spawns and every one of them runs every signal, so a walk that
# costs half a second lands as minutes on the suite. The answer is a pure function of the two
# commit shas -- `--rev` reads the commit, not the working tree -- so it is safe to keep, and it is
# keyed by both shas so it cannot be served for a different pair.
# The candidate lines go in as an argument rather than on stdin: the heredoc below is itself the
# program, so a pipe into it would be swallowed (shellcheck SC2259) and every carry-forward would
# quietly find no candidates at all.
#
# No `-C` down here, and that is not an oversight. Everything below is driven by the two shas, and
# `cupcake_push_target_repo.py` only ever names a working tree of this same repository -- one
# object store, shared by every working tree of it -- so `git diff <built>..<tip>` reads the same
# commits from either directory. The reads that could not be answered from here are the ones that
# depend on which tree is checked out (`HEAD`, and the diff against `origin/main`), and those are
# the ones that moved.
