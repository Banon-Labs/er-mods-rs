# Has a Frida session actually observed something since the last commit?
#
# Read by `.cupcake/policies/claude/no_rust_edit_without_frida_proof.rego`, which refuses a Rust
# edit under `crates/` until this prints `PROVEN`. The judgement lives in
# `scripts/er-frida-evidence.py --check`, not here, so the rule and its selftest are one thing.
#
# Fails closed, unlike the other signals in this directory. Printing nothing means the policy sees
# no proof and denies, which is the whole point: a broken evidence reader must not quietly hand out
# permission to edit. `live_er_run.sh` fails open because its absence means "no run to protect";
# absence here means "no measurement was taken".
