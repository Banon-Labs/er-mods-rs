# Cupcake signal: last_assistant_idle_hold
#
# Scans the most recently COMPLETED assistant turn of the current session transcript and returns a
# TAGGED idle-hold marker, or empty if the turn is clean. Consumed by TWO policies:
#   * idle_hold (Stop): halts turn-end so the agent does non-overlapping work or justifies the wait.
#   * idle_hold_reminder (UserPromptSubmit): standing reminder + interlock backstop (catches an
#     interrupted turn the Stop halt could not see).
#
# BANNED CLASS (persistent user directive 2026-07-17, recurring anti-pattern):
#   The agent announces it is IDLING / HOLDING / STANDING BY while a background task runs, WITHOUT
#   justification. Phrases like "I'm holding", "holding for", "holding off", "standing by",
#   "I'll wait for", "waiting for X before", "waiting on X rather than", "nothing to do but wait",
#   "I'll pause here", "let it run and wait". Emitted as  IDLEHOLD:<phrase>.
#
# TWO EXEMPTIONS suppress the flag (the turn is NOT idle -- it is either productive or justified):
#   (a) JUSTIFICATION PROSE -- the same turn contains "I would normally have <...> but <...>" /
#       "normally I'd <...> however <...>": the agent acknowledges non-overlapping work exists and
#       states a reason it could not be done. The user can validate that, so it is allowed.
#   (b) SUBSTANTIVE WORK -- the same turn contains a substantive tool_use: an Edit/Write/Agent
#       tool_use, or a Bash command that is NOT a pure status/log peek. A turn whose only Bash calls
#       are tail/cat/head/wc/grep/echo/ls of a log/output file is a "status peek" and does NOT count
#       as substantive (so "holding" + only peeking still flags).
#
# One further carve-out inside the phrase match: a wait that is legitimately BLOCKED ON THE USER
# ("waiting for user confirmation", "holding for the user to drive", "I'll wait for you") is NOT
# idling -- the agent genuinely cannot proceed -- so those are excluded from the phrase hit.
#
# TIGHTENED RULE (persistent user directive 2026-07-17): a blocked-pause message must be TERSE. When a
# turn ends as a PURE PAUSE (no substantive tool_use) that is NOT blocked on the user, and its message
# is LONG / multi-topic (>450 chars, OR >3 sentences, OR any heading/bullet/numbered line, OR more than
# one paragraph), the signal emits  VERBOSEPAUSE:<n-chars>  instead of IDLEHOLD. This closes the gap
# where the idle-hold rule accepted a long "justified" hold: a genuinely blocked pause must be ONLY a
# short, precise statement of what it is blocked on -- no status summaries, findings recaps, plans, or
# next-step narration. VERBOSEPAUSE takes precedence over IDLEHOLD and fires even when justification
# prose is present (that verbose justified hold is exactly what the new rule bans). A turn that did
# substantive work, or one genuinely blocked on the USER, is exempt.
#
# WHY A WHOLE-TURN SCAN + BOTH EVENTS: mirrors last_assistant_authority_agreement -- an early-message
# slip must not be masked by a later clean block (whole-turn scan), and an INTERRUPTED turn fires no
# Stop event, so the same signal is routed into the UserPromptSubmit interlock which always runs.
# "Last completed turn" = the last non-empty run of assistant text bounded by real user prompts;
# tool-result carrier "user" events do NOT split a turn.
#
# Double-quoted spans are stripped before prose matching so quoting the ban (this file, the reminder
# text, or a meta-discussion like the phrase "I'm holding") does not false-trip; a real unquoted
# announcement still matches. Fail-open (empty output) on any error so a transcript hiccup cannot
# wedge the session.

# fine; a verbose justified hold is now a violation. A wait genuinely blocked on the USER (awaiting
# their answer/drive) is exempt, as is any turn that did substantive work. Emitted as VERBOSEPAUSE:<n>
# (n = char count of the message). VERBOSEPAUSE takes precedence over IDLEHOLD (its "be terse"
# guidance is the more specific correction, and it must fire even when a justification paragraph is
# present -- that is exactly the long "justified" hold the new rule bans).
