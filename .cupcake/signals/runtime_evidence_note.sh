# Cupcake signal: runtime_evidence_note
#
# Consumed by:
#   * git_require_runtime_evidence (PreToolUse/Bash): refuses `git push` when the commits being
#     pushed change code that runs inside ELDEN RING and no run has produced evidence since.
#
# Why this exists
#
# 2026-09-09: two commits were authored and a push attempted for both -- an F3 key that had never
# been pressed in the game, and a stall-watchdog fix whose code had never executed, because the DLL
# in the running process had been built before either. The user stopped the push and asked for this
# guard by name. AGENTS.md already says to commit only after a runtime validation run completes;
# that rule is prose, and prose did not stop it. This does.
#
# What it emits, one line:
#
#   one line of prose naming what ran, for the denial message. Never branched on.
#
# The verdict lives in the sibling signal `runtime_evidence_for_head`, which emits one of
# `OK`, `MISSING`, `NOTRUNTIME` or `UNKNOWN`. Splitting them keeps every comparison in the policy a
# string equality against a word, and leaves the sentence a human reads free to change without
# touching a rule.
#
# Both signals now read `scripts/er-runtime-evidence.py`, which is the point: this file used to
# carry its own scan, and the two could disagree about which log the verdict came from. On
# 2026-09-11 a refusal named `er-quickload-autoload-debug.log` as "built from a DIRTY tree" -- the
# newest file by mtime, written by a module the sentence never mentioned -- and the agent reading
# it went hunting the wrong log. The sentence now names the module as well as the file, and comes
# from the same scan that produced the verdict.
#
# What decides the answer is the sha a DLL log names on its own `build git=` line, never a
# timestamp. The first version compared mtimes and answered `OK` on a log written by a build two
# commits old that happened to still be running -- newer file, older code -- which is the exact
# failure being guarded, made inside the guard.
#
# Safe to run on every Bash call: three git reads and a bounded directory scan, no network, no
# writes.
set -uo pipefail

# The regression tests drive the policy through this, the same way the branch guards use
# CUPCAKE_CURRENT_BRANCH_OVERRIDE.

# One `note` line always comes back, whatever the verdict: it is the sentence, and the caller
# already has the verdict from the sibling signal.
#
# Held in a variable and printed under an explicit `exit 0`, because the exit code decides whether
# the sentence survives at all. `er-runtime-evidence.py` exits 1 when no log names the tip, and
# `pipefail` carries that out of the pipeline as this script's own status -- so on the one verdict
# that uses the note, cupcake stored
#
#     {"error": "", "exit_code": 1, "output": "...the newest log...", "success": false}
#
# instead of the string. The policy compares `trim_space(input.signals.runtime_evidence_note)`,
# which is undefined for an object, so the refusal fell back to its default and told the reader
# "no measurement was available" while the measurement sat inside the discarded object. Measured
# 2026-09-13 in the debug capture of a live refusal. What holds it now is an exit code, so the
# regression is caught as one: `run_runtime_evidence_signal_checks` in
# `scripts/test-cupcake-policies.py` runs both signals and fails on any non-zero status, whatever
# they answer.
