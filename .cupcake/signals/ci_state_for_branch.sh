# Cupcake signal: ci_state_for_branch
#
# Consumed by:
#   * no_false_ci_green (UserPromptSubmit): puts the MEASURED CI state of the current branch's PR
#     into context before the next answer is composed, so "green" / "passing" / "CI is clean" can
#     only be written when it is true.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# 2026-09-03: an answer described PR #384 as "pushed, green, and now carries the retraction" while
# `gh pr checks 384` reported `check  pending`. The word came from a LOCAL `scripts/check.sh` run
# that had exited 0 minutes earlier, and it silently became a claim about CI. The user reads "green"
# as "safe to merge", which is exactly the decision it is not safe to make from a local gate: local
# check.sh and GitHub CI are different job sets, and a push can be seconds old with nothing having
# run yet. Their words: "saying it is 'green' while CI is not passing on the latest push is
# objectively false."
#
# WHAT IT EMITS
#
#   CISTATE:<branch>:<pr number>:<verdict>:<summary>
#
# where verdict is one of PASS / PENDING / FAIL / NOPR / UNKNOWN, and summary is a compact
# `name=state` list. Nothing is emitted when there is no repo, no gh, or no PR -- an absent signal
# must never be read as an assertion about CI.
#
# WHY IT IS SAFE TO RUN EVERY PROMPT: one `gh pr checks` against the current branch, bounded to a
# few seconds, and it fails open on every error path. It does not push, edit, merge or comment.
