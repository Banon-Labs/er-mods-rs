# COMMAND POSITION (2026-08-31, bd protected-paths-parent-heredoc-prose-verb)
#
# has_verb answers "does this word appear anywhere in the text", which is the
# right question for a flag or an operand and the WRONG one for a program name.
# A word only runs when it stands in COMMAND POSITION: at the start of the text,
# or after a shell separator, optionally behind wrapper words and assignments.
#
# The distinction is not academic. The cupcake engine's `whitespace_normalization`
# enrichment replaces EVERY newline in a Bash command with a space before any
# policy runs (measured 2026-08-31 from `cupcake eval --debug-files`), so a
# heredoc body arrives welded onto the command that reads it:
#
#     cat > src/lib.rs <<'EOF' /// Install the detour ... EOF
#
# Under has_verb the prose word "Install" in a Rust doc comment is a destructive
# `install(1)`, and the `///` is a path operand. Under has_command_verb it is what
# it looks like: a word in the middle of an argument. Nothing that actually runs
# is lost, because a program a shell executes is in command position BY
# DEFINITION -- that is what command position means.
#
# WRAPPERS ARE FOLLOWED, so tightening cannot lose a real invocation: `sudo rm`,
# `env FOO=1 rm`, `nohup rm`, `xargs -0 rm`, `TMPDIR=/x rm` and option tokens in
# between all still resolve to the verb behind them.
#
# NOT COVERED, deliberately, because has_verb does not cover it either and this
# is not the change that closes it: a verb inside a quoted wrapper payload
# (`bash -c "rm -rf /"`). has_verb's own `(^|\s)` anchor never matched `"rm`, so
# both before and after this rule that shape is invisible here; callers that need
# it should read commands.executed_texts, which decomposes the payload into a
# text of its own where the verb IS in position 0.
# A separator, then any run of things that stand BEFORE a program without being
# one: assignments, option tokens, and wrapper words.  The second alternative
# lets a wrapper carry up to four arbitrary tokens of its own (`sudo -u root rm`,
# `xargs -I{} rm`), which option-shaped matching alone cannot reach because an
# option's ARGUMENT looks like nothing in particular.  Both alternatives only ever
# make the verb test match MORE commands, never fewer.
command_position_prefix_pattern := `(^|[;&|(){}\n])[ \t]*(([A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*=[^ \t]*|-{1,2}[A-Za-z0-9][^ \t]*|sudo|doas|env|command|nohup|time|exec|xargs|then|else|do)[ \t]+|(sudo|doas|env|command|nohup|time|exec|xargs)[ \t]+([^ \t;&|(){}]+[ \t]+){1,4})*`

# An optional path COMPONENT PREFIX immediately before a program name --
# `/bin/`, `/usr/bin/`, `./`, `../scripts/`. REQUIRES a trailing slash (the `?`
# makes the whole group optional, not the slash inside it), which is what stops
# a longer word that merely ENDS in the verb (`confirm` for `rm`, `xmv` for
# `mv`) from matching: the group can only consume characters that are
# immediately followed by a literal `/`, so a verb-shaped suffix with no
# preceding slash falls through to the zero-width alternative and then must
# match the verb starting exactly at the anchor. Shared with shell_name_pattern
# below rather than re-spelled, so the two callers cannot drift apart.
path_prefix_pattern := `([^ \t;&|()'"]*/)?`

# has_command_verb answers "is this word the program a shell would run", which
# command_position_prefix_pattern alone gets right for a BARE verb (`rm -rf x`)
# but not for one invoked by absolute or relative PATH (`/bin/rm -rf x`,
# `./rm -rf x`) -- measured 2026-08-31 (bd er-effects-rs-5z75): a leading path
# component is none of the anchor's separator characters, and the character
# immediately before the verb is `/`, so the anchor never lined up and
# `/bin/rm -rf .cupcake` / `/usr/bin/rm -rf .cupcake` were allowed outright by
# every guard that reads this function. NOT a regression: has_verb's
# `(^|\s)verb(\s|$)` boundary missed it identically, so this predates both the
# command-position work and the segmentation work that came before it -- it was
# simply never covered. Splicing path_prefix_pattern in between the
# command-position prefix and the verb closes it: the prefix must still resolve
# back to a real anchor (string start, a separator, or consumed wrapper words),
# so a slash deep inside an unrelated operand still cannot manufacture a match
# (see commands_test.rego for the negative cases this reasoning predicts).

# SHELL SEGMENTS (2026-08-31, bd er-effects-rs-c0t9)
#
# Moved here from guard_layer_destructive_guard.rego, which had the only copy.
# The move is the point: a SECOND segmenter written for the next policy that
# needs one is a divergence bug waiting to happen, and the next policy that
# needed one arrived the same day.
#
# WHAT PROBLEM IT SOLVES. A guard that ANDs a verb test with an operand test over
# the WHOLE command string is asking whether the two tokens are CO-PRESENT, not
# whether they belong to the same command. That is not the question any of these
# rules means to ask, and it fires on commands where the two never meet:
#
#     rm -rf <some unrelated dir> && mkdir -p <hooks dir> && cp shim <hooks dir>/
#
# -- a removal aimed at one path, and a hooks directory named in a DIFFERENT
# statement, read as removing a hook. Measured live twice on 2026-08-31, the
# second time on the bug report about the first, because the report quoted both
# tokens. Evaluating the predicate PER SEGMENT is what closes it.
#
# THE INPUT CONTRACT, and it is load-bearing: callers must pass text that has
# been through scan_text / executed_texts, never the raw command. This splits on
# separator CHARACTERS, so a `;` inside a quoted operand would split a segment a
# shell would keep whole -- and splitting the wrong place separates a verb from
# its operand, which is the fail-OPEN direction. executed_texts blanks the
# anchors inside quoted spans before this ever sees them, so under that contract
# a quoted separator is already a space. Both callers satisfy it.
#
# TWO GRANULARITIES, because `|` is not the same kind of boundary as the others.
# `;`, `&&`, `||`, `&` and a newline separate commands that share nothing. A PIPE
# separates commands that share a data stream -- which is exactly how a removal
# gets its operand from somewhere else in the line:
#
#     echo <hooks dir>/pre-commit | xargs rm -f
#
# The path is in one stage and the verb in the next, and the file is deleted all
# the same. So a co-presence guard whose verb set is small and specific should
# read shell_statements (pipelines kept whole) and accept the narrow over-denial
# that comes with it; a guard whose predicate is broad should read shell_segments
# and accept the narrow gap instead. The destructive guard is the broad case --
# at statement granularity `git diff .cupcake | grep -c restore` would be denied
# by its `git (checkout|restore|clean)` arm, which is a worse trade than the
# xargs gap. That choice is per policy; the SPLITTING is not, and lives here once.
#
# NOT SPLIT ON, deliberately: command substitution. `$(...)` really does open a
# new command context, but leaving it joined to its host errs toward treating
# `echo $(rm -rf <path>)` as one command that both removes and names the path --
# a DENY, the safe direction. Splitting it would be the direction that loses a
# real removal, so the honest gap here costs precision, never coverage.

# Statement boundaries only. `||` and `&&` are consumed WHOLE before the single
# characters, so that neither leaves a stray `|` behind to be read as a pipe.

# EXECUTED-TEXT DECOMPOSITION (2026-08-26, bd er-effects-rs-dt2e)
#
# A guard that anchors its command pattern on `(^|[;&|(\n])` is asking about
# LEXICAL POSITION in the raw command string. That is not the question it means
# to ask, and it is wrong in BOTH directions at once:
#
#   bash -c 'git push origin main'    the character before the verb is a quote,
#                                     which is not in that class, so the guard
#                                     sees nothing -- and the command RUNS.
#                                     AGENTS.md actively tells agents to wrap
#                                     commands this way for fish, so the bypass
#                                     form is one this repo recommends.
#
#   bd remember --key k "...          a newline IS in that class, so a memory
#   <the very command being guarded>  body, a commit message or a doc that
#   ..."                              merely QUOTES the command is denied --
#                                     and nothing was ever going to run.
#
# Widening the class alone makes the second failure worse while only partly
# fixing the first. The fix is to stop matching on position in the raw string
# and start matching on EXECUTED TEXT:
#
#   executed_texts(command)
#       the set of shell texts this command actually hands to a shell. Element
#       one is the command itself with quoted OPERAND spans anchor-neutralised
#       (their contents kept, so `git -C "/path with space" push` still parses,
#       but `\n ; & | ( )` inside them turned to spaces so quoted prose has no
#       command position). The remaining elements are the payloads of shell
#       wrappers -- `bash -c '<payload>'` and friends -- each decomposed the
#       same way, so a payload's own separators keep working while a payload's
#       own quoted prose does not.
#
#   executed_unquoted_texts(command)
#       the same set with quoted spans DELETED rather than neutralised, for
#       unanchored substring tests (`contains(cmd, "--flag")`) that must not
#       fire on a flag named inside quoted prose.
#
#   unparsed_shell_payload(command)
#       true when a shell wrapper is present whose payload could NOT be
#       decomposed, so callers can fail closed instead of treating the guard's
#       blindness as an allow.
#
# MEASURED ENGINE BEHAVIOUR (2026-08-26). `cupcake eval` replaces UNQUOTED
# newlines with spaces before policy evaluation, while newlines inside quotes
# survive. So a two-line command's second line arrives with no separator in
# front of it and is invisible to every anchored pattern -- in the live engine
# only; `opa test` sees the raw text. That is an engine-input problem, not one a
# pattern here can reach, and it is filed separately. Everything below behaves
# identically under both because it never depends on an unquoted newline.
#
# LIMITS, all deliberate and all fail-closed (they keep the RAW text, which is
# what the guards matched before this existed, so they can only deny more):
#   * command substitution -- `$(...)` or a backtick anywhere in a text leaves
#     that text un-neutralised, because substitution inside double quotes really
#     does execute;
#   * unbalanced quotes leave the text un-neutralised, because the quote-index
#     parity this relies on is meaningless once a quote is unmatched;
#   * exactly one heredoc is understood, and only with a resolvable terminator;
#   * wrapper nesting is followed three levels deep (see shell_payloads_deep).
