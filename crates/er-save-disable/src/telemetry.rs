//! Machine-readable census output -- the semaphore surface.
//!
//! This file, not the text log, is what a harness reads. It is RAM-derived in-process
//! telemetry, never a screenshot, and it is the run-stopping oracle for a
//! save-suppression proof: `escaped_write_sites` must be empty.
//!
//! Written event-driven rather than on a polling timer (this repo treats sleeps as a
//! synchronization smell), on a schedule chosen so the file is always current *where a
//! verdict is drawn from it*:
//!
//! - at install, so an absent file means "the DLL never loaded" rather than "nothing
//!   happened";
//! - on each newly discovered write site, the census's only interesting event;
//! - on the first swallowed save and at exponentially spaced milestones after it;
//! - on every quit-to-title settle, the moment the acceptance test is about.
//!
//! Publishing once per swallowed save was the earlier behaviour and was wrong: saves
//! are requested on every rune-total change, so it re-serialized and rewrote this file
//! on the save worker thread continuously. Nothing was gained, because every counter a
//! harness gates on is a *threshold*, and a threshold is crossed at a first occurrence
//! that is always published.

/// This one matters more than the text log, because it is the run-stopping oracle. In the game
/// directory it keeps ZERO previous generations -- [`write_snapshot`] publishes with a
/// write-tmp-then-rename, so the previous run's verdict is gone the instant this run installs,
/// with no `.prev` behind it. A harness reading the fixed game-directory path during a
/// concurrent session therefore scores somebody else's census as its own. Redirecting the
/// WRITER at launch is the only fix that survives a killed run: a copy at teardown never
/// happens for the run whose evidence matters most, and by teardown this run has already
/// overwritten the last one's file anyway.
