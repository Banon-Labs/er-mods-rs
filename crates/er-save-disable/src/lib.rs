//! Standalone ELDEN RING save-disable DLL.
//!
//! Deliberately decoupled from the product `er-quickload` cdylib: separate crate,
//! separate ME3 `[[natives]]` entry, separate log and telemetry files, no shared
//! state. The product already manipulates save-adjacent state during System->Quit
//! (it clears `CSMenuMan->disableSaveMenu` at +0x13c); keeping this DLL independent
//! means the two can be run separately and their effects told apart.
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! It BLOCKS saving. No byte of the player's save is written while it is loaded.
//!
//! Two cooperating layers, and it matters that they are separate:
//!
//! **Suppression** (the shared `er-save-suppress` crate; it lived here as `suppress.rs`
//! until save-game-flow WP1 moved it out so the product DLL integrates the identical
//! hooks) stops the game ever enqueueing a save-write job, at the single choke point
//! every save funnels through, and answers the game's own completion poll with the code
//! that means success. No save byte is written, no `.bak` is copied or deleted, and
//! every native observer sees the state a real successful save leaves. Loads are
//! untouched, so Continue and Load Game still read the real file.
//!
//! **NEVER load this DLL together with `er_quickload.dll` in one me3 profile.** The
//! product DLL now installs the same `er-save-suppress` hooks itself; each DLL carries
//! its own MinHook instance, so loading both would double-detour `0x140e6fb50` /
//! `0x140e6e430` and corrupt each other's trampolines. The census probe profile stays
//! product-DLL-free (`scripts/build-save-census-profile.sh`).
//!
//! **Census** (`hooks` + `witness`) hooks the Win32 file APIs *below* every FromSoft
//! abstraction and records the game-module RVA of any call site that still reaches save
//! data on disk. It was built to discover the write paths from the bottom up; with
//! suppression armed it inverts into the completeness oracle. `escaped_write_sites`
//! must be empty, and any entry in it names a save path the suppression missed.
//!
//! Keeping the census when suppression works is the whole point: the static call graph
//! proves the SL submit is the only *known* write path, and the census is what would
//! catch an unknown one.
