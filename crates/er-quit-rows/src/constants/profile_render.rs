// bug class (the repeated-switch spared-renderer leak: we excluded a CSMenuProfModelRend from the
// engine's delete to render the portrait, then a bare `store(0)` dropped our responsibility for it
// without discharging it, leaking one live renderer per switch). A raw `usize` in an AtomicUsize
// carries no ownership semantics, so `store(0)` reads as innocuous. This ledger makes ownership
// conservation observable: every "take" (we become responsible for freeing a native object) and
// "release" (we hand it back to the native lifecycle) is counted per class, and a per-switch check
// asserts outstanding <= bound. The old leak would have tripped this at switch #2 (outstanding
// climbing 1->2->3->4) instead of crashing the GX queue at #4. It is also the acceptance test for a
// future RAII `EngineOwned` wrapper: build the invariant first, then make it structurally unbreakable.
