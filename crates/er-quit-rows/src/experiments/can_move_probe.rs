//! Can-move readiness probe (2026-07-18, user-directed): Prove that input actually moves the
//! character, not just that it is render-ready. "render-ready" says the character can be seen;
//! this says input moves it. `play_time` advancing is necessary but not sufficient (it ticks during
//! the freeze), so movement is proven by a havok-position delta under a known injected forward stick,
//! sustained for `MOVE_PROBE_REQUIRED_FRAMES` (60) consecutive frames per load -- a real walk, not a
//! one-frame twitch. Runs on the game thread (safe to drive input); the XInput hook stamps the stick
//! when `MOVE_PROBE_ACTIVE`.
//!
//! Per load epoch (fresh_deser_count) the probe resets, then each render-ready frame it injects the
//! forward stick and counts consecutive frames whose horizontal displacement clears the threshold.
//! A static/frozen character repeats its position exactly (delta ~0), so it never accumulates; a
//! walking character clears 60 frames quickly and latches `CAN_MOVE_CONFIRMED`.
