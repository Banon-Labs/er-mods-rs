    // through which every movie edit this crate serves is delivered -- the `02_040` six-cell Quit
    // grid, the `05_010_ProfileSelect` stats panel, the `02_990` path-editor field. Losing it with
    // the cover took the Load Character and Load Character from File rows off the tab entirely (the
    // grid stayed vanilla, so there were no cells for them) and reverted the Save Game menu's
    // layout, measured live: `02_040 quit6` served 0 times in that run against 1 before it. Serving
    // a movie is not hiding a visual, so do not fold these two back into a visual gate.
