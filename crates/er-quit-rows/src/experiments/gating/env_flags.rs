//     The identically-named `TitleFlowHost` field is a different symbol and stays: bootstrap.rs
//     wires it to `|| false` and `er-title-flow` reads it, exactly like the four above.

//     render-drive. Its two call sites were
//     `is_native_windows() && native_profile_drive_disabled()`, never true. `is_native_windows()`
//     itself is untouched: input_block.rs, task_tick.rs and title_visual_startup.rs still call it.
//   * `own_stepper_passive_enabled` -- a marker-file-gated hand-driven own-stepper mode. Its idx10

//   * `inject_nav_enabled` -- an env/marker-file-gated fabricated D-pad-Down title nav. Its driver
