/// slot the container's `USER_DATA010` occupancy bitmap marks active, from that slot's own body --
/// name, level, play time, rune memory, map, `PlaceName`, `FaceData` and `ChrAsm`. It does no
/// snapshot/backout bookkeeping and no renderer refresh: the callers own those, because the two
/// callers want opposite things from them (a System>Quit preview is reversible; a boot autoload's
/// re-read is not a preview at all).
///
/// `summary_snapshot` is the whole `CS::ProfileSummary` allocation as it looked before this call --
/// used only as a structural template for slots whose visual blocks cannot be located, and read
/// before the zeroing below, so callers must capture it first.
///
/// Returns the mask of slots written plus each written slot's attribute line.
/// The caller hands over a clone of its candidate bytes, and must. Emptying the swap state's
/// `candidate_bytes` for the duration of this call (a `mem::take`) would make
/// `system_quit_committed_foreign_save_path` -- which the own-load feed reads to decide whether the
/// switch overrides the configured save -- report "no pick is active" for that window. One ~28 MB
/// memcpy per switch is cheaper than that race.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// `summary` must be the live `CS::ProfileSummary` allocation: this zeroes all ten records and
/// their occupancy bytes through raw pointers before rewriting them, with no fault guard, and
/// `summary_snapshot` must be the `PROFILE_SUMMARY_TOTAL_BYTES` image of that same allocation as
/// it looked before the call (see above). `base` must be the running game module base.
///
/// Must run on the game thread. It is destructive and not reversible by itself -- a caller that
/// needs to back out owns the snapshot/restore, which is why this function does none.
