//! The dependency-injection seam between this crate and its host DLL.
//!
//! Same pattern as `er_loading_portrait_core::host` / `er_quit_menu_core::host` /
//! `er_save_picker_core::host`: function pointers installed once at DLL attach, neutral
//! defaults until then, crate-internal wrappers bearing the EXACT names the moved code
//! already called.
//!
//! Every field below is one MEASURED cross-call into a concept this crate does NOT own:
//!
//! * the debug log sink;
//! * `GameDataMan`, which the product resolves once and caches -- this crate walks it to the
//!   summary but does not own finding it;
//! * the save-SOURCE decisions (`experiments::save_redirect`), which decide whether a picked
//!   or loose `save_file` is driving this boot and which staged container it resolves to;
//! * the autoload SLOT decision (`experiments::continue_load::slot_resolution`), which folds
//!   the picker's pick, the trigger file and the config together;
//! * the per-slot name/stats/map/place-name caches, which belong to the ProfileSelect
//!   stats-text surface, not to the records -- they are fed from the same container bytes but
//!   are read by the ROWS, so the row surface keeps them.
//!
//! A cross-call whose only consumers are inside this crate is a MOVE, not a seam entry (the
//! 2026-07-30 rule that no extracted crate reaches back into `er-effects-rs`).
