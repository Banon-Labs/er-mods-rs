//! Does the live `CS::ProfileSummary` still describe the character that will actually LOAD?
//!
//! # The assumption this exists to retire
//!
//! `picked_refresh`'s module doc used to say the records and the bodies "agree by construction",
//! because both come from the staged container. They do not. A container carries TWO descriptions
//! of each slot: the `USER_DATA010` profile-summary table, which is what
//! `CS::ProfileSummary::Deserialize` reads, and the slot BODY, which is what actually deserializes
//! into the character. Nothing keeps them in step, and a container assembled by tooling can
//! disagree with itself. Measured 2026-09-03 on `100-Lilbro/ER0000.co2` (6 of 10 slots disagree):
//!
//! ```text
//! slot 4 body='Hero'  lvl=7 bodymap=0x0e000000 | USER_DATA010 name='Vagabond' lvl=9 block=0x1c000000
//! slot 8 body='Prophet' lvl=7                  | USER_DATA010 name='Pro'      lvl=7
//! ```
//!
//! `Hero` loaded; the loading screen showed `Vagabond`'s face, name and level, because the portrait
//! and the stats panel both read the RECORD. The body is the truth about what loads, so the record
//! has to be made to agree with it.
//!
//! # Why a watch rather than one rewrite
//!
//! The DLL's body-derived rewrite is not the last writer. In run br-20260903-204517-82d2 it landed
//! at +13523ms and the game's own boot ProfileSummary read fired 617ms later and overwrote it, and
//! `refresh_direct_source_profile_summary` had already latched `PICKED_SUMMARY_REFRESH_STATE` so it
//! never looked again. Whoever writes last wins, so the only durable answer is to keep checking for
//! a bounded window and re-assert on drift.
