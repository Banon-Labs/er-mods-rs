//! Make a PICKED save's `CS::ProfileSummary` real at the title, so the native Continue row can
//! load it the same way it loads the default save.
//!
//! # Why a picked save had no summary
//!
//! The records the Load-Character rows and `profile_slot_fingerprint` read come from the save
//! container's own `USER_DATA010` table, parsed by `CS::ProfileSummary::Deserialize`
//! (`0x140261f00` -> `0x140261f10`: ten occupancy bytes into `summary+0x8`, then ten records of
//! `0x2a0` from `summary+0x18` via `0x140261cf0`). The game runs that exactly once, inside the boot
//! common-data load (`0x1402570c0`, reached from the save-data `ShowProgressJob`'s delegate).
//!
//! At a BOOT picker that read comes free: the DLL holds the save-data job in `Continue` until the
//! user picks, then passes it through, and the delegate reads the redirected container. A LATE pick
//! -- the boot check accepted a save, the autoload could not load it, and the picker armed
//! afterwards -- has no such job left to run, so the summary keeps describing the save that was
//! rejected, or nothing at all.
//!
//! # What this does instead
//!
//! `MarkProfileIndexAsUsed` (`0x140262250`) is NOT the answer and was checked before this was
//! written: its entire body is `if (slot < 10) { saveSlotsStates[slot] = true; return true; }`. It
//! sets an occupancy FLAG and touches no record field, so a slot it marks still fingerprints empty
//! and the native Continue row still has nothing to load.
//!
//! Rather than re-enter the boot job (an async container read plus a full common-data parse that
//! would also re-deserialize GameSettings, the key config and the net-penalty state at the title),
//! this rebuilds the records directly from the staged container's own bytes, through the SAME
//! writer the System>Quit foreign-save preview already uses -- name, level, play time, rune memory,
//! map, `PlaceName`, `FaceData` and `ChrAsm` per slot, occupancy included. It builds them from each
//! slot's BODY, which is what deserializes into the character.
//!
//! # The records and the bodies do NOT "agree by construction"
//!
//! This doc used to claim they did, on the grounds that both come from the staged container. A
//! container holds two independent descriptions of a slot -- the `USER_DATA010` table the game's
//! own read deserializes, and the body -- and they can disagree; measured 2026-09-03 on
//! `100-Lilbro/ER0000.co2`, 6 of 10 slots did, including the one that was loading (`slot 4 body
//! 'Hero' lvl 7` vs `USER_DATA010 'Vagabond' lvl 9`). Two things follow, and both are implemented
//! below rather than assumed:
//!
//! * a record that fingerprints REAL is not evidence that the summary is CORRECT, so the native
//!   fast path verifies against the body instead of accepting realness as final;
//! * our rewrite is not necessarily the last write. The game's boot ProfileSummary read landed
//!   617ms after ours in run br-20260903-204517-82d2 and replaced every record, and the loading
//!   screen then showed `Vagabond`'s face, name and level under `Hero`'s load. See
//!   [`crate::reassert_policy`] for the bounded drift watch that answers it (bd er-effects-rs-ccud).
//!
//! It deliberately does NOT call the profile-renderer refresh: that AVs when the renderer table has
//! not been built yet (`0x9aa6d4`, observed), and at the boot title it has not.
