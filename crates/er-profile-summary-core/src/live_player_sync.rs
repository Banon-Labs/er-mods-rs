//! Re-deriving one record from the character that is live right now.
//!
//! # The gap this closes
//!
//! [`crate::save_bytes_records`] rebuilds records from a save container's bytes. That is the right
//! source when the question is "what does this file hold", and the wrong one when the question is
//! "what is the player wearing this instant" -- a build import mutates `PlayerGameData` and writes
//! no save, so the container is behind and so is every record derived from it.
//!
//! The game has its own answer and this module calls it rather than re-implementing it.
//! [`PROFILE_SUMMARY_UPDATE_FROM_LIVE_PLAYER_RVA`] is
//! `CS::ProfileSummary::UpdateRecordFromLivePlayer(summary, slot)` in all but name, and its whole
//! body is the live character copied into one record:
//!
//! ```text
//! FUN_140262270(ProfileSummary *summary, uint slot)   // 1.16.2; refuses slot >= 10
//!   pgd = GameDataMan->mainPlayerGameData
//!   wcsncpy(record+0x00, FUN_14025f8e0(pgd), 0x10)    // name, terminated at +0x20
//!   record+0x24 = pgd->level
//!   record+0x2c = pgd->runeMemory
//!   record+0x28 = GetPlayTimeInSeconds()
//!   FUN_14025f900(pgd, record)                        // FaceData +0x38, ChrAsm +0x1a8, gender +0x290
//!   record+0x291 = pgd->archetype
//!   record+0x292 = pgd->startingGift
//!   record+0x293 = pgd->field_0xc4
//!   record+0x30  = GetCurrentMapId()
//!   record+0x34  = CSFeMan+0x653c                     // the PlaceName a row's Location shows
//! ```
//!
//! and the equipment step inside it is the one that matters here:
//!
//! ```text
//! FUN_14025f900(PlayerGameData *pgd, longlong record)
//!   FUN_1403bffa0(record+0x1a8)                       // release the 22 handles the record held
//!   FUN_140251580(record+0x38, &pgd->faceData)
//!   FUN_140245c00(record+0x1a8, &pgd->equipGameData.chrAsm)   // ChrAsm::Copy, live -> record
//!   record+0x290 = pgd->gender
//!   FUN_1403bffa0(record+0x1a8)                       // un-index the handles just copied in
//! ```
//!
//! # Why the record is what a portrait shows
//!
//! `FUN_1409aa680` -- `er_loading_portrait_core::PROFILE_RENDERER_REFRESH_RVA` -- is the only
//! caller of the profile renderer's set-ChrAsm (`FUN_140bbe1a0`; one call xref in the 1.16.2 dump,
//! the other two being vtable data), and the source it passes is `record + 0x1a8`. So a profile
//! portrait is dressed from a record and from nothing else, and a record that still describes the
//! pre-import loadout renders the pre-import loadout however many times the model is rebuilt.
//! Syncing first is what makes a rebuild worth asking for.
//!
//! # When the game does this by itself
//!
//! Only at a save. The two callers of the native in the 1.16.2 dump are `FUN_14067b750` and
//! `FUN_14067b940`, both `GameMan` save lanes, and each opens with
//! `MarkProfileIndexAsUsed(summary, slot)` then this function then the serialize. So an import that
//! writes no save leaves the record behind until something else saves -- which is the whole defect.
