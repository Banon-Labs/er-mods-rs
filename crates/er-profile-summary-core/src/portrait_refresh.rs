//! Making a character panel's portrait show the build that was just imported.
//!
//! # Why an import leaves it showing the previous loadout
//!
//! The portrait is the game's own widget, not anything this workspace composites. `FUN_1409aa680`
//! (`er_loading_portrait_core::PROFILE_RENDERER_REFRESH_RVA`) is the only caller of the profile
//! renderer's set-ChrAsm `FUN_140bbe1a0` -- one call xref in the 1.16.2 dump, the other two
//! references being vtable data -- and the source it hands over is `record + 0x1a8`, the `ChrAsm`
//! image inside a `CS::ProfileSummary` record. So the gear a portrait wears is whatever that record
//! says, and nothing else.
//!
//! The record is re-derived from the live character only by the native
//! [`crate::live_player_sync`] calls, whose two game-side callers are the `GameMan` save lanes. A
//! build import writes no save, so nothing re-derives the record and the portrait keeps the
//! pre-import loadout.
//!
//! The rebuild is gated as well, by a step machine. `CSMenuAsmModelRend` derives from
//! `FD4StepTemplateBase`, its step table is filled by `FUN_1400a75c0`, and its current step index
//! lives at `renderer+0x40`. A settled portrait sits in step 6, `STEP_Wait_Play`, which reads three
//! request bytes in strict priority:
//!
//! ```text
//! +0x756 -> SetNextStep(7) and run it this frame     // hard teardown
//! +0x755 -> SetNextStep(7)                           // teardown next frame
//! +0x754 -> SetNextStep(1)                           // re-promote the stages, no teardown
//! none   -> the live per-frame block
//! ```
//!
//! Arming both is what produces a real rebuild, and the walk closes only because of one function:
//! `STEP_Finish_Play` clears `+0x755` and `+0x756` together (`*(u16*)(renderer+0x755) = 0`) and
//! leaves `+0x754` alone, so step 8 `STEP_Finish` finds it still set and sends the machine back to
//! step 1. The whole cycle is `6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6`, and step 4
//! `STEP_Finish_Setup` is the one that matters: it promotes the staged `ChrAsm` into the live one at
//! `+0x130`, allocates the model, registers its parts into the offscreen's layer holder
//! (`FUN_1409e9790`) and registers the per-frame submit task at group 100.
//!
//! Two arming mistakes are worth naming because each looks plausible. `+0x755` alone parks the
//! machine at step 8 forever and the portrait goes permanently blank. `+0x754` alone walks
//! `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6` with no teardown, and the builder `FUN_140bbb3b0` is null-guarded on
//! every allocation, so it is a complete no-op: the stages are re-promoted and the model is not
//! rebuilt at all. Only the pair does the work.
//!
//! # So the repair is two steps, in this order
//!
//! Re-derive the record from the live character, then rebuild the model from it. Neither is
//! sufficient alone: a rebuild without the sync faithfully renders the old gear again, and a sync
//! without the rebuild changes nothing until the dialog is reconstructed.
//!
//! # Which slot, and which one this deliberately does not touch
//!
//! The record synced is the one belonging to the character that is loaded -- the same field the two
//! native save lanes pass to the native. That is the only record it is correct to overwrite with
//! live data: it is that character's own summary. The tempting shortcut is to write the live
//! character into `record[0]` instead, on the theory that the panel always binds entry 0. That must
//! not happen whatever the display turns out to bind: `record[0]` belongs to a different character,
//! the whole ten-record table is serialized by the next save, and the corruption would reach disk.
//! [`BUILD_URL_PORTRAIT_RECORD_SLOT_PLUS1`] records the slot a run actually used.
//!
//! # Which surface this drives, and the one it is now known not to be
//!
//! Everything below drives a `CSMenuAsmModelRend` and its offscreen render target, published to
//! Scaleform as `SYSTEX_Menu_Profile{NN}`. That is what the `05_010_ProfileSelect` list shows: its
//! `MENU_DummyProfileFace_01..10` external-image symbols are bound to those ten targets.
//!
//! The System>Quit panel is not one of them, and an earlier version of this file asserted that it
//! was. Read out of the vanilla movie (`menu/win/02_040_optionsetting.gfx`): the Quit Game panel is
//! sprite 138 `MENU_FL_QuitGame` placing `PlayerInfo` = sprite 137 `GameEnd`, whose `Icon_0` is
//! sprite 130 -- a one-frame sprite holding image char 74, `MENU_DummyStatus_Face`, 512x256. The
//! movie contains zero occurrences of `DummyProfileFace`. So `Icon_0.gotoAndStop(row[+8] + 1)`, the
//! call the old reasoning rested on, is inert on this surface; it is load-bearing only on 05_010,
//! whose `Icon_0` really does have ten frames.
//!
//! `MENU_DummyStatus_Face` was measured on run `br-20260911-011717-d587` (+45137ms): it binds
//! `SYSTEX_Menu_StatusFace`, which is a different target from the ten this module drives. So the
//! producer here serves ProfileSelect, and the Quit panel has a producer of its own.
//!
//! # The Quit panel's own producer, which now has a module of its own
//!
//! `SYSTEX_Menu_StatusFace` is filled by `CS::CSMenuFaceModelRend`, built by
//! `FUN_14099b950(rendSlot, dialog, 0x13, faceSource, 1)` with the renderer slot at
//! `dialog+0x1890`. Its single caller is `CS::OptionSettingTopDialog`'s constructor, at the guarded
//! tail `if (param_4 != 0) { ... }`, which is why backing out of the menu and reopening it fixes
//! the portrait: reconstructing the dialog re-runs the builder against the current
//! `PlayerGameData`.
//!
//! That surface is driven by [`crate::quit_panel_portrait`], which is where its reverse
//! engineering lives. Two corrections to what this section used to say are worth carrying, because
//! both were load-bearing and both were wrong:
//!
//! * it is not a sibling class. `CS::CSMenuFaceModelRend` **derives from** `CSMenuAsmModelRend` --
//!   its constructor calls that constructor on the same `this` and then overwrites the vftable --
//!   so `+0x40`, `+0x754`, `+0x755`, `+0x778` and the part-node array are the same fields, not
//!   parallel ones, and this module's rebuild detector applies to it unchanged;
//! * the two addresses are no longer unmapped. `0x14099b950 -> 0x14099caf0` and
//!   `0x140966120 -> 0x1409672c0` were pinned on 2026-09-10 and carry `IDENTICAL-WHOLE` verdicts in
//!   `docs/recon/rva-map-1162-to-1170.verified.tsv`; `map-rvas-1162-to-1170.py` resolves both from
//!   the ledger alone. The refresh is written, and it refuses rather than calls when an address in
//!   its chain has no mapping.
//!
//! The remaining difference between the two surfaces is what each one renders. The profile portrait
//! wears the record's gear. The Quit panel's takes `param_5 = 1`, which unequips every weapon slot
//! and equips the default protectors, so it is the character's face on a neutral body: appearance,
//! gender and the hollow flag. An oracle looking for imported gear on that surface would be looking
//! for something it never draws.
//!
//! # What is measured, and the measurement that was not enough
//!
//! A kick count says a rebuild was requested, so the first oracle here compared the renderer's live
//! stage-0 `ChrAsm` against the record and published [`BUILD_URL_PORTRAIT_EQUIP_VERDICT`]. Run
//! `br-20260911-002901-a7e0` then read that field as a pass -- record and renderer stage agreed on
//! the imported loadout, the kick was accepted, the level moved to the imported 150 -- while the
//! player was still looking at the previous armour.
//!
//! The field was true and useless. Setting a renderer's `ChrAsm` is a state write, and the portrait
//! is a captured render: until the model is destroyed, reassembled from the new rows and
//! rasterized, the picture is the old one however correct the input. An oracle that stops at the
//! input cannot fail on the defect it is supposed to catch.
//!
//! So the headline is now [`BUILD_URL_PORTRAIT_RENDER_VERDICT`], a conjunction. It reaches its pass
//! value only when the input matched and the model object was observed being torn down and rebuilt
//! with a different set of parts -- `renderer+0x778` going absent, and the part-node array the model
//! submit walks coming back different. Its other values name the failures apart: the input took and
//! the model never moved, the model rebuilt and came back identical, the input was wrong.
//!
//! That is still RAM rather than pixels, and the honest limit is worth stating: a rebuilt model with
//! different parts is the last thing observable in memory before the rasterizer, not the rasterizer
//! itself. A gate on the pixels would have to read back the renderer's own offscreen render target
//! (`renderer+0xa8` -> `CSEzOffscreenRend`, `+0x10` -> `CSRuntimeTexResCap`, `+0x78` ->
//! `CSGxTexture`, which `er_loading_portrait_core::resource_readback` already knows how to fetch)
//! before the import and after the rebuild, and require the two images to differ.
