//! The guard registry.
//!
//! A *guard* is a detour that intercepts one vanilla function, recognises one argument shape the
//! function's own contract does not admit, and returns immediately with a value the function
//! itself already produces. Everything else falls through to the original.
//!
//! # Rules a new guard must satisfy
//!
//! 1. **Return the guarded function's OWN value for "nothing here".** Find the branch inside the
//!    original that already handles the empty/absent case and return exactly what it returns. A
//!    guard that invents a return value is asserting something the game never asserts, and the
//!    callers were not written against it.
//! 2. **Check the callers before trusting that value.** A crash is not automatically worse than
//!    what a caller does with a wrong answer. `null_special_effect` exists in two halves precisely
//!    because guarding only the query would have sent the crashing caller into an apply path that
//!    faults on the same field -- see that module's header.
//! 3. **Pin the address by its bytes.** Every RVA here is a 1.16.2 address. `expected_prologue` is
//!    checked against the live image before the hook is installed, so a different build disarms
//!    that guard loudly instead of detouring whatever now lives at the address.
//! 4. **Never clobber the ABI.** Detours are naked stubs that either return a constant or tail-jump
//!    to the original with every register and the entire incoming stack frame untouched. That is
//!    what makes a guard safe on a function whose stack arguments we have not typed.
//!
//! Adding a guard: write the stub -- with [`null_arg1_guard`] when the null thing is the first
//! argument, by hand when it is not -- then add one [`Guard`] row to [`REGISTRY`]. No install,
//! logging, or telemetry code changes. A guard whose stub needs an address it cannot compute
//! itself, such as a game global, resolves it in `prepare`, which runs before the hook arms.
