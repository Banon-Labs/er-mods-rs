//! The patch registry.
//!
//! A *patch* rewrites one byte of the game's own code. It exists for the crashes a detour cannot
//! reach: a fault raised by an instruction in the middle of a function, where intercepting the
//! function's entry would mean reimplementing everything that function does.
//!
//! This is a heavier tool than a [`guard`](crate::guards), and the bar is correspondingly higher.
//!
//! # Rules a new patch must satisfy
//!
//! 1. **The patched-out instruction must be provably optional.** Not "probably harmless" -- the
//!    surrounding code has to already contain a path that skips it, and the window must contain
//!    the evidence. [`freelist_shutdown_assert`] patches an `INT3` whose own `JZ` jumps exactly one
//!    byte past it: both paths converge on the next instruction, so removing the break produces
//!    the byte-identical behaviour the game already has whenever the assertion holds.
//! 2. **Pin the address by a window, not by the byte.** A lone `0xcc` occurs everywhere. The window
//!    is generated from named `iced-x86` instructions by this crate's `build.rs` and ground-truthed
//!    against `eldenring-deobf.bin` there, then re-checked against the live image before anything
//!    is written.
//! 3. **Write one byte, not the window.** The verified window is live code other threads may be
//!    executing. Rewriting bytes that were already correct widens that race for no gain, so
//!    [`Patch::offset`] names the single byte that changes.
//! 4. **Read it back.** A successful `VirtualProtect` is not proof the byte landed; another mod can
//!    own the same address. The install path reads the byte after writing it and reports what it
//!    found there.
//!
//! # What a patch cannot tell you
//!
//! A guard carries a block counter, and a nonzero count is a fault the game would otherwise have
//! taken. A patch has no such counter: the instruction it removes never runs, so nothing can count
//! it. [`Patch::applied`] says the byte changed, and that is all it says. Evidence that a patch
//! fixed anything has to come from outside the process -- for [`freelist_shutdown_assert`], from a
//! quit that leaves no crash record where one was previously written every time.
