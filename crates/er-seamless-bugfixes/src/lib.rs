//! Crash guards for faults only Seamless Co-op's networking mode can reach.
//!
//! Seamless Co-op puts the session into states vanilla Elden Ring reaches rarely or never, and
//! vanilla code paths written against the narrower states fault there. This DLL intercepts those
//! specific functions and returns the value the function itself already returns for the case it
//! failed to handle. It patches nothing in `ersc.dll` and adds no behaviour of its own.
//!
//! Every guard lives in [`guards::REGISTRY`]; see [`guards`] for the rules one has to satisfy. The
//! first is [`guards::null_special_effect`], a null `SpecialEffect` container reached through
//! `CS::SummonBuddyManager::Update`'s networked spirit-summon loop.
//!
//! A second, heavier mechanism lives in [`patches::REGISTRY`]: one rewritten instruction byte, for
//! a fault raised in the middle of a function where detouring the entry would mean reimplementing
//! everything the function does. Only [`patches::freelist_shutdown_assert`] uses it, and only to
//! remove an `INT3` the game's own `JZ` already jumps over. See [`patches`] for the rules; they are
//! stricter than a guard's, because a patch cannot report whether it was ever needed.
//!
//! # Version pinning, and the order it has to happen in
//!
//! Guard and patch addresses are 1.16.2 RVAs, and the shipped game has been 1.17 since
//! 2026-08-27. So every address is first RESOLVED for the running build -- through
//! [`er_game_base::game_build`] -- and only then re-checked against the live image's bytes.
//!
//! That order is the whole of this section, because it was the other way round and the cost is
//! measured. The byte check ran at a raw `base + rva`, which on 1.17 is unrelated code: all three
//! guards and the one patch failed the comparison and disarmed, reporting `byte mismatch` --
//! wording that reads as a stale SIGNATURE when the fault was an untranslated ADDRESS. The
//! `LoadBalancerParam` guard was among them, and on 2026-08-30 the exact crash it exists to stop
//! killed a session that had it "installed": `install complete: 0/3 guard(s) armed` at attach,
//! `DLPanic` at `FD4Singleton.h:180` twenty-five hours later.
//!
//! With resolution first, three outcomes are distinguishable in the log and they send a reader to
//! three different places:
//!
//! * `REFUSED` -- this build moved the address and nothing here knows where to. Nothing was read,
//!   nothing was written, and the fix is a ledger row, not a new signature.
//! * `DISARMED` -- the address resolved and the bytes there are not the ones it was verified
//!   against. Something else owns the address, or the mapping is wrong.
//! * `ARMED` / `PATCHED` -- installed.
//!
//! A refusal is per row. One guard with no mapping costs that guard and nothing else; see bd
//! `one-refused-hook-must-not-abort-the-installer-2026-08-30`.
//!
//! # Why a private MinHook instance, and why that is safe here
//!
//! The repo's usual rule is to route a companion DLL's detours through the product's
//! `er_effects_union_register` export, so a single MinHook instance owns every shared prologue.
//! That is not available to these guards: the union's handler type is
//! `fn(usize, usize, usize, usize) -> usize`, and `er-hook` states plainly that it is "not for
//! float-arg or >4-stack-arg targets". `CS::SpecialEffect::Apply` takes eight arguments, four of
//! them on the stack. Its union dispatcher would forward only the register four and drop the rest,
//! which corrupts the call rather than protecting it -- worse than the crash being guarded.
//!
//! So both guards use this DLL's own MinHook instance, which is safe because no er-quickload DLL
//! hooks either address (searched repo-wide), and because the install-time prologue check is itself
//! the collision detector: a second MinHook instance that got there first would have replaced the
//! entry with a jump, the byte comparison would fail, and the guard would disarm loudly instead of
//! trampling a trampoline. If the product ever does hook one of these addresses, that check turns
//! the collision into a log line rather than a silent corruption.

// Everything below the crate docs is the install path, and the install path is `cfg(windows)`: on
// the host there is no game to hook, so the registry rows, their stubs, and the logging they feed
// have no caller. That is a cfg artifact, not dead code -- the same reason `er-invasion-warp`
// carries this attribute. Without it `cargo test -p er-seamless-bugfixes` cannot even build,
// which is how the crate's own host tests came to be unrunnable.
