//! Standalone ME3 shell for the two System>Quit character rows, with no product DLL in the
//! profile.
//!
//! Each row is a cell of the same derived six-cell Quit grid `er-quit-menu` stands on, cloned by
//! the same `er_quit_menu_core::row_cloner`. The difference between the two shells is one argument:
//! this one passes a [`RowSet`](er_quit_menu_core::row_cloner::RowSet) carrying the character pair
//! and supplies the flows those rows need. A row that is not in the set is never cloned, so a press
//! that could reach a flow this shell does not have never happens.
//!
//! # What the rows do
//!
//! **Load Character** submits the game's own `05_010_ProfileSelect` window over the System dialog
//! the press came from -- the character picker the title screen uses, opened in-world. Everything
//! after that is the game's: the cursor, the list, the confirm box and the load the confirm arms.
//! This shell installs nothing on any of it. **Load Character from File** opens the browse picker
//! in `er_quit_menu_core::save_picker_menu` and hands the pick to the same window.
//!
//! That is the whole difference from the product. `er-quickload` detours
//! `CS::ProfileLoadDialog::load_activate` and turns a pick into its own save-safe switch -- return
//! to the title, tear the world down, reload the picked slot -- because it has a return-title
//! chain, a title-time continue driver and an autoload phase machine in flight, and the native
//! in-world load collides with them. None of that exists here, so the native chain is left to run.
//! **Whether it completes has not been observed**; see the pull request for what is and is not
//! proven.
//!
//! # The second character row, and what it still does not carry
//!
//! **Load Character from File** browses and opens, since the picker moved to
//! `er_quit_menu_core::save_picker_menu` on 2026-09-11. What a standalone shell does not install is
//! the product's nine picker steps -- the layout editor's font heights, the save-swap ledger's row
//! records, the save-flow box, the intent router and the three passive nav-input reads. Each has a
//! neutral default, so the surface is the game's own chrome rather than the product's, and a held
//! direction is never seen: the edge-scroll and the drive strip answer only to activations.
//!
//! # Never in the same profile as the product, or as `er-quit-menu`
//!
//! All three derive the same six-cell `02_040_optionsetting` grid, and
//! `er_gfx::options_02_040::quit6` fail-closes when its input is not vanilla -- so a second deriver
//! handed already-derived bytes correctly refuses, and co-loading cannot produce a working tab.
//! `scripts/me3-dll-conflicts.toml` records both pairs as duplicate owners, and the profile
//! generator refuses to emit a profile carrying two of them.
//!
//! # What stays refused here
//!
//! Every product-owned answer in the host seam stays at its neutral default -- including the
//! save-write bypass, so a product-less load can never push a write past `er-save-suppress`.

// A cdylib whose every consumer is `DllMain` and the hooks it installs, all of them
// `#[cfg(windows)]`. On a host build the shell is compiled with its only callers cfg'd
// out, so `dead_code`/`unused_imports` there report the cfg, not real debt. The shipping
// target (x86_64-pc-windows-msvc) carries the full deny with no allows.
