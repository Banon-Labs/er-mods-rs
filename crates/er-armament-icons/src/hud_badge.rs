//! Ash-of-War badge on the in-game HUD weapon slots (`01_000_fe.gfx`).
//!
//! # Why this needs its own hooks
//!
//! The menu badge rides `TilePopulate` (`FUN_1408ff470`), which never reaches HUD tiles: across
//! 9216 populates in run 20260727-233703, ZERO bound `Dish`/`MpShortage`/`ReloadedIcon` -- the
//! HUD quick-slot child signature -- and the child probe already tests `Dish/Root`, so that is a
//! tested negative rather than an assumption.
//!
//! # The HUD slot map (1.16.2, read out of `PlayerHUDScene`)
//!
//! `PlayerHUDScene` builds seven `ItemPanel` slots; the per-frame driver `FUN_1408d0900`
//! updates each one. Component pointers are offsets into the scene object:
//!
//! ```text
//!   path                            component      ctor            updater
//!   PlayerHUD/ItemPanel/Magic       scene+0x0b70   FUN_1408d19b0   FUN_1408d2320
//!   PlayerHUD/ItemPanel/Item        scene+0x15d8   FUN_1408d19b0   FUN_1408d2320
//!   PlayerHUD/ItemPanel/LeftWep     scene+0x2040   FUN_1408d1d00   FUN_1408d2110
//!   PlayerHUD/ItemPanel/RightWep    scene+0x2848   FUN_1408d1d00   FUN_1408d2110
//!   PlayerHUD/ItemPanel/ArrowBolt   scene+0x3050   FUN_1408d1b90   FUN_1408d2410
//!   PlayerHUD/ItemPanel/Arts        scene+0x3ff8   FUN_1408d1d00   FUN_1408d2110
//!   PlayerHUD/ItemPanel2/Item_0..3  scene+0x48d0 + i*0x808         FUN_1408d2110
//! ```
//!
//! This table is the correction to an earlier wrong reading. `FUN_1408d19b0` was taken for "the
//! armament slot ctor called exactly twice", and it IS called exactly twice -- for **Magic** and
//! **Item**. So every earlier HUD run drove the spell and quick-item slots, which is precisely
//! what the user saw: green placeholder squares on the quick-item strip and never anything on
//! the weapons. `scripts/disas-annotate-strings.py 0x1408cf3c0` prints the table above straight
//! out of the image; `crates/er-gfx/tests/hud_tree_probe.rs` asserts the movie side of it.
//!
//! # The three hooks
//!
//! * `FUN_1408d0900(scene, alpha, viewModel)` -- the per-frame slot driver. Hooked ONLY to learn
//!   the scene pointer, which is what turns a component into a slot identity. Without it the two
//!   weapon components are indistinguishable except by address ordering, and ordering is a guess.
//!
//! * `FUN_1408d1d00(component, panelClip)` -- the weapon slot ctor (LeftWep, RightWep, Arts and
//!   the four `ItemPanel2` items). It resolves `Fade/Item` from the panel clip -- falling back to
//!   `Fade` when absent, which is how the icon-less `Arts` slot goes through the same ctor -- and
//!   hands that clip to the generic child binder. The ctor knows the COMPONENT, the binder knows
//!   the CLIP, and neither knows both, so the two are paired by a same-thread handshake.
//!
//! * `FUN_1408d1e30(component+0x68, tileClip, textClip)` -- the generic child binder, hooked for
//!   its `rdx` only. It binds `ItemIcon/IconImage`, `AttributeIcon/IconImage`, `Dish/Root`,
//!   `Grayout`, `Flash`, `MpShortage`, `inadequacy`, `ReloadedIcon/IconImage`, `Text/Name`,
//!   `Text/Stock` -- and finally resolves a child literally named `ArtsIcon` and hides it.
//!
//!   That last hide CANNOT reach this badge: the resolver (`FUN_140d7f9d0`) splits the requested
//!   name on `/` and walks one member per segment (`strchr(name, '/')` at `0x140d7fa19`), so it
//!   has no recursive search and a request for `ArtsIcon` never matches `ItemIcon/ArtsIcon`. The
//!   nested mount is therefore safe by construction, not by luck.
//!
//! * `FUN_1408d2110(component, alpha, slotData)` -- the weapon slot update. Shared by seven
//!   components, so the scene offset (above) is what selects the two that draw.
//!
//! # Float arguments
//!
//! Both `FUN_1408d0900` and `FUN_1408d2110` take a `float` in `xmm1` (each saves it immediately:
//! `movaps xmm6, xmm1`). A detour declared `fn(usize, usize, usize)` leaves `xmm1` as a volatile
//! register the detour body may clobber before it reaches the trampoline, which would corrupt the
//! HUD fade value. Declaring the parameter as `f32` in position 1 puts it in `xmm1` under the
//! win64 ABI and passes it through untouched.
//!
//! # Where the ash comes from
//!
//! NOT from the HUD slot struct: `FUN_1408d0900` takes its data from a HUD view-model, which is
//! filled elsewhere. The equipped weapon is read directly instead, through the same named chain
//! the game uses:
//!
//! ```text
//! WorldChrMan(+0x1e508)          -> PlayerIns
//! GetWeaponGaitemHandleBySlot    -> gaitem handle for a ChrAsmSlot
//! GetGaitemInsByHandle           -> GaitemLookupResult
//! GetSwordArtsParamForWeapon     -> SwordArtsParamLookupResult   (via the real equipped GEM)
//! row + 0x1A                     -> SwordArtsParam.iconId
//! ```
//!
//! `GetSwordArtsParamIdForWeapon` resolves through `GetGemGaitemHandleFromWeapon` ->
//! `GetGaitemInsGem`, i.e. the ACTUAL equipped gem, so unlike the menu path's `arts_id * 100`
//! heuristic it does not miss weapons whose gem id is not derived from the arts id (Igon's Drake
//! Hunt: arts 4210 -> gem 548000).
//!
//! Every RVA below was verified with `scripts/verify-hook-address.py`, which compares MNEMONIC
//! and instruction LENGTH between the 1.16.2 dump and `eldenring-deobf.bin` -- the dump is
//! authoritative for MEANING, the deobf binary for ADDRESSES, and they are not the same file.
