//! THE SIZE LAW: one creature height in, one camera row out. Pure arithmetic, no game.
//!
//! # What the law is FOR, stated as a measurement
//!
//! Possessing something six times your size used to crop its head off the top of the screen. The
//! user reported the vanilla composition they wanted in the same breath: *"when I'm in my normal
//! form, I have at least a full character's height between my head and the top of the screen"*.
//! That is not a matter of taste, it is a ratio, and it can be computed from the shipped params:
//!
//! * `LockCamParam` row 0 puts the camera **3.8 m** from a pivot **1.45 m** up a **1.5 m** body,
//!   with a vertical field of view of **48 degrees**.
//! * A 48-degree vertical FOV spans `tan(24 deg) = 0.4452` of the depth either side of the axis,
//!   so at 3.8 m the frame is 1.6919 m tall above centre.
//! * The head sits 1.5 - 1.45 = 0.05 m above the aim point, i.e. **2.96%** of the way from the
//!   centre of the screen to the top.
//! * So the gap from the head to the top edge is `(1 - 0.0296) * 1.6919 = 1.642 m` -- **1.09 times
//!   the subject's own height.**
//!
//! "At least a full character's height" is 1.09 character-heights. The user's eyes and the
//! binary's projection matrix agree to two significant figures, which is what makes this module an
//! arithmetic problem rather than a tuning problem.
//!
//! # The law
//!
//! Hold that composition for a subject of height `H`. Two conditions, and they have one solution:
//!
//! 1. **The head lands in the same place on screen.** The head is `H - pivot` above the aim point
//!    at distance `distance`, and it projects to the same screen position when that ratio is the
//!    player's: `(H - pivot) / distance == (1.5 - 1.45) / 3.8`. Solve for the pivot ->
//!    [`Shape::pivot_height`].
//! 2. **The headroom is the same fraction of the subject.** The frame's half-height at the subject
//!    is `distance * tan(fov/2)`, so headroom-as-a-fraction-of-`H` is held only when
//!    `distance` scales with `H`: `distance = 3.8 * H / 1.5`.
//!
//! Together they are just similarity: scale the whole shot by `H / 1.5`, which puts the pivot at
//! `1.45 * H / 1.5` and reproduces every angle in the frame. Two consequences worth stating
//! because they are what make this robust rather than fitted:
//!
//! * **The FOV does not appear in the answer.** It was needed to learn *what* the vanilla framing
//!   is (1.09 heights of headroom); it is not needed to *hold* it. The patched row copies
//!   `camFovY` from the base row untouched, so whatever the FOV is, the framing follows.
//! * **The camera's PITCH does not appear either.** Angles are scale-invariant, so the shot is the
//!   player's at every pitch the player can reach -- level, orbiting overhead, or looking up from
//!   below. That is why this module writes no pitch limit; see "What it deliberately does not do".
//!
//! Condition 1 is written as the pivot solve rather than as `1.45 * H / 1.5` on purpose. The two
//! agree exactly whenever the distance follows condition 2, but the distance can be pushed off it
//! -- by the clearance floor, by the configured ceiling, by a per-creature `camera_distance_scale`
//! -- and solving the pivot against the distance that will ACTUALLY be used keeps the head on
//! screen anyway. It degrades to "the framing is wider than the player's" instead of to "the head
//! is cropped".
//!
//! # Where every anchor number comes from
//!
//! Each is a value read out of the shipped `regulation.bin` or proven in the binary, and each is
//! named with its source so the next reader can check it rather than trust this comment:
//!
//! | constant | value | source |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`PLAYER_HIT_HEIGHT`] | 1.5 | `NpcParam` row 0 (`c0000`, the player) `hitHeight` |
//! | [`PLAYER_CAM_DIST`] | 3.8 | `LockCamParam` row 0 `camDistTarget` |
//! | [`PLAYER_PIVOT`] | 1.45 | `LockCamParam` row 0 `chrOrgOffset_Y` |
//! | [`PLAYER_FOV_Y_DEG`] | 48.0 | `LockCamParam` row 0 `camFovY` |
//!
//! Read them back with `python3 scripts/er-param-read.py LockCamParam --row 0`. That
//! `camFovY` is a VERTICAL angle in DEGREES is proven, not assumed:
//! `CS::ChrExFollowCam::ApplyZoomLerp` (1.16.2 `0x1403b7560`) multiplies it by
//! `GLOBAL_DegreeToRadian` into `CSCam.fov`, and `CS::CSPersCam::ToPerspective` (`0x1403e9ac0`)
//! builds the projection as `m11 = cot(fov/2)` with `m00 = cot(fov/2) / aspectRatio` -- the extra
//! division by the aspect ratio on X is exactly what makes the stored angle the vertical one.
//!
//! # The dataset that looks like it should have decided this, and why it did not
//!
//! Joining every `NpcParam` row that names a `lockCameraParamId` onto that `LockCamParam` row
//! gives 155 hand-tuned (creature height -> camera) pairs, and fitting them yields
//! `camDistTarget ~ 3.75 * H^0.10` with `chrOrgOffset_Y` almost flat at 1.3-2.15 m across a range
//! running from 0.6 m to 42 m. Reading that as the size law would be a category error.
//!
//! Those rows describe **a 1.5 m player fighting an H-metre TARGET**, not an H-metre subject.
//! `ApplyZoomLerp` applies `chrOrgOffset_Y` to the camera's SUBJECT, and the subject in vanilla is
//! always the player -- which is exactly why the offset stays at human chest height however big
//! the thing being fought is. The row is *selected* by the target and *applied* to the subject.
//! Possession swaps the subject, so the selection side of that dataset says nothing about what we
//! need. The same objection retires the other thing that dataset appears to show, that
//! `rotRangeMinX` relaxes with size: it relaxes for a player fighting a giant, which is a
//! statement about where the player's camera may orbit, not about wearing the giant.
//!
//! What it does confirm and this module follows: `camFovY` does not move with size at all (48-50
//! across the entire range), which is why the FOV is copied from the base row and never written.
//!
//! # Checking it, over the creatures that exist rather than two picked by hand
//!
//! `scripts/er-possess-camera-framing.py` runs this law over every possessable creature's real
//! `NpcParam.hitHeight` and prints where the head lands. Over the 405 creatures in
//! `data/moveset.tbl` with a usable height (0.30 m to 59.00 m, median 2.00 m) the head sits at
//! `+0.0296` half-frames and the headroom is `1.0946` subject-heights -- the player's numbers, for
//! every one of them, at every pitch. The two exceptions are `c5472`/`c6082` Great Dragonfly,
//! 0.8 m tall and 2.0 m wide, where the clearance floor pushes the camera FURTHER out than the law
//! asks and the headroom grows to 1.35 heights. Wider is a safe direction; cropped is not.
//! [`tests::the_framing_is_the_players_for_every_size_the_game_ships`] pins that in Rust.
//!
//! # What it deliberately does NOT do
//!
//! * **It writes no pitch limit.** `rotRangeMinX` used to be lerped from -40 to -15 degrees as the
//!   subject grew, on the theory that a tall creature needs the camera to swing higher. It does
//!   not do that. The sign was measured: `ChrExFollowCam.anglesEuler.x` comes from
//!   `angleFromXZPlane` (`0x1403b0b70`), which returns `atan2(v.y, |v.xz|)` NEGATED for `v` the
//!   camera-to-target vector -- so **positive means the camera is above the subject looking
//!   down**. `applyControlMovement` (`0x1403b7be0`) clamps that angle below by `+0x258`, which is
//!   where `ApplyZoomLerp` writes `rotRangeMinX`, and above by `+0x25c`, which the constructor
//!   fixes at `0x3f9c61aa` = 1.2217 rad = **+70 degrees** and nothing else ever writes (all three
//!   fields, the same constants and the same shape, are present on the installed 1.17 build at
//!   `+0x10`: `uv run --with capstone python3 scripts/scan-struct-field-access.py --image
//!   eldenring-deobf-1.17.bin --range 0x1403b0000-0x1403c0000 --disp 0x258,0x25c,0x2d4`). So
//!   `rotRangeMinX` is the limit on how far BELOW the subject the camera may drop to look UP at
//!   it, and raising it from -40 to -15 took away a shot without buying a single degree of
//!   overhead. The lever for overhead is `+0x25c`, it is a field of the camera rather than of the
//!   row, and it needs no change because the framing is pitch-invariant. Leaving `rotRangeMinX`
//!   alone also means a map region that narrowed the pitch range keeps its narrowing through a
//!   possession.
//! * **It does not chase the model, only the physics capsule.** `hitHeight` is the capsule, and a
//!   creature whose MODEL is proportionally taller than its capsule gets proportionally less
//!   headroom. It was worth measuring how badly, so it was measured: the FLVER bounding box of
//!   every chr in the game, against that chr's `NpcParam.hitHeight`, 400 pairs
//!   (`scripts/chr-flver-bbox-census.py` + `scripts/chr-hitheight-bbox-ratio.py`). The ratio runs
//!   0.24 to 12.4 with p10 0.89 and p90 2.08 -- real scatter -- but it does **not trend with
//!   size**: the median is 1.15/1.20/1.17/1.26/1.06/1.18 across the 0-1/1-2/2-4/4-8/8-15/15+ metre
//!   buckets and the rank correlation between height and ratio is **-0.03**. That is the shape
//!   that matters here. A size-independent scatter cancels out of a ratio law's slope, so the
//!   framing does not degrade as creatures get bigger -- which is the complaint this module was
//!   written for; what is left is individual creatures off by a roughly constant factor, and a
//!   per-creature constant is exactly what `[chr.cNNNN].camera_distance_scale` is. (The bbox is
//!   itself a loose proxy -- it is the bind-pose mesh extent, wings and props included, which is
//!   why `c3670` reads 12.4 -- so that scatter is an upper bound on the real mis-framing.)
//!
//!   There is also no better scalar available. ELDEN RING has no chr-scale param in any of its 179
//!   paramdefs, and the bbox is degenerate (`FLT_MAX`, `meshCount = 0`) on eleven chrs *including
//!   `c0000`* -- so the player, the one body the whole law is anchored on, has no readable model
//!   height and there is no ratio to anchor. `hitHeight` is also what the engine's own lock-on
//!   manager uses for its search-origin height, i.e. it is the game's own answer to "how tall is
//!   this".
//! * **The mount blend.** `ApplyZoomLerp`'s second branch, taken when `ChrExFollowCam+0x488` is
//!   set, ADDS a constructor-cached delta to everything derived here and then clamps the pivot to
//!   10 m. A 59 m subject wants a 57 m pivot, so possessing a giant WHILE MOUNTED will be clamped
//!   into a wrong shot. Nobody has measured how it looks; the alternative is fighting the game's
//!   own Torrent zoom, which is worse.

// Pure arithmetic; ungated so `cargo test` proves it on the host with no game running.
