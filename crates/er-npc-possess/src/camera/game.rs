//! THE LIVE SIDE: read the creature's size, patch a free `LockCamParam` row, and point
//! `ChrExFollowCam+0x468` at it. Everything reversible, everything reversed on release.
//!
//! # It resolves no game address and installs no detour
//!
//! Same property layers 1 and 2 have and layer 3 spends exactly once. Every reach here is either a
//! DLRF-name-resolved singleton (`WorldChrMan`, `SoloParamRepository` -- build-independent by
//! construction, there is no RVA to go stale) or a struct-field offset out of
//! [`crate::camera::layout`]. There is no call, no prologue, no hook.
//!
//! It IS the first layer of this crate to write a param row, which is a different kind of write
//! from a struct field -- see `scripts/me3-dll-conflicts.toml` for why that is still co-loadable.
//!
//! # Why patching the row is the mechanism, rather than writing camera state
//!
//! `CS::ChrExFollowCam::ApplyZoomLerp` (1.17 `0x1403b7570`) runs EVERY frame from
//! `ChrExFollowCam::Update`, calls `LookupLockCamParam` afresh each time, and re-derives distance,
//! pivot height, pitch minimum, FOV and chase rate from the row it gets back. Writing the derived
//! camera state directly would be overwritten before the next frame drew; writing the ROW is read
//! by the same code every frame with no fight and no per-frame work of ours. That the lookup is
//! per-frame is also what makes the patch live: there is no load-time copy to miss.
//!
//! # The three ways this can go wrong, and what each does instead
//!
//! * **A missing row id is worse than no override.** `LookupLockCamParam` returns a NULL row for
//!   an id that is not in the table, and `ApplyZoomLerp` then does *nothing at all* -- the camera
//!   freezes at whatever it was last frame, no crash, no fallback. So the row is looked up BEFORE
//!   `+0x468` is written, and a missing one refuses.
//! * **A row somebody else uses.** Patching a row that a `NpcParam.lockCameraParamId` or
//!   `RideParam.rideCamParamId` names would move that character's camera too. The check is done
//!   against the LIVE regulation rather than a table generated offline, so a player running a
//!   regulation mod gets a refusal naming the row instead of a silently wrong camera.
//! * **A rebuilt `ChrExFollowCam`.** The constructor writes `+0x464|+0x468 = -1`, so a camera
//!   rebuilt mid-possession (a warp, a map load) would silently drop the override.
//!   [`Session::reassert`] costs one compare per frame and puts it back, the same shape as the
//!   camera-override re-assert the driver already does for `WorldChrManDbg+0xb8`.
