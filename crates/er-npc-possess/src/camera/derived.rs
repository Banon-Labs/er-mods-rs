//! The `[camera.cNNNN]` block of `er-npc-possess.derived.toml`.
//!
//! Same contract as [`crate::moveset::derived`], which owns the rest of that file: it is OUTPUT,
//! it is rewritten on every possession, and nothing reads it back. Corrections go in
//! `er-npc-possess.toml` under `[camera]` and `[chr.cNNNN].camera_distance_scale`.
//!
//! # Why the camera gets a block at all
//!
//! "The camera did not change" has half a dozen causes -- the feature is off, the build is one
//! nobody measured, the creature's `hitHeight` is zero, the row the player picked is referenced by
//! their regulation -- and from the chair they are indistinguishable. Every one of them is a
//! [`Refusal`] with a sentence next to it here. When it DID change, the block prints the height it
//! read, the row it patched, the row it copied the untouched fields from, the two numbers it
//! wrote, and -- the part a player can actually check against what they can see -- where that puts
//! the top of the creature on screen and how much room is above it.

// Pure text generation; ungated so `cargo test` proves it on the host.
