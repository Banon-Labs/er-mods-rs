//! `er_npc_possess.dll` -- the "become an NPC" mod.
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! Press the hotkey and you are the character you are looking at. `possess` is the engine; this
//! file is the shell around it -- a hot-reloadable config in the game directory, a keyboard hotkey
//! and a controller hotkey bound from it, a `FrameBegin` task that drives both, and a structured
//! line in `er-npc-possess.log` for every press saying what was requested and what happened to it.
//!
//! Layer 1 shipped everything except the possession and left [`engine`] as the seam; layer 2
//! filled that seam in and nothing above it had to change, which is the only real evidence that
//! the seam was cut in the right place.
//!
//! Layer 4 added the other half of "pick an NPC to control": [`spawn`] CREATES the creature named
//! in `[spawn]` rather than finding one the map placed, waits for it to become drivable, and takes
//! it away again afterwards. There is no residency restriction on which creature -- assets load on
//! demand and nothing on the spawn path validates the id -- so what replaces one is a deadline,
//! because a chr id with no assets does not fail, it waits forever.
//!
//! # What it touches in the game
//!
//! One recurring `FrameBegin` task and two Win32 input reads inside it, plus -- only while
//! something is possessed -- a handful of struct-field writes on two `ChrIns`. See `input` for
//! why polling rather than hooking is the smaller claim rather than the lazier one, and
//! [`possess::game`] for why the possession engine itself needed almost no addresses at all.
//!
//! It resolves **three** game function addresses and claims **one prologue**, and both numbers are
//! worth knowing because they were zero for two layers and every one of them is a thing that can
//! break on a game patch. [`moveset`] spends one address on `PlayAnimationByBehaviorName`, without
//! which no dodge in the game is reachable; [`spawn`] spends two, on creating and removing a
//! character, which are the two things that cannot be done by writing a field. The prologue is
//! `CS::CSFeManImp::UpdatePlayerComponents`, detoured by [`hud`] so the HP, FP and stamina bars
//! read the possessed creature. All four go through `game_rva_named`, so on a build with no
//! verified 1.16.2 -> 1.17 mapping the feature is REFUSED rather than jumping into whatever now
//! occupies those bytes -- `er-hook` logs `HOOK REFUSED` and the bars keep showing your own
//! character. That is the whole of this DLL's footprint in the game image; it is recorded in
//! `scripts/me3-dll-conflicts.toml`, and no other shell in the suite hooks that function or its
//! caller.
//!
//! One more hook exists and is NOT a game prologue: hudhook's DX12 `Present`, which [`picker`]
//! installs the first time the creature list is opened and never otherwise. That is a swapchain
//! vtable slot, arbitrated by `er_build_watermark_core::overlay_host` so the process keeps exactly
//! one of them however many shells want to draw.
//!
//! The one thing it does that IS dangerous is write `ChrCtrl+0x3b0`, because `ChrCtrl::Unref`
//! DLPanics on a non-null value there. Every path that can end a possession -- the hotkey, the
//! creature dying, the creature despawning, and `DLL_PROCESS_DETACH` below -- goes through
//! `possess::teardown`, which clears it whatever else failed.

// The config, settings, engine and edge-state modules are ungated on purpose: they are pure logic,
// so their tests run on the host where the windows-only game bindings do not exist.
