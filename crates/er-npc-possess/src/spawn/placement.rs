//! HOW FAR IN FRONT OF THE PLAYER A SPAWNED CREATURE GOES, once its own size is known.
//!
//! # The defect this exists to close
//!
//! `[spawn].distance_m` was the whole answer, and it is one number for every creature from a
//! Ballista to a Fallingstar Beast. Measured, from the run that produced this module: c6310's
//! physics capsule is `hitRadius` **4.00 m** (`NpcParam 63100000`, and the same value the camera
//! layer read off `CSChrPhysicsModule+0x344` that session), and `distance_m` was **3.0**. So the
//! creature was created with the player already a metre inside its own capsule. Eight other
//! possessions in that same session placed creatures whose capsules were 0.80-2.70 m tall and
//! none of them overlapped; the one that did is the one the player did not walk away from.
//!
//! # `distance_m` is now a FLOOR, not the answer
//!
//! The placed distance is `max(distance_m, creature_radius + player_radius + `[`CLEARANCE_M`]`)`,
//! so a small creature still lands exactly where the file says and a large one is pushed out until
//! its capsule clears the player's. The config file says so in the comment beside the key; a
//! player who wants a creature closer than its own body allows cannot have it, and that is the
//! point rather than a limitation.
//!
//! # Why the radius and not the height
//!
//! `hitHeight` is what the camera layer sizes itself on, because the camera cares how tall the
//! subject is. Overlap is horizontal: two capsules intersect when their centres are closer than
//! the sum of their radii, whatever their heights. `+0x344` is the field that decides it.
//!
//! # The chicken and egg, and where it is actually resolved
//!
//! A creature's `CSChrPhysicsModule` does not exist until `CSChrPhysicsModule::InitForEnemy` has
//! run, which is long after `SpawnDynamicChr` returns -- so the radius cannot be read when the
//! request is built. It does not need to be: the request's position field is not read on the
//! creature path at all (see [`crate::possess::layout::chr_spawn_request`]), and the creature is
//! actually PUT somewhere by `finish_spawn`, once it is drivable. That is 166-249 ms later on the
//! nine spawns in the reference log, and by then the capsule reads. So this arithmetic runs at
//! placement time, on the real number, and never on a guess.
//!
//! Everything here is pure, so `cargo test` proves it on the host with no game running.

// Pure arithmetic; it stays ungated so its tests run on the host.
