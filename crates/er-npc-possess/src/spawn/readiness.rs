//! WHEN A SPAWNED CREATURE MAY BE POSSESSED, and what to do when it never can be.
//!
//! # The deadline is the mod's, because the game has none
//!
//! There is no error edge and no timeout anywhere in the eight `ChrRes` states or the eleven
//! `EneDat` ones. A chr id whose `chrbnd` does not exist does not fail -- it sits in `LoadWait`
//! forever, quietly, with a `ChrIns` allocated and registered and nothing ever completing. So the
//! deadline here is not belt-and-braces around a native failure path; it is the ONLY thing that
//! ends that state, and its expiry is the one signal that says "that was a bad pick".
//!
//! Nothing is pumped while it waits: `EneDatManImp::Update` walks all sixty-four slots every frame
//! from the game's own `STEP_Update`, so the load progresses whether or not this mod looks at it.
//! Waiting is genuinely waiting.
//!
//! # The gate ORDER is a safety property, not a presentation choice
//!
//! [`Gate::ORDER`] is evaluated front to back and stops at the first one that is not satisfied.
//! That matters for [`Gate::AssetsResident`]: the predicate it mirrors, `FUN_1404ca4a0`, does not
//! null-check its `EneDat*`, and the only thing that establishes there IS an `EneDat` is
//! [`Gate::ChrResLoaded`] -- `ChrIns::GetEneDat` returns null unless the step is in `3..6`. The
//! live reader defends itself as well, but the ordering is where the contract lives and
//! [`Readiness::observe`] enforces it for every caller rather than asking each one to remember.
//!
//! # Three outcomes, and only one of them may call `RemoveChrIns`
//!
//! * [`Poll::Expired`] -- we gave up. The creature exists and is ours, so we remove it.
//! * [`Poll::Vanished`] -- the GAME removed it. `EnemyIns::InitializeCharacterRendering`
//!   self-despawns a character whose caps loaded but yielded no FLVER, and `ChrSet::RemoveChrIns`
//!   nulls the entry on its way out. Calling `RemoveChrIns` on that pointer again would hand a
//!   freed `ChrIns` to `CSDelayDeleteMan` a second time. Drop the pointer and say so.
//! * [`Poll::Ready`] -- possession may start.

// Pure state handling; ungated so `cargo test` proves it on the host with no game running.
