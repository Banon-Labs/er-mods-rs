//! The `ChrSpawnRequest` block, built byte by byte at the offsets the retail caller writes.
//!
//! # Why a byte array and not a `#[repr(C)] struct`
//!
//! A Rust struct would put the fields wherever rustc likes and the layout would then be an
//! assumption nobody could see. Here every store names its offset out of
//! [`crate::possess::layout::chr_spawn_request`], which is a transcription of
//! `CSTalkDynamicChrCtrl`'s own stack stores -- so the layout is stated once, in the table, and
//! the tests below read the block back at those same offsets.
//!
//! # The one field that cannot be filled until the block stops moving
//!
//! `model.backingString.pointer` points AT the block: at `model + MODEL_BUFFER`, thirty-two
//! `wchar_t` of inplace storage. A self-referential pointer cannot be baked into a value that is
//! about to be moved, so [`SpawnRequest::new`] leaves it zero and [`SpawnRequest::bind`] writes it
//! once the block is at the address the game will read it from. `bind` is ordinary Rust arithmetic
//! on our own memory -- no game involved -- so the test at the foot of this file proves it.

// Pure byte assembly; ungated so `cargo test` proves it on the host with no game running.
