//! THE TWO GAME FUNCTIONS THIS LAYER CALLS, and the field reads that decide when to call them.
//!
//! # Why these two and not the two the brief named
//!
//! The obvious spawn entry is `CS::ChrSet::SpawnSummonBuddy` (1.16.2 `0x140492cb0`), and it is the
//! wrong one. Its decompilation is explicit about why: it takes the slot from the CALLER, as a
//! `FieldInsHandle`, and then does
//!
//! ```text
//! uVar1 = HandleToIndex(&handle);
//! chrSetEntry = param_1->entries + (int)uVar1;      // no bound of any kind
//! if (chrSetEntry->chrIns != NULL) return chrSetEntry->chrIns;
//! ```
//!
//! -- an unchecked index into a heap array, and a silent return of SOMEBODY ELSE'S character when
//! the slot is taken. Every bound on that path would have had to be ours, on an array Seamless
//! Co-op also lives in.
//!
//! [`SPAWN_DYNAMIC_CHR_RVA`] is the entry the GAME uses for exactly this job.
//! `CSTalkDynamicChrCtrl` -- the runtime spawner behind dynamically-placed NPCs -- calls it, and it
//! forwards to `FUN_140492a90`, which opens `index = 6`, loops `while (index < 0x14)` and takes the
//! first entry whose `chrIns` is null. **The index is never ours, so there is no index of ours to
//! be wrong**, and a full band returns NULL instead of overwriting anybody. It also does the
//! registration `SpawnSummonBuddy` skips: the `ChrSet` vtable slot, the `eventEntityIdMap` insert
//! (only when the entity id is nonzero, which is why ours is zero) and `AddChrInsToGroupIdMap`.
//!
//! What is left for this module to bound is the ARRAY, because that loop consults no capacity at
//! all: see [`spawn`], which reads `chrInsCapacity` at runtime and refuses when it does not cover
//! the band the game is about to walk.
//!
//! # And the four readiness predicates, which cost no address at all
//!
//! The brief's readiness predicate is four native calls. Three of them turned out to be field reads
//! wearing a function, and the fourth is a pointer walk this crate already had:
//!
//! | brief | what it actually is |
//! |---|---|
//! | `chrSet->entries[slot].chrIns == returned` | a read, unchanged |
//! | `ChrIns::GetEneDat != NULL` | `3 <= *(i32*)(chrIns->chrRes + 0x40) < 6` |
//! | `FUN_1404ca4a0(eneDat) != NULL` | two loads and a `== 4` byte test |
//! | `chrModelIns`/`chrCtrl` non-null | [`Chr::chr_ctrl`] + [`Chr::real_manipulator`] |
//!
//! The last row is a deliberate substitution rather than a transcription. `chrCtrl` non-null is a
//! weaker statement than what possession needs and than what this crate already checks:
//! [`Chr::chr_ctrl`] additionally proves `ChrCtrl.owner` points back at the same `ChrIns`, and
//! [`Chr::real_manipulator`] proves the `ComManipulator` the thunk will forward to exists. Those
//! two are the actual preconditions for the next thing that happens. `chrModelIns` is not read
//! anywhere in this crate, so adding an offset for it -- one this session did not verify on 1.17 --
//! would have been cost with no benefit.
