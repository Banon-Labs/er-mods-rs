//! THE ONE PRESENT HOOK THIS DLL OWNS, and the two panels that draw on it.
//!
//! # Why this is its own module
//!
//! It used to be the back half of [`crate::picker::render`], which was fine while the picker was
//! the only thing this crate drew. It is not any more: the attack-set panel
//! ([`crate::moveset::banner`]) is a second surface with a completely different lifetime -- the
//! picker is up for a few seconds while you choose, the banner is up for the whole possession --
//! and it must NOT come with a second `Present` hook. Two `Hudhook::apply()` calls in one process
//! double-hook `Present` and the second one silently renders nothing, measured live on 2026-08-25,
//! and that is the entire reason `er_build_watermark_core::overlay_host` exists.
//!
//! So the host-join lives here, once, and both panels are drawn from [`draw`]. Adding a third
//! surface later means adding a call to that function and nothing else.
//!
//! # The install is LAZY, and now has two triggers
//!
//! Nothing here runs until something needs to be drawn: the first time the picker opens, or the
//! first time a possession publishes a banner. A session that does neither ends with this DLL
//! having hooked nothing at all, which is the property the crate's entry in
//! `scripts/me3-dll-conflicts.toml` is about.
//!
//! The second trigger is not a nicety. Before it existed the banner could only appear in a session
//! where the PICKER had been opened first -- and the live session of 2026-09-02 was exactly the
//! other case: `picker_overlay=false` for its whole length while `state=active` possessed a
//! creature, so an indicator gated on the picker's install would have drawn nothing at all.
//!
//! # `frames` is not `panel draws`, and the difference cost a diagnosis
//!
//! The status line used to report a counter called `picker_draws` that this module incremented on
//! every `Present` regardless of whether the picker was open, beside `picker_rows`, which is zero
//! whenever the picker is CLOSED. `picker_draws=3747 picker_rows=0` was therefore the correct
//! reading for a closed picker, and it was read as a picker that had drawn 3747 blank frames.
//! Verified against that same session's log: every status line with `picker_open=true` carried
//! `picker_rows=15`, and every line with `picker_rows=0` carried `picker_open=false` -- 611 status
//! lines, no counter-example. Nothing was broken and the counter said so; the NAME did not.
//!
//! The counters are therefore split by what they actually count: [`frames`] is Present frames this
//! module drew into, and each panel counts its own builds.
