//! `er-npc-possess.toml`, written on first run and re-read while the game runs.
//!
//! Same shape as `er-enemynpc-effects` and `er-refill-all`, for the same reasons: the file lives
//! in the game's own directory (the process CWD), the DLL writes a fully commented default the
//! first time it cannot find one, and `er_hotkey_config::HotFile` notices edits by comparing the
//! file's TEXT rather than its mtime -- mtime has one-second resolution on the filesystems a Wine
//! prefix sits on, so two saves inside a second are invisible to it, which reads as "changing the
//! key did nothing".
//!
//! # The one thing this file does that the other two do not
//!
//! **`[target]` is not live.** Everything else here takes effect on the next reload, about a
//! second after the file is saved. `[target]` decides WHO you are about to become, and moving that
//! while a possession is in flight would leave the mapping, the camera and the moveset describing
//! a different character than the body on screen. So an edit to it is STAGED: the value on disk is
//! remembered, the value IN FORCE does not move, and [`adopt_staged_target`] promotes one to the
//! other at the next possession. The log says `[target] staged` rather than `[target] now`, so
//! nobody is left believing an edit took that has not.

//! # The second file
//!
//! A later layer writes `er-npc-possess.derived.toml` -- one line per animation, auto-classified,
//! for the player to correct. It is NOT implemented here, and nothing below assumes there is only
//! one file: [`PossessConfig::apply`] takes text rather than a path, the watcher is a field rather
//! than a global, and [`DERIVED_CONFIG_FILE_NAME`] is already spelled out. Adding it is a second
//! `HotFile` in [`ConfigState`] and a second `apply`, not a rewrite.

// Windows-only crate in practice; this module is pure text handling and stays ungated so its

#
# EDITS TAKE EFFECT WHILE THE GAME RUNS. This file is re-read about once a second; there is no
# need to restart, and the log names the old value and the new one each time one moves. The one
# exception is the whole [target] table, which is explained at that table.
#
# WHAT WORKS TODAY. Press the hotkey and you BECOME the character [target] selects: the camera and
# lock-on move to it, your own body goes invisible, silent, invincible and unable to attack, and it
# is carried along with the creature every frame so other players see you standing where it stands
# and releasing drops you exactly there. The left stick walks the creature. Press again -- or let
# it die -- to get out.
#
# ATTACKING. Four buttons, the same on every creature: R1 light, R2 heavy, L1 ranged, L2 movement
# (on mouse and keyboard, the game's own default: click, shift+click, right click, shift+right
# click). Which attack you get depends on how far away the nearest enemy is and how many times you
# have pressed the button in a row -- see [mapping]. Every creature's attacks were classified
# offline; er-npc-possess.derived.toml is written each time you possess something and lists what
# that creature can do and, for anything withheld, exactly why.
#
# WHAT IS NOT WIRED YET, so you can tell a missing feature from a broken one:
#   * The `radial` binding is parsed and reported and there is no wheel to open.
#   * Range is measured to the nearest enemy, NOT to what you are locked on to.
#   * A GRAB SWINGS BUT DOES NOT GRAB. The grab itself fires -- see allow_grabs -- but ThrowParam
#     picks the victim by exact chr id, and that is the player for 189 of the game's 190 creature
#     throw rows. Your own body is the only thing the creature could grab, and possession makes it
#     invincible, which is the same flag the game checks before it will start a throw. So the
#     swing plays and nothing is caught. Dropping the invincibility is not the fix: it would let
#     the creature you are wearing throw and kill you. er-npc-possess.derived.toml marks each
#     affected move REFUSED so you can tell this apart from a move that is simply missing.
#   * Your own body stays LOCK-ON-ABLE while you are away from it. It cannot be hurt and cannot be
#     seen, so this is an oddity rather than a hazard.
#   * turn_deadzone_deg, heading_converge and root_motion_only are RESERVED. speed_scale is live.

# writes the highlighted creature into `[target]` above exactly as if you had typed
# `mode = "chr_id"` and its id yourself, and the log prints the two lines so you can paste them
# in here to keep it. Press the picker hotkey again to close without choosing.
#
# THE LIST DOES NOT OPEN WHILE YOU ARE WEARING SOMETHING, and it closes itself if a possession
# starts while it is up. That is on purpose: the possess hotkey means CHOOSE while the list is
# open and RELEASE while you are possessing, so those two states are never both true. Pick who
# to become while you are yourself; to switch, release first and then pick.
#
# The pick is STAGED, like every other `[target]` edit: it takes effect at the next possession,
# not the current one. And the file wins -- the next time you save this file, `[target]` above is
# read again and the pick is replaced. That is why the log prints the lines to paste.
#
# WHAT PICKING DOES NOT DO, TODAY: it does not summon anything. `mode = "chr_id"` looks through
# the characters ALREADY LOADED in the map for one with that id, exactly as it does when you type
# the id in by hand. Pick Malenia in Limgrave and the next press reports `no loaded enemy matches
# chr_id` in the log, because there is not one. So the list is every creature the mod KNOWS,
# which is a larger set than the creatures you can become where you happen to be standing. The
# list says what each one can do, not whether it is nearby.
#
# THE PICKER DOES NOT TAKE THESE KEYS AWAY FROM THE GAME. This DLL does not hook the game's own
# keyboard reader -- three other mods in this profile already share that one -- so it can SEE a
# keypress but cannot stop Elden Ring from also seeing it. Whether the defaults below collide with

# they do, and the log will tell you if a navigation key never fires.
