//! Where the cursor is, and what a press moves it to. No game, no catalogue, no drawing.
//!
//! # 408 rows through however many fit
//!
//! The list is long and the input is four directions, so the whole design question is how few
//! presses it takes to reach an arbitrary row. Stepping one at a time is 204 presses on average
//! and nobody would use it. The answer here is a SECOND axis on the same four buttons: up and
//! down step one row, left and right jump to the previous or next initial. The catalogue is
//! sorted by the name on screen, so "jump by initial" is the index a reader already has in their
//! head -- to reach Runebear you press right until the R rows appear and then step.
//!
//! Measured over the shipped catalogue: 24 distinct initials, the largest of them holding 60
//! creatures, so the worst case is 24 group jumps plus 60 steps and the typical one is a small
//! fraction of that. The tests below guard LOOSER bounds than those two numbers on purpose -- a
//! regenerated name table that shifts them by a few should not go red for nothing, but one that
//! collapses the alphabet into three groups should. It is also why the group axis is by NAME
//! rather than by chr-id band: the `c4xxx` band alone holds 137 creatures with nothing to aim at
//! inside it.
//!
//! # One variable, so the window cannot desync from the cursor
//!
//! A list widget usually stores a cursor AND a scroll offset, and then has to keep them
//! consistent on every operation -- which is where list widgets go wrong. Here the window is
//! DERIVED: it is centred on the cursor and clamped to the ends. There is no second variable to
//! get out of step, every operation is "move the cursor", and [`Window`] is a pure function of
//! the cursor, the length and how many rows fit.
//!
//! The visible cost is that the list slides under a stationary highlight rather than the
//! highlight moving down a stationary list. For a picker that is the better behaviour anyway: the
//! thing you are choosing stays where your eye already is.

// Pure integer logic. Ungated so `cargo test` proves the wrap, the clamp and the group jumps on
// the host.
