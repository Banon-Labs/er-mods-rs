//! Drawing the creature list.
//!
//! THE PRESENT HOOK IS NOT HERE. This module used to own the host-join as well, back when the
//! picker was the only thing this DLL drew; that half moved to [`crate::overlay`] when the
//! attack-set panel arrived, because two surfaces must share one `Present` hook and neither of
//! them should own the other's install. What is left here is the panel itself: given a live imgui
//! frame, paint the list if it is open.
//!
//! # `PANEL_DRAWS` and the reading it exists to prevent
//!
//! [`draw`] is called on EVERY frame and returns immediately when the list is closed, which is
//! almost all of them. The counter therefore has to be incremented AFTER that early return, or it
//! measures the swapchain rather than the picker -- which is exactly the confusion that made a
//! working picker look broken for a day. See the module docs of [`crate::overlay`] for the log
//! evidence.
