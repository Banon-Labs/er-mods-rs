//! THE PICKER -- choosing which creature you are about to become, from inside the game.
//!
//! # What it is for
//!
//! Until this layer the only way to name a creature was the `chr_id` key in
//! `er-npc-possess.toml`. That works, it hot-reloads, and it is genuinely a picker -- but it is
//! one you drive by alt-tabbing to a text editor and typing a four-digit number you have to know
//! in advance. This layer puts the same choice on screen: a list of all 408 creatures the moveset
//! table covers, by NAME, with what each can do, driven by the keyboard, and it stages exactly
//! what the `chr_id` key would have staged. The TOML path is unchanged and still works.
//!
//! # WHY IT IS NOT ON THE GAME'S OWN `05_010_ProfileSelect` LIST
//!
//! That was the recommended host, it is the one native widget in the game built for a long
//! scrolling list with per-row text, and this repo already drives it. It is still the wrong host
//! for THIS feature, on three independent counts, each of which is fatal on its own:
//!
//! 1. **Its prologues are already claimed, with bare hooks.** `er-quickload` detours the
//!    ProfileSelect list builder (`0x875590`), the row-populate (`0x8757e0`), the row-model build
//!    (`0x8752c0`), `MenuItemList::SetCursor` (`0x73bc10`) and the pointer hit test (`0x736c90`)
//!    through `MhHook::new` -- a private MinHook instance, not the `er-hook` union. A second DLL
//!    claiming any of them overwrites the first one's trampoline and the loser goes silent with
//!    no error: measured on 2026-08-23 as `file_open_hits = 0` for an entire session with every
//!    GFx swap the product owns inert and nothing logged by anybody.
//! 2. **The widget the recommendation describes does not exist in the vanilla movie.** The
//!    ten-row compact list, the drive strip and the per-row stat fields are produced by
//!    `er_gfx::title_05_010::stats_panel`, a runtime edit `er-quickload` serves in place of
//!    `05_010_profileselect.gfx` and then validates against a pinned length and FNV. Two DLLs
//!    cannot both substitute one file for one URL.
//! 3. **It cannot be opened from gameplay.** It is reached from a cloned System>Quit row, which
//!    needs a live `PropertyEditDialog` and its action object. The ask here was a HOTKEY, pressed
//!    while looking at the thing you want to become; a picker that requires quitting to the
//!    system menu first is a different feature.
//!
//! So the ten-slot list is not a constraint this layer had to solve -- it is a constraint it does
//! not inherit. The overlay draws as many rows as `[picker] visible_rows` asks for, and the
//! traversal problem that remains (408 rows, four directions) is solved in [`model`] by making
//! left and right jump between initials.
//!
//! # Where it draws instead
//!
//! `er_build_watermark_core::overlay_host` -- the process's single imgui context, the same
//! surface `er-invasion-path` and `er-net-effects` draw on. This module HOSTS it if nothing else
//! has, and registers a guest callback otherwise; either way there is exactly one `Present` hook
//! in the process, which is the whole reason that arbitration exists. It costs no game function
//! address and claims no game prologue.
//!
//! # What it cannot do, stated rather than discovered
//!
//! **It does not take input away from the game.** The keys that drive it also reach Elden Ring,
//! because suppressing them means claiming the DirectInput `GetDeviceState` prologue that three
//! other shells in this profile already share -- the exact collision
//! `scripts/me3-dll-conflicts.toml` exists to prevent, and a claim this layer deliberately does
//! not make. The shipped defaults are F10 plus the four arrow keys, and every pad binding ships
//! EMPTY -- a judgement about where a collision is least likely rather than a reading of the
//! game's binding table, which is why all of them are rebindable while the game runs. A key that
//! never fires is reported rather than left silent; see [`crate::settings::PickerSettings`].
//!
//! **It does not summon anything.** Choosing writes `[target] mode = "chr_id"`, and that mode
//! searches the characters ALREADY LOADED in the map -- `possess::game` reports `no loaded enemy
//! matches chr_id` when there is none. So the list is every creature the MOD knows, which is a
//! larger set than the creatures you can become where you are standing. That gap closes when the
//! spawn layer lands; until then the honest statement is this one, and it is also in the shipped
//! config file where a player will read it before they blame the picker.
//!
//! **Nothing here is runtime-proven.** The game has not been launched against this code. The
//! catalogue, the navigation and the staging are covered by host tests; the draw is not, and
//! "the panel appears on screen" is not something a `cargo test` can assert.
//!
//! # The four parts
//!
//! * [`catalog`] -- the 408 rows, names joined onto move counts, built once on the first open.
//! * [`model`] -- where the cursor is and what a press moves it to. Pure.
//! * [`render`] -- the imgui panel, and joining the process's overlay. Windows only.
//! * this file -- the edge latches, the open/closed state, and the one line of the seam that
//!   turns a confirm into a staged `[target]`.

// The catalogue, the model and the edge/repeat logic are pure and stay ungated so `cargo test`
// proves them on the host, where none of the game bindings exist.
