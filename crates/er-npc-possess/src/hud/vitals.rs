//! THE ARITHMETIC, with no game in the room.
//!
//! Eight values come out of the possessed creature's `CSChrDataModule` and eight go into the
//! HUD's `FrontEndViewValues`. Six of those are a straight copy; two are computed, and both
//! computations are transcribed from the game's own instructions rather than invented here. That
//! transcription is the whole of this module, which is why it is a pure function over a plain
//! struct and is tested on the host.
//!
//! # The two computed fields, and where they come from
//!
//! `UpdatePlayerComponents` does not read `maxRecoverableHp` or `hpMax` out of the data module --
//! it CALLS for them. Both callees are two-instruction leaves, byte-identical in 1.16.2 and 1.17,
//! so this crate performs the loads instead of resolving two more game addresses:
//!
//! | callee | 1.16.2 | 1.17 | whole body |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `GetMaxRecoverableHp` | `0x140437280` | `0x1404377e0` | `cvttss2si eax,[rcx+0x160]` ; `add eax,[rcx+0x138]` ; `ret` |
//! | `GethpMaxUncapped` | `0x1404372c0` | `0x140437820` | `mov eax,[rcx+0x140]` ; `ret` |
//!
//! That keeps the mod's address budget where layer 3 left it: one resolved function, and it is
//! not one of these.
//!
//! # `hpMax` is a DEFICIT
//!
//! The single most misreadable thing here. The game computes the view's `hpMax` as
//! `GethpMaxUncapped(data) - data.hpMax`, i.e. **uncapped minus capped** -- how much maximum HP
//! has been taken away, which the HUD draws as the darkened tail of the bar. The bar's WIDTH is
//! `hpMaxUncapped`. On a character with no reduction the two are equal and the field is zero.
//! For a possessed creature they are equal too, because `FUN_140438a50` writes both from the same
//! `NpcParam.hp`, so a boss shows a full undarkened bar. Reproducing the subtraction faithfully is
//! what makes that come out right; "fixing" it to report the max would darken the whole bar.
//!
//! # Creatures have stamina and do not have FP
//!
//! Measured against the shipped 1.17 `regulation.bin`, all 7,045 `NpcParam` rows:
//!
//! * `stamina` (`NpcParam+0xf4`) is **> 1 on 7,043 of them** -- 50 for most bosses, 100 for
//!   Gideon, 150 for the Grafted Scion. The two exceptions are degenerate rows with `hp == 0`.
//!   The stamina bar is therefore real, and it MOVES: `FUN_1404016d0` tops stamina up every frame
//!   from the character's own `GetStaminaRecoverySpeed`, and `EnemyIns::Update` calls it with no
//!   player gate at all.
//! * `mp` (`NpcParam+0x28`, the source of `fpMax`) is **0 on 6,989 of them** and on every boss
//!   checked. The 56 rows with any FP are almost all merchants. So the FP bar has nothing to show
//!   for essentially anything worth possessing.
//!
//! Note what that corrects: `CSChrDataModule`'s constructor defaults these to **1**, but
//! `FUN_140438a50` OVERWRITES that with the param, so the real reading for a creature is `0`, not
//! `1`. [`EMPTY_POOL_MAX`] is the threshold rather than an equality test precisely so both the
//! constructor default and the param zero are caught by one rule.
//!
//! # What an empty pool is turned into, and why not zero
//!
//! An empty pool is rendered as **`0` current out of a max clamped up to 1** -- an EMPTY bar.
//! The two rejected alternatives:
//!
//! * Passing `1/1` through unchanged draws a full one-point bar, which reads as a bug rather than
//!   as an absence.
//! * Writing `0/0` is the honest value and is not safe to write. `UpdatePlayerComponents` only
//!   ever runs on the main player, whose `fpMax` is never zero, so every consumer downstream of
//!   this field is untested at zero -- and an integer `fp * width / fpMax` in any of them is a
//!   `#DE` rather than a wrong pixel. Nothing in this repo can rule that out without running the
//!   game, and a bar that looks empty is strictly better than a divide fault.

// Pure; ungated so `cargo test` proves it on the host with no game running.
