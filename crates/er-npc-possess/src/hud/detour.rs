//! THE CRATE'S FIRST AND ONLY DETOUR, and everything that follows from that.
//!
//! Layers 1 and 2 install no hook at all and layer 3 spends exactly one resolved address on a
//! CALL. This layer writes five bytes into the game image, which is a different order of claim,
//! so the reasoning is written down here rather than assumed.
//!
//! # What is hooked, and why it is the right seam
//!
//! `CS::CSFeManImp::UpdatePlayerComponents` -- 1.16.2 `0x140772a80`, 1.17 `0x140773900` -- is the
//! per-frame pass that fills the HUD's `FrontEndViewValues` from the local player. It reads the
//! RAW `WorldChrManImp+0x1e508` exactly once, into `r12`, and carries it through all 1,366
//! instructions; `WorldChrManDbg+0xb8 camOverrideChrIns` (which is how possession moves the
//! camera) is not consulted, so without this the bars keep showing the abandoned body.
//!
//! The detour calls the original **unchanged** and then overwrites eight ints. That ordering is
//! the entire design:
//!
//! * Runes, equipment, the great rune and the spell slots come from `PlayerGameData`
//!   (vtable `+0x168`) and `GetWeaponGaitemHandleBySlot` (vtable `+0x230`) during the original
//!   call, and are never touched afterwards -- so they keep reading the real player, which is
//!   what a creature cannot supply. An `EnemyIns` returns 0 from `+0x230` and its `GetChrAsm`
//!   slots answer 0, so retargeting the WHOLE function would empty the armament HUD.
//! * The post-pass calls no game code and dereferences one pointer chain the engine itself walks
//!   (`ChrIns+0x190` -> `+0x00`), so there is no vtable dispatch on a creature and nothing that
//!   could reach `CSSessionManager` voice chat or the quickmatch manager the way a swapped
//!   `r12` would.
//! * Nothing here goes near `IsMainPlayerIns`, which is what gates every save write. The
//!   dangerous `+0x1e508` readers -- `UpdateSaveRelatedData`, `AddOrRemoveItem`, `RevivePlayer`,
//!   `UploadPcInfo` and the rest -- are not on this path and must stay off it.
//!
//! LAST WRITE WINS, and that is checked rather than hoped: all eleven later `Update*` passes in
//! `CSFeManImp::Update` were disassembled, and every write they make to `[reg+0x84/88/8c/90/98/
//! a4/ac/b8]` is RSP/RBP-relative stack, never a `CSFeManImp`.
//!
//! # The signature has a FLOAT in it, which rules out the hook union
//!
//! `void UpdatePlayerComponents(CSFeManImp* this /*rcx*/, float deltaTime /*xmm1*/)` -- Ghidra's
//! recovered signature, and independently visible in the prologue (`movaps xmm6,xmm1` at
//! +0x41, feeding a `subss` against a global accumulator) and at the call site (`movaps
//! xmm1,xmm6` before every call). `er_hook::register_shared_hook` takes a `UnionFn`, four
//! `usize`s, and its own docs say "Not for float-arg or >4-stack-arg targets": routing through it
//! would let the compiler clobber `xmm1` before the trampoline ran, feeding the HUD's timing
//! accumulator garbage. So this is a bare [`MhHook`] with a correctly typed detour, and the
//! address is recorded in `scripts/me3-dll-conflicts.toml` as unshared so that a second DLL
//! arriving on this prologue is a gate failure rather than a silently dropped hook.
//!
//! (The call site also loads `r8`, which is NOT a third parameter -- every `r8` touch in the
//! body is a destination. It is dead setup shared with the sibling call above it.)
//!
//! # Inert unless something is possessed
//!
//! [`TARGET`] is zero whenever no possession is running, and the detour's whole body in that case
//! is: call the original, load one atomic, return. Nothing is read, nothing is written, and the
//! cost is a relaxed load on a function that was already running every frame.
