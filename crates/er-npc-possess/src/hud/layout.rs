//! THE TWO STRUCTS THE HUD RETARGET TOUCHES, AND THE BUILD GATE IN FRONT OF THEM.
//!
//! # Why this is a second offset table and not more rows in `possess::layout`
//!
//! `possess::layout` describes what the POSSESSION engine writes: `ChrCtrl`, the manipulator
//! override, the neuter flags. This describes what the HUD post-pass READS and where it puts the
//! answer. They are separate questions with separate evidence, and the one field they have in
//! common -- `CSChrDataModule.hp` -- is asserted equal to its counterpart there by a test below,
//! so the duplication cannot drift into a disagreement without failing.
//!
//! # The offsets did not move between the two builds, and that is measured rather than assumed
//!
//! Every constant here was read out of BOTH `eldenring-deobf.bin` (1.16.2) and
//! `eldenring-deobf-1.17.bin` (1.17) at the corresponding site inside
//! `CSFeManImp::UpdatePlayerComponents`, and the two disassemblies agree instruction for
//! instruction across the whole vitals span -- 1.16.2 `0x140772b83..c4d`, 1.17
//! `0x140773a03..acd`. A SECOND, INDEPENDENT WITNESS agrees:
//! `scripts/re117_module_field_scan.py` sweeps every `componentContainer+0x190` ->
//! `module+0x00` -> `[module+disp]` chain in both flat images and finds the same six
//! data-module offsets in both with IDENTICAL site counts -- `+0x138` 47/47, `+0x13c` 15/15,
//! `+0x148` 11/11, `+0x14c` 11/11, `+0x154` 11/11, `+0x158` 8/8.
//!
//! Read that for what it is: corroboration that the LAYOUT did not shift, not proof of any
//! individual site. Identical counts would also survive a renumbering that happened to preserve
//! them. The per-site proof is the disassembly of the vitals span above, plus the compile-time
//! `offset_of!` cross-check in `crate::hud::detour` against `fromsoftware-rs`'s separately
//! derived `CSChrDataModule`.
//!
//! **That is not a licence to skip the gate.** `ChrIns` grew eight bytes at `+0x3b8` on 1.17 with
//! its size unchanged, so a stale offset on this game reads the NEIGHBOURING FIELD instead of
//! faulting -- there is no crash to notice. [`Layout::for_build`] therefore answers `None` on any
//! build nobody has measured, and the detour is not installed at all rather than installed with
//! offsets whose provenance is "they were the same last time".
//!
//! # Provenance of the names
//!
//! Not inferred from position. Both structures are curated in the 1.16.2 named Ghidra dump and
//! every field below was taken from `getStructure` by NAME:
//! `FrontEndViewValues` (`playerHp`, `maxRecoverableHp`, `hpMax`, `hpMaxUncapped`, `fp`, `fpMax`,
//! `stamina`, `staminaMax`) and `CSChrDataModule` (`hp`, `hpMax`, `hpMaxUncapped`, `fp`, `fpMax`,
//! `stamina`, `staminaMax`, `recoverableHpLeft`). `CSChrDataModule`'s names independently agree
//! with `fromsoftware-rs`'s model of the same struct, which is asserted in `hud::detour`.

// Pure arithmetic and constants; ungated so the tests below run on the host.
