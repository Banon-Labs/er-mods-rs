//! Reading the two hotkeys, and the edge state that turns "held" into "pressed once".
//!
//! # Why this polls instead of hooking
//!
//! `er-enemynpc-effects` detours `IDirectInputDevice8::GetDeviceState` because it needs to SUPPRESS
//! the trigger key -- blanking the byte so the game does not also act on it. This DLL does not
//! suppress anything, so it takes the cheaper path `er-refill-all` already proved: poll
//! `GetAsyncKeyState` and `XInputGetState` from the game's own FrameBegin task.
//!
//! That is not a shortcut, it is the smaller claim. Three DLLs already detour that one
//! `GetDeviceState` slot through the shared hook union, and a fourth claimant would need a
//! `[[shared]]` row in `scripts/me3-dll-conflicts.toml`, a union-shaped handler and a proof that it
//! chains rather than installing a second MinHook instance on the same prologue -- the exact
//! configuration that cost this repo a full day when two DLLs did it accidentally. Layer 1 needs
//! none of that to know a key was pressed. If a later layer needs to STEAL an input from the game
//! rather than merely observe it, that is when the detour is earned, and it must go through
//! `er_hook::register_shared_hook` with a row in that table.
//!
//! The thread matters: `GetAsyncKeyState`'s low bit is "pressed since the previous call ON THIS
//! THREAD", and under Wine/Proton it only reports reliably from the thread the game itself polls
//! on. FrameBegin is that thread.

// Windows-only crate in practice; the edge state below is pure logic and stays ungated so its
// tests run on the host.
