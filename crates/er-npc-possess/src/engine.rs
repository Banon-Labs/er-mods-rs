//! THE SEAM. Everything that will actually possess a character plugs in here.
//!
//! Stack layer 1 ships the config file, the hotkeys and this module, and nothing else. There is no
//! possession engine yet -- the reverse engineering it needs (which `ChrIns` field owns the input
//! the AI reads, how a `TimeAct` is driven from outside the behaviour graph, where the camera's
//! follow target lives) is later layers' work. So this module defines the shape of that engine and
//! ships a [`NullEngine`] that refuses politely, rather than inventing a mechanism now and having
//! to unpick it.
//!
//! # Who calls what
//!
//! * **The frame task calls [`on_hotkey_edge`]**, once per rising edge of the possess hotkey --
//!   see `crate::tick`. It drives the state machine and forwards to whichever engine is installed.
//! * **A later layer calls [`install_engine`]**, once, from its own init before the first frame.
//!   That is the ONLY thing a later layer has to do to take over: nothing in this crate's config,
//!   input or logging path changes when a real engine arrives.
//! * **Nothing calls [`PossessionEngine`] directly.** It is behind the state machine on purpose,
//!   because "the player pressed the key" and "we are now possessing something" are different
//!   facts and the failure mode worth designing against is treating them as one.
//!
//! # Why `accepts_reload` is on the engine and not on the config
//!
//! A config reload must never land mid-animation: the mapping tables are read while an attack is
//! playing, and swapping them under it would finish one character's swing with another's. Only the
//! engine knows whether the possessed body is in a neutral state, so it -- not the file poller --
//! decides when a reload may be consumed. Layer 1's engine has no animation state and always says
//! yes; the gate is wired up NOW so a later layer only has to answer the question, not also find
//! the place to ask it. `crate::tick` is the caller.

// Windows-only crate in practice; this module is pure state handling and stays ungated so its
// tests run on the host.
