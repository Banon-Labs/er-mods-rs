//! THE FALL BOOKKEEPING OF A BODY THAT IS BEING CARRIED, and the one clamp that makes it safe at
//! every subject size.
//!
//! # The arithmetic the engine actually kills on
//!
//! `CS::CSChrFallModule::GetFallDeathTime` (1.16.2 `0x14044dce0`, the `SUBSS` at `0x14044dd1f`)
//! is one subtraction:
//!
//! ```text
//! fallHeight = physics->lastGroundedPosition.y - CSChrPhysicsModule::GetPosition(physics).y
//! ```
//!
//! and its caller `CSChrFallModule::Update` (`0x14044df00`) evaluates it ONLY on a frame where
//! `physics->standingOnSolidGround` is set and `IsSliding` is false -- i.e. on the frame the body
//! LANDS -- then charges `hpMax * ratio(fallHeight)` through `CSChrDataModule::ChangeHP` and
//! stamps `serverLogDataTracker->deathType = Fall`.
//!
//! Two facts follow, and this module exists because of the second one.
//!
//! **The invincibility bit DOES cover it, contrary to what this crate used to say.** The damage
//! block is gated on `FUN_14044e730`, whose tail is byte-read here rather than guessed
//! (`0x14044e79a` is `XOR EAX,EAX; RET`, `0x14044e8f1` is `MOV AL,1; RET`):
//!
//! ```text
//! 14044e866  MOV RCX,RAX ; MOV R9,[RAX] ; CALL [R9+0x1d8]   ; ChrIns::IsImmuneToAttack
//! 14044e873  TEST AL,AL ; JNZ 14044e79a                     ; immune -> return FALSE
//! 14044e88d  CMPL $0x0,0x138(RAX) ; JLE 14044e79a           ; hp <= 0 -> return FALSE
//! 14044e8a5  CALL 0x1403f4510 ; TEST AL,AL ; JNZ 14044e79a  ; IsDead -> return FALSE
//! 14044e8e4  CALL 0x140454be0 ; TEST AL,AL ; JZ  14044e79a  ; material+0x1B clear -> return FALSE
//! ```
//!
//! So a body carrying `chrFlags1c5 & 0x10` cannot be charged for a fall at all. (`0x140454be0` is
//! `MOVZBL 0x1b(RCX),EAX; RET` and `0x140454c00` is `MOV DL -> 0x1b(RCX); RET`: the byte at
//! `CSChrMaterialModule+0x1B` must be SET for fall damage to apply, so it enables rather than
//! disables it, whatever the accessor is named.)
//!
//! **Which is exactly why the exposure is at the EDGES.** The bit is only on while the possession
//! is running. Release takes it off, and the frames after that are ordinary mortal frames in which
//! `lastGroundedPosition` is still whatever the possession left behind. If the body has ended up
//! below the point the co-location was writing -- and it can, because the body keeps its own
//! full-size character proxy and `ChrCtrl::updatePos` runs a complete `CSChrPhysicsModule::doUpdates`
//! immediately AFTER draining our teleport -- then the difference above is a fall the body never
//! took, and it is charged the moment the body next touches ground.
//!
//! # The clamp
//!
//! [`grounded_pin`] writes `lastGroundedPosition` at the co-location target, but never ABOVE where
//! the body actually is. That makes `lastGroundedPosition.y - position.y` non-positive by
//! construction, at any subject size, on any frame, through any release path -- including the one
//! where the final `request_move` fails outright and the body is left exactly where the physics
//! put it. It is not a tuned number: it is the same subtraction the engine performs, arranged so
//! its result cannot be a lie.
//!
//! It is also not a lie in the other direction. The field means "the last place this character
//! stood", and a body that has been pushed below the creature it is riding is standing lower than
//! the creature, not higher. Pinning it to the creature's height is the fiction; pinning it to the
//! body's own is the fact.
//!
//! # Why the alarm threshold is read from the character
//!
//! [`drift_alarm_m`] answers "how far below the co-location target does the body have to be before
//! the log should shout about it". The engine's own two candidates are used, in order: the body's
//! `CSChrPhysicsModule+0x104 maxStepHeight` -- the height it can walk up without it counting as
//! anything -- and, when that does not read, the `0.3` at `0x14329e658` that `CSChrFallModule::Update`
//! compares `fallHeight` against before it notifies the manipulator that a landing happened
//! (`COMISS XMM6,[0x14329e658]` at `0x14044e11b`). Both are the game's numbers. Neither came from
//! a creature this mod happened to be possessing when somebody died.

// Pure arithmetic; ungated so its tests run on the host with no game running.
