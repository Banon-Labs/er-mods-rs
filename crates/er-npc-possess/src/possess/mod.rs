//! THE POSSESSION ENGINE -- stack layer 2, the thing layer 1's seam was cut for, plus the
//! moveset layer that filled its own.
//!
//! # What actually happens when the key is pressed
//!
//! 1. A `thunk::Thunk` is built: one page holding a 55-slot vtable whose stubs swap `rcx` to the
//!    creature's real `ComManipulator` and tail-jump, except `[vt+0x48]` (`UpdateAi`, no-oped --
//!    this is the feature) and `[vt+0x08]` (the scalar deleting destructor, which must never run
//!    with a swapped `rcx` or it frees the creature's real manipulator).
//! 2. That object's address goes into `ChrCtrl+0x3b0`, the dormant manipulator override slot.
//!    Three dispatchers check it before `ChrCtrl+0x18`, so the creature's think path dies and its
//!    execute path is untouched.
//! 3. The creature goes into `WorldChrManDbg+0xb8 camOverrideChrIns`. Camera and lock-on follow it
//!    for free; identity, damage and the save keep pointing at the real `PlayerIns`. What follows
//!    for free is the camera's AIM, not its SHAPE -- [`crate::camera`] sizes the framing to the
//!    body being worn, because vanilla's is cut for a 1.8 m Tarnished.
//! 4. The player's own body is neutered -- invincible, alpha 0, silent, `debugFlags |= noAttack`
//!    -- and co-located with the creature every frame through the engine's own proxy drain.
//! 5. Every frame after that, movement intent is written into the creature's `AiIns`.
//! 6. The four face inputs fire that creature's own attacks -- see [`crate::moveset`], which fills
//!    the seam this module's docs used to name. It costs no game address either: firing is a
//!    write to `CSChrEventModule+0x18 requestAnimationId`.
//!
//! # The two things this layer does NOT do, named so nobody has to go looking
//!
//! * **Untargetable.** `IsLockOnDisabled` reads `ChrCtrl+0xc8 -> +0x8 -> +0x10 actionFlags` bit 3,
//!   which lives in the SpEffect-accumulated modifier block and is re-derived every frame. A raw
//!   write is undone before it is read; the supported route is a SpEffect row, which this layer
//!   does not have. The player's body is invisible, silent and invincible, so a hostile that locks
//!   onto it is a cosmetic oddity rather than a hazard.
//!
//!   **What this layer DOES now do is make the body the wrong TEAM to be a candidate**, which is
//!   a different mechanism reaching the same place and is one byte. The lock-on scan's filter is
//!   `CanTargetTeamType(subject, candidate) && candidate != subject`, and possession made the
//!   creature the subject -- so with the creature on its own hostile team the only opposing
//!   character in the world was the player's own co-located body, and real enemies were FRIENDS
//!   it could not lock onto. Writing `ChrIns+0x6c teamType = Charmed` on the worn creature
//!   inverts both halves. [`body_size`] stays as the FALLBACK for when that write does not take
//!   (an unreadable byte, or a network `TemporaryTeamType` slot that outranks it): then the body
//!   is still the nearest legal target and the reticle still needs to land on the creature's head
//!   rather than under its feet.
//! * **Save suppression.** [`teardown::Step::LiftSaveSuppression`] exists and runs last, and it
//!   it lifts nothing, because nothing is suppressed: co-location means the real `PlayerIns` is
//!   genuinely standing where the creature is, so `UpdateSafePosition` writing the save's respawn
//!   fields from that position is CORRECT rather than something to hold off. The step is kept
//!   because the ordering constraint is real the moment anything ever does suppress.

// The offset table, the thunk emitter, the teardown ordering and the movement math are pure and
// stay ungated, so `cargo test` proves them on the host with no game running. `game` and the
// engine that drives them touch live memory through the windows-only `eldenring` bindings.
