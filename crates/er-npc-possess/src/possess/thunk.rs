//! THE VTABLE SWIZZLE: one slot of the creature's own `ComManipulator` vtable replaced, on a
//! patched copy of that table, so its brain stops running and nothing else about it changes.
//!
//! # What it is for
//!
//! `[vt+0x48]` is `if (aiIns && ShouldUpdateAi) AiIns::Update(aiIns, dt)` and nothing else -- goal
//! selection, target acquisition, path replanning, AI timers. `[vt+0x50]` is the per-frame tick
//! that runs `AiIns::UpdateMovement` and turns `walkType`/`wantToMoveTo` into a published move
//! vector. **Think** and **execute** live in two different slots, so no-oping one and leaving the
//! other alone buys AI-free locomotion with no other change. Damage, animation and physics are not
//! in the manipulator at all; they hang off `ChrIns::Update`, which is untouched.
//!
//! Only slot `+0x48` differs from the creature's own table. Every other entry is copied verbatim,
//! which is what makes the swizzle invisible to the rest of the engine.
//!
//! # WHY THIS REPLACED THE `ChrCtrl+0x3b0` OVERRIDE, MEASURED 2026-09-02
//!
//! The previous design put a separate 55-slot object in `ChrCtrl+0x3b0` -- a manipulator OVERRIDE
//! slot retail never writes -- whose stubs swapped `rcx` to the real `ComManipulator` and
//! tail-jumped. Dispatch worked. The problem was that the engine does not only DISPATCH through
//! that slot: fourteen sites resolve `chrManipulator ?? manipulator` and then use the answer as an
//! OBJECT. Enumerate them with `find-deobf-field-access.py 0x3b0`.
//!
//! The publish and the consume are a matched pair, and the `rcx` swap put them on opposite sides:
//!
//! ```text
//! publish:  FUN_1403cdc20(manip, vec)   writes ChrManipulator +0x10 AND +0x70
//! consume:  FUN_1403cd770(manip, out)   MOVUPS XMM0,[RCX+0x10] ; MOVAPS [RDX],XMM0 ; RET
//! caller:   FUN_1403cbff0(ChrCtrl*)     resolves chrManipulator ?? manipulator,
//!                                       then calls FUN_1403cd770 on the result
//! ```
//!
//! So `[vt+0x50]` published into the REAL object while the consumer read the OVERRIDE's zeroes.
//! `FUN_1403cd4c0`, called on the same pointer two lines later, reads `+0x20`..`+0x50` and was
//! starved identically. Runtime telemetry: `staged == published` on the real object with the body
//! frozen to five decimals.
//!
//! One object cannot diverge from itself. Swizzling the real manipulator's vptr keeps every field
//! read and every field write on the same object, and `ChrCtrl+0x3b0` is left NULL -- which also
//! retires the `ChrCtrl::Unref` DLPanic that the old teardown had to sequence around.
//!
//! # Why 55 slots
//!
//! `0x1B8` bytes, agreed by three independent oracles: an `.rdata` COL-boundary scan measuring
//! every one of the eight manipulator vtables at exactly `0x1b8`; Ghidra's curated
//! `ChrManipulator_vtable` struct at 55 fields / 440 bytes; and both game images separately. The
//! copy must be the full length or the engine reads past its end -- an under-sized table is not a
//! smaller feature, it is a shipped crash on whichever slot nobody happened to exercise.
//!
//! # Why the RTTI pointer is copied too
//!
//! MSVC puts the `CompleteObjectLocator` at `vptr[-1]`, and `dynamic_cast` and the
//! `GetRuntimeClassMetadata` paths read it by walking BACKWARDS off the vtable pointer. A copy
//! that started at slot 0 would leave those reads looking at whatever precedes our allocation, so
//! the page holds that pointer first and the address we hand out is one slot past it.
//!
//! # The one ordering that is a crash
//!
//! The page is ours; the OBJECT is the game's. While the swizzle is installed the creature's
//! manipulator holds a pointer INTO this page, so the original vptr must go back before the page
//! is freed and before the creature is destroyed. `crate::possess::teardown` sequences that, and
//! `Step::RestoreManipulatorVtable` is the step whose failure is treated as unrecoverable.
//!
// The emitter below is pure byte arithmetic and stays ungated so its tests run on the host; the
// allocation and install half is `#[cfg(windows)]`.
