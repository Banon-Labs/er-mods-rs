//! WHY THE LOCK-ON RETICLE SAT AT THE CREATURE'S FEET, and the one number that moves it.
//!
//! # What the reticle is actually on
//!
//! Not the creature. **The player's own body**, and that is settled rather than suspected.
//!
//! `WorldChrManDbg+0xb8 camOverrideChrIns` makes the possessed creature the lock-on *subject*:
//! `LockTgtMan`'s per-frame update (1.16.2 `FUN_140716260`, 1.17 `0x1407170b0`) opens by calling
//! `WorldChrManImp::GetMainPlayerIns` (1.16.2 `0x140507ff0`), which returns the override when one
//! is set and only falls back to the raw `+0x1e508 mainPlayerIns`. So every candidate the search
//! considers is measured against the CREATURE -- and the one self-test in the whole scan is
//! `CMP R14,R15` at 1.16.2 `0x1407166e3`, raw pointer identity against that same overridden
//! pointer. The real `PlayerIns` is a different pointer, so it is not excluded. It is standing
//! exactly where the creature is (this engine puts it there every frame), it is still
//! lock-on-able on purpose, and it is therefore the nearest legal target in the world.
//!
//! That is what the player is locking onto, which is why the reticle appeared at their feet: it
//! was drawn on a 1.5 m body at the bottom of a 12 m dragon.
//!
//! # Why the reticle CANNOT be moved directly
//!
//! Its world position is a **dummy polygon on the target's model**. `CS::ChrSlotSys::AddActPntSlot`
//! (`0x140499980`) registers each character's lock points over the dummy-id range `0xdc..0xe4`
//! (220..228), selected per character by `NpcParam.lockGazePoint0..7`; `FUN_14049ce50` resolves
//! each one through `ChrIns::GetDmypolyPosition` and caches the result at `ActPntNode+0x00`; and
//! `FUN_140716260` copies that vector into the subject's `ChrIns+0xd0 lockOnTargetPos`. There is
//! no per-character "lock point offset" field anywhere in that chain -- the ONE offset field in
//! the neighbourhood, `ChrCtrl+0x1a0 lockOnTagOffset`, is added by
//! `CS::CSFeManImp::UpdateChrEnemyTagEntries` (`0x140776a30`) to the **name/HP tag**, which uses
//! dummy 210 (`MOV dword ptr [RSP+0x20],0xd2` at `0x140776c58`) and is a different surface.
//!
//! So the only way to move the anchor is to move the model the dummy is attached to.
//!
//! # The lever: the body wears the creature's height
//!
//! `CS::ChrCtrl::RecalculateChrMatrix` builds `ChrCtrl.modelMatrix` from the physics matrix,
//! `verticalPositionOffset` and `scaleSize{X,Y,Z}`, and then copies that matrix straight into
//! `locationMtx44ChrEntity->mtx` -- the root of the location tree that
//! `GetLocationMdlDmypolyModifier` resolves dummies against. Scale the body and every dummy on it
//! moves with it, the lock-gaze points included. Only `Y` is written; see [`worn_scale`] for why
//! the other two would be cost without benefit.
//!
//! Of the two inputs, **scale is the one that holds**. `verticalPositionOffset` is recomputed
//! every frame by `FUN_1403cbc50` -- `verticalPositionOffset = offsetY` (from
//! `NpcParam.hitYOffset`) and then `+= footIkCorrection` -- so a write to it survives until the
//! next frame at best. `scaleSize` has exactly two writers in the whole character range: the
//! `ChrCtrl` constructor's `1.0` init and `ChrCtrl::SetScaleSize`, whose single caller
//! (`FUN_1403f74a0` <- `FUN_140403320`) is character construction. Nothing recomputes it, which
//! makes it the same class of lever as `ChrExFollowCam+0x468`: write it once, put it back on
//! release.
//!
//! And it is free of side effects on anything that matters here, which is settled RE rather than
//! hope: body scale is RENDER-ONLY. `SetScaleSize` writes `ChrCtrl+0x2d4..0x2dc` and mirrors to
//! `CSChrDataModule+0x54..0x5c` and touches `CSChrPhysicsModule` nowhere, so the hknp capsule --
//! the body's collision, its hurtbox and its `hitHeight` -- does not move. See `bd`
//! `possession-camera-size-adaptation-levers-2026-09-01`, which reached the same conclusion from
//! the other direction and warned the camera layer off scaling for exactly this reason.
//!
//! # What the scale IS, and why this module contains no notion of "centre"
//!
//! [`scale_for`] is one division: `creature hitHeight / player hitHeight`. That is deliberate, and
//! it is the answer to "is `hitHeight` the right notion of the centre of the model" -- **the
//! question does not arise**, because this layer never decides where the centre is. The player's
//! model already carries its own lock-gaze dummy at whatever fraction of its height FromSoftware
//! put it; scaling by `s` multiplies that fraction's height by `s` and nothing else. The anchor
//! lands where the game's own artists would have put it on a body of that size.
//!
//! All `hitHeight` has to be, then, is PROPORTIONAL to model size -- and it is the only scalar in
//! the game that is. ELDEN RING ships no chr-scale param in any of its 179 paramdefs, and the
//! FLVER bounding box is build-time-only and degenerate (`FLT_MAX`) on eleven chrs including
//! `c0000`, so the two obvious alternatives do not exist. [`crate::camera::geometry`] reached the
//! same dead end and rests on the same field.
//!
//! **The honest limitation**: `hitHeight` is the PHYSICS capsule, and on a long-necked or
//! long-tailed creature the visual model is taller than its capsule. The ratio then understates
//! the size and the reticle sits lower than the *visual* centre -- lower, never at the feet. There
//! is no better source; this is the same ceiling the camera layer works under.

// Pure arithmetic; ungated so its tests run on the host with no game running.
