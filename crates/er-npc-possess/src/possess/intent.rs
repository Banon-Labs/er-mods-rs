//! WHERE THE POSSESSED CREATURE IS TOLD TO GO, and the four fields that takes.
//!
//! # The one field that decides whether anything happens
//!
//! This module used to emit two writes and the creature did not move. The reason was not the two
//! it emitted; it was the two it did not. `[vt+0x50]` (`FUN_1403d0250`) -- the slot we forward,
//! because it is the one that moves the body -- computes the frame's move vector inside
//!
//! ```text
//! if (aiIns->walkType != 0 && ChrIns::GetMoveType(chr) != 0) { ... wantToMoveTo - riderPos ... }
//! ```
//!
//! and otherwise leaves it `DL_ZERO_VECTOR`. `walkType` is written by `CSAiFunc::MoveTo`, by
//! `ClearMoveRequest`, and by the AI goal bodies -- all of them downstream of the goal selection
//! this crate no-ops at `[vt+0x48]`. So a possessed creature's `walkType` is frozen at whatever
//! the last goal left, which for a fresh spawn is `0`: a perfect `wantToMoveTo`, written every
//! frame, consumed by a branch that never runs.
//!
//! `GetMoveType` is the other half of that gate and is NOT ours to set -- it comes from the
//! creature's own `NpcParam` row, so a creature the game ships as stationary stays stationary and
//! that is correct. See [`crate::possess::layout::ai_ins`] for the byte proof of all of it.
//!
//! # WHICH WAY IS FORWARD: the sign, and its two proofs
//!
//! `forward = (-sin yaw, 0, -cos yaw)`. The minus signs are not a convention someone picked; they
//! are read out of the binary twice, by routes that share nothing.
//!
//! **Route one -- the loop this module's writes actually feed.** `FUN_1402c9410`, the
//! `turnTarget` dispatch `AiIns::UpdateMovement` ends with, takes the direction to face
//! `d = wantToMoveTo - GetPhysicsPosition()` and stores an `AngleBundle` whose yaw is
//!
//! ```text
//! atan2f(d.x, d.z) + PI          ; 1.16.2 0x1402ca1c4, ADDSS XMM0,[0x1430b2614] = 3.14159274
//! ```
//!
//! into `aiIns+0xc3f0` (`FUN_1402c6850` writes `param_1[0x187e]`, i.e. byte `0xc3f0`). `[vt+0x50]`
//! then forms the frame's turn delta as `aiIns[0xc3f0] - ChrIns::GetOrientation()`. A body that
//! already faces `d` must produce a zero delta, so `GetOrientation().y = atan2(d.x, d.z) + PI`,
//! and inverting that gives `d = (-sin yaw, 0, -cos yaw)`. The `+ PI` IS the minus sign.
//!
//! **Route two -- the engine's own "which way is this character facing".** `GetForward` is
//! `CS::ChrCtrl::GetPhysicsOrientation`, which builds the rotation matrix from
//! `qInterpolatedOrientation` and multiplies it by `DL_Z_VECTOR ^ FloatVector4_14329f470` -- the
//! `+Z` basis vector XOR'd with `(-0.0, -0.0, -0.0, -0.0)`, i.e. **negated**. So the character's
//! forward is minus the image of local `+Z`: the models face local `-Z`.
//!
//! # `right` WAS ALSO WRONG, and the note here used to say otherwise
//!
//! An earlier version of this section concluded that `right` did not need changing, deriving
//! `forward x up = (cos yaw, 0, -sin yaw)` and calling that the image of local `+X`. The
//! arithmetic is right and the conclusion is wrong, which is the worst shape a note can have: it
//! reads as proof. `forward x up` is the RIGHT-hand-rule construction, and Elden Ring is
//! left-handed (`+X` right, `+Y` up, `+Z` forward), so in this basis that cross product yields
//! LEFT. A model whose nose is local `-Z` -- which the forward proof above establishes -- has its
//! right hand at local `-X`, not `+X`.
//!
//! So `right = (-cos yaw, 0, sin yaw)`, the negation of what shipped between 2026-09-02 and the
//! fix below.
//!
//! **The evidence for this one is the OBSERVABLE, and that is stated rather than dressed up.**
//! There is no `GetRight`/`GetSide` export to pair with `GetForward` -- searched, none exists --
//! and the one binary route that looked promising is ambiguous: `CalcSelfToDirectionPos` sets
//! `AI_DIR_TYPE_L` to `-row1`, which WOULD settle it, except that the same switch sets
//! `AI_DIR_TYPE_F` to `+row3` while `GetPhysicsOrientation` proves the body's forward is `-row3`.
//! Those two cannot both be the body's own frame, so the `DIR_TYPE` frame is rotated by something
//! this note cannot pin, and reading `L` out of it would be a guess wearing a citation.
//!
//! What is not ambiguous: pressing A (`stick.x = -1`) rotated every creature CLOCKWISE viewed
//! from above -- toward its own right -- consistently and across creature types. A left input that
//! turns the body right is a sign error on the lateral vector and nothing else. The handedness
//! argument above agrees with that measurement, which is why it is kept; the measurement is what
//! decides it.
//!
//! # The race this module still has to lose safely
//!
//! `[vt+0x50]` runs `AiIns::UpdateMovement` before reading any of this, and that function branches
//! three ways over `wantToMoveTo`:
//!
//! ```text
//! if HasFollowPathMoveTarget(pathData) && <a second path predicate> && !IsArrived()
//!         wantToMoveTo = own physics position          // "stop"
//! else if HasFollowPathMoveTarget(pathData) && !aiIns[0xe990] && !IsArrived()
//!         wantToMoveTo = pathData->target              // the path wins
//! else    wantToMoveTo unchanged                        // OUR value survives
//! ```
//!
//! A possessed creature has no follow-path target -- building one is `FUN_1402c65e0`, the third
//! thing `MoveTo` does and the one this crate does NOT reproduce -- so both predicates are false
//! and the third branch is the live one. [`IntentWrite`] still emits `pathData->target` as well as
//! `wantToMoveTo`, with the same value, because the two can never disagree when they are one
//! number written twice and it is the branch-two answer for free. Only branch one still escapes
//! us, and no field write reaches it.
//!
//! # `turnTarget` IS a steering wheel, in exactly one of its values
//!
//! An earlier version of this note said writing `turnTarget` steers nothing, because the named
//! points an `AiTargetPointType` selects stop being refreshed once goal selection is dead. That is
//! true of every value except `TARGET_SELF`, which is refreshed from a field we write ourselves.
//! `UpdateMovement` ends with `FUN_1402c9410(aiIns, aiIns->turnTarget)`, whose `TARGET_SELF`
//! branch takes `wantToMoveTo - GetPhysicsPosition()` as the direction to face and stores the
//! resulting angles where `[vt+0x50]` differences them against the body's live orientation.
//!
//! So `TARGET_SELF` means "face wherever you have been told to walk". The body still converges at
//! its own `NpcParam` turn rate -- that is the locomotion executor's business and we do not touch
//! it -- but it now converges on something the player chose.
//!
//! # Nothing here writes a velocity
//!
//! The move vector `[vt+0x50]` builds is a normalised DIRECTION, transformed by the body's model
//! matrix and handed to `CSChrActionRequestModule` -- the same request module the player's own pad
//! feeds. The behaviour graph turns that into locomotion clips and their root motion moves the
//! body. There is no velocity anywhere on the path, which is why `[movement]` no longer carries a
//! `root_motion_only` switch: it was never a choice.

// Pure math; stays ungated so its tests run on the host.
