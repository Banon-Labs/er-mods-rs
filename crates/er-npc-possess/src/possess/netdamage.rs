//! WHY A POSSESSED CREATURE CANNOT HURT ANOTHER PLAYER, AND WHY THEY CANNOT HURT IT BACK.
//!
//! The user's report was "I can't damage other players in a seamless invasion", then "they can't
//! damage me either -- neither HP bar goes down". Both halves have an answer in the binary, and
//! they are NOT the same answer. This module carries the first one as data, because it is a
//! decision the game makes from a table and a table can be transcribed and tested.
//!
//! # The routing matrix
//!
//! A chr-vs-chr hit that survives the team/immunity filter reaches the VICTIM's
//! `CSChrDamageModule` vtable slot 7. For an ordinary character that is `FUN_140445060` (1.16.2
//! `0x140445060`, 1.17 candidate `0x1404455c0`); the player's `CSPlayerDamageModule` overrides it
//! with `FUN_14044caf0` (1.17 `0x14044d050`), which applies the hit immediately when the victim is
//! the local main player and otherwise falls through to the same generic routine.
//!
//! That routine classifies BOTH characters with `FUN_14044a1b0` (1.17 candidate `0x14044a710`)
//! into one of seven categories -- see [`Category`] -- and looks the pair up in a 7x7 table of
//! `u32` modes:
//!
//! ```text
//! mode = table[victimCategory * 7 + attackerCategory]
//! table = DAT_142a36400   when AttackDamageInfo+0x11c == 0     (1.17: 0x142a39430)
//!         DAT_142a364d0   otherwise                            (1.17: 0x142a39500)
//! ```
//!
//! Both tables were located in `eldenring-deobf-1.17.bin` by an exact 196-byte content match with
//! a UNIQUE hit, so the installed build routes damage the same way 1.16.2 does. What each mode
//! does is a second, tiny table (`DAT_142a36598`) plus the `if/else` chain around it -- transcribed
//! into [`Route`].
//!
//! # The one cell that decides the feature
//!
//! ```text
//! victim = a REMOTE player (category 2), attacker = an NPC (category 3 or 4)  ->  mode 0
//! ```
//!
//! Mode 0 is [`Route::ComputeOnly`]: it calls `FUN_140445f00`, which resolves the guard behaviour,
//! looks up the `AtkParam` row and computes the damage numbers into the `AttackDamageInfo` -- and
//! then stops. `DAT_142a36598[0]` has its high byte set, so `HitChr` is NOT called, so no HP is
//! subtracted; `cVar14` stays zero, so neither `Packet15` nor the vitals packet is built. The one
//! remaining call is `victim->GetManipulator()->vtable[+0x70](info)`, and that slot is
//! `FUN_1403cd970` -- a bare `ret` -- in BOTH the `PadManipulator` vtable (`0x142a2b778`) and the
//! `NetworkManipulator` vtable (`0x142a2b1a8`). The hit is computed and dropped.
//!
//! **The only attacker category that can put damage on a remote player is category 1,
//! `CS::PlayerIns::IsMainPlayerIns` -- the local player's own `PlayerIns`.** That cell is mode 4,
//! [`Route::SendPvpDamage`], which calls `CSPlayerDamageModule` slot 21 (`0x14044ce40`, 1.17
//! candidate `0x14044d3a0`): build a `Packet15`, fetch the victim's `PlayerNetworkSession` and
//! `SendHitPacket`. Player-versus-player damage is resolved on the ATTACKER's client and shipped
//! to the victim; enemy-versus-player damage is resolved on the VICTIM's own client and never
//! sent at all (their row 1 column 3/4 is mode 1, apply locally).
//!
//! So a creature's attack has no path to another player's HP from the possessing player's machine,
//! by construction, for every creature. This is not creature-dependent, and it is not the bullet
//! path either: `FUN_14038b2f0`, the bullet-versus-chr resolver, ends in the same
//! `victim->damage->vtable[7](victimModule, bulletOwner, info)` call and therefore the same table,
//! with the bullet's owning `ChrIns` as the attacker.
//!
//! # Nor can it be forged
//!
//! Even a hit that reached mode 4 would not land. The `Packet15` receiver
//! (`WorldChrManImp` pump `FUN_14050e4a0`) resolves BOTH handles before it touches anything:
//!
//! ```text
//! victim  = GetChrInsByP2PEntityHandle(packet.victim);   if (victim  == null) skip
//! dealer  = GetChrInsByP2PEntityHandle(packet.attacker); if (dealer  == null) skip
//! HitChr(victim->damage, dealer, info, true); SetHP(hp - packet.damage); SetStamina(...)
//! ```
//!
//! A creature this crate spawned has no handle the other client can resolve, and that is not an
//! inference. `CS::ChrSet`'s dynamic spawn (`FUN_140492a90`, reached from the crate's
//! [`crate::spawn::game::SPAWN_DYNAMIC_CHR_RVA`]) builds the character's `P2PEntityHandle` as
//! `P2PEntityHandle(&handle, blockId = -1, chrSetIndex, index)` -- the invalid `0xFFFFFFFF`
//! blockId the damage forwarder itself tests for (`if (handle.blockId != 0xffffffff)`). The
//! creature is a local identity in a local ChrSet slot, so `GetChrInsByP2PEntityHandle` on the
//! other machine has nothing to return and the packet would be discarded on arrival.
//!
//! Making the hit belong to the player would mean the attack itself being player-owned -- the
//! game's own mechanism for that is a player-owned bullet, not a relabelled NPC swing.
//!
//! Possessing a creature the MAP placed does not change the verdict either. That character has a
//! real handle, but the swing does not: this crate fires attacks by writing
//! `CSChrEventModule+0x18 requestAnimationId`, a field the engine consumes locally and publishes
//! nowhere. The other client's copy of that enemy is animating whatever its own owner drives it
//! to, so the attack the possessing player is watching exists on one machine.
//!
//! # The incoming half is a DIFFERENT mechanism, and the obvious suspect is not it
//!
//! It is tempting to blame this crate's own body neuter: `NpcPossessionEngine::neuter` sets
//! `ChrIns.chrFlags1c5 |= 0x10`, and `ChrIns::IsImmuneToAttack` reads exactly that bit. But the
//! bit lives in the possessing player's process, and the receive path quoted above calls `SetHP`
//! **unconditionally** -- there is no `IsImmuneToAttack`, no `FUN_1404443e0`, no team check on an
//! arriving `Packet15`. So the invincibility bit does NOT make a possessing player unkillable by
//! another player; what it refuses is every hit resolved LOCALLY, which for a player victim means
//! NPCs, environment and falls. Saying otherwise gets the fix wrong.
//!
//! What the other player has to hit is the player's own body, which co-location keeps at the
//! creature's root and which their client sees as an ordinary Tarnished standing there.
//!
//! # The team byte is not the blocker either
//!
//! Possession writes `ChrIns+0x6c teamType = 15 (Charmed)` to fix lock-on, and there are two
//! independent 79x79 `CSTeamTypeRelation` matrices, not one:
//!
//! | table | consulted by | 1.16.2 | 1.17 |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | damage | `CanTeamTypeDamageEachOther` / `canTeamTypeHitAnother` | `0x143b180e0` | `0x143b1c0e0` |
//! | targeting | `CS::ChrIns::CanTargetTeamType` | `0x143b243f0` | `0x143b283f0` |
//!
//! In the DAMAGE table, Charmed is `CSTeamTypeRival` against every player team (1, 2 and 4) in
//! both directions, and `Rival::Validate` returns true for an attack that sets `opposeTarget` --
//! which every ordinary attack does. In the TARGETING table those same cells are
//! `CSTeamTypeFriend`. Identical on both builds; `scripts/ghidra/team-relation-report.py`
//! reproduces it. So the team write costs lock-on against players and costs no damage.

// Pure: a transcription of two game tables plus a state machine over observations. Ungated so
// `cargo test -p er-npc-possess` proves it on the host with no game running.
