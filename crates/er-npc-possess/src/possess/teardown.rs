//! THE ORDER RELEASE HAPPENS IN, as a state machine that cannot be run out of order or stopped
//! half way.
//!
//! # Why the order is not a comment in one function
//!
//! Release runs down three different paths -- the hotkey, the possessed creature dying, and
//! `DLL_PROCESS_DETACH` -- and each one is a place where somebody can write the steps in a
//! plausible order that is subtly the wrong one. Six of the nine steps have a consequence if
//! they move:
//!
//! * **The HUD is handed back FIRST.** The retarget post-pass reads the creature's
//!   `CSChrDataModule` every frame until it is told to stop, and every step below it either reads
//!   through that creature or is what makes it stop resolving.
//! * **The camera must be cleared AFTER the player has been moved.** Clearing first gives a
//!   visible frame of the old body standing wherever it was; moving first means the camera snaps
//!   to a player already standing in the right place.
//! * **The body is made mortal LAST of the body steps -- after it has been placed.** Invincibility
//!   is the only thing stopping `CSChrFallModule::Update` charging the body for the difference
//!   between its `lastGroundedPosition` and where it actually is (the gate is byte-read in
//!   [`crate::possess::fall`]), so clearing it before the placement hands back a mortal body at a
//!   position nothing has checked. Both abnormal releases in the reference log did exactly that
//!   and then failed the move.
//! * **The camera's SIZE must go back before the camera does.** While `WorldChrManDbg+0xb8` still
//!   names the creature, `ChrExFollowCam+0x468` still names the patched `LockCamParam` row -- so
//!   undoing them in this order shows at most one frame of the creature framed for a player, and
//!   the other order shows one frame of the player framed for a dragon.
//! * **`ChrCtrl+0x3b0` must be cleared BEFORE anything can tear the character down.**
//!   `ChrCtrl::Unref` compares that slot against zero and **DLPanics** when it is non-null. This
//!   is the step that must run even when every step before it failed.
//! * **A spawned creature is removed AFTER that clear**, for exactly the same reason from the other
//!   side: `WorldChrManImp::RemoveChrIns` hands the character to `CSDelayDeleteMan`, and the
//!   destruction that eventually follows is the thing that runs `ChrCtrl::Unref`. Despawning first
//!   arms the crash the step before it exists to prevent -- on a delay, in a destructor.
//! * **Save suppression is lifted LAST**, because `PlayerIns::UpdateSafePosition` and
//!   `UpdateBlockPosition` write the save's respawn fields the instant that gate opens, and they
//!   must not do it from a position the player is about to leave.
//!
//! # The property that matters more than the order
//!
//! **A failing step does not stop the run.** A release that gives up half way leaves a live
//! `ChrCtrl+0x3b0`, and the next time that character is unloaded the game DLPanics -- so the
//! failure mode of "be careful" is a crash minutes later in an unrelated place. [`Teardown`]
//! therefore records what failed and keeps going, and the tests below pin that.

// Pure state handling; stays ungated so its tests run on the host.
