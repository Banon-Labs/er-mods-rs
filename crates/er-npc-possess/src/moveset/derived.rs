//!
//! A moveset layer that quietly drops half of a boss's attacks is indistinguishable, from the
//! player's chair, from one that is broken. Both look like "I press the button and nothing
//! interesting happens". So every animation the generator LOOKED at appears here: the ones on
//! offer with their bucket, rank and reach, and the ones withheld with the reason they were
//! withheld. If a favourite attack is missing, this file says whether it was denied, and for what.
//!
//! # It is output, not input
//!
//! Nothing reads it back. Corrections go in `er-npc-possess.toml` under `[chr.cNNNN]`, where
//! `unusable = [...]`, `usable = [...]` and `pin = { r2 = 3046 }` are already parsed. That split
//! is deliberate: this file is rewritten on every possession, so an edit here would be lost the
//! next time the hotkey was pressed, and a config file that silently discards your edits is worse
//! than no config file. The header says so in the file itself, where somebody about to type into
//! it will actually see it.

// Pure text generation; ungated so `cargo test` proves it on the host.
