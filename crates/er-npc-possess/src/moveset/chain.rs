//! Cancel discipline: when a press may leave the animation that is already playing.
//!
//! # The engine has none, and that is a measured fact rather than a suspicion
//!
//! Firing an attack is a write to `CSChrEventModule+0x18 requestAnimationId`, and **nothing on
//! that path consults what the creature is currently doing**. `CS::CSChrEventModule::Update`
//! (1.16.2 `0x14043a580`) gates the request on exactly five things, none of which is the current
//! animation:
//!
//! * `!CS::ChrIns::IsDead`;
//! * `componentContainer->actionFlag->actionAnimationFlags` bit 12 clear -- and that bit has three
//!   `or dword [rax+0x10], 0x1000` sites in the whole image, two of them inside `SetTextScale` /
//!   `SetFontSize` (debug text, a different structure at the same offset) and the third inside
//!   `HksAct` (`0x14040cbd0`), the Lua action-script host. It is script-driven state, not a
//!   per-swing marker;
//! * `!CS::CSChrThrowModule::IsInTrow`;
//! * `FUN_14043acc0`, which is not a cancel check at all -- its whole body compares the requested
//!   id against `PlayerCommonParam::animeID_MaterialItemPick`, `animeID_DropItemPick`,
//!   `animeID_SleepCollectorItemPick` and two `GameSystemCommonParam` treasure pickup ids, and
//!   defers those five to `actionFlag->field_0x28` instead of playing them;
//! * `field_0x70 == 0`.
//!
//! Everything else goes straight to `FUN_140c14400`, which formats `W_Event%04d` and hands it to
//! the behaviour graph -- which accepts it, mid-swing, every time. So the cancel the player sees
//! is not a bug in how this crate writes the field. It is the absence of any rule at all, and the
//! rule has to live here.
//!
//! # ...but it does know, one module along
//!
//! What the request path does not consult, the animation system writes down. TAE event type 0
//! (`ChrActionFlag`) with `FlagType` 86 sets bit 5 of
//! `CSChrActionRequestModule::taeCancels`, `CS::ChrIns::PreBehaviorSafe` clears that bit every
//! frame, and `CS::CSAiFunc::IsEnableCancelAttack` reads it to decide whether a creature's own AI
//! may chain out of the swing it is in. So the game already computes, per creature, per frame,
//! per animation, the exact predicate this layer needs -- for CREATURES, which is what a
//! possession is wearing. Reading that bit is [`Availability::Chainable`], and the answer is the
//! engine's rather than ours.
//!
//! It costs no game address: [`crate::possess::game::Chr::attack_cancel_allowed`] reads the field
//! and applies the same two tests the engine's own leaf predicate applies. See
//! [`crate::possess::layout::chr_action_request_module`] for the byte proof on both builds.
//!
//! # The offline window, which is the fallback and the report
//!
//! The same TimeAct event has a start and an end in animation-local seconds, and those are
//! readable offline from the corpus -- so the shipped table carries the START as
//! [`crate::moveset::table::Move::chain_from_cs`], and this layer compares it against
//! `CSChrTimeActModule::animQueue[readIdx].localTime`, the creature's own playhead. That is the
//! answer used when the module chain does not read, and it is also what lets
//! `er-npc-possess.derived.toml` say per move whether the game authored a real window for it or
//! whether the mod is going to make the player wait out the animation.
//!
//! A move with no window from either source is [`Availability::Committed`] for its whole length,
//! so a press during it waits for the animation to end rather than guessing. That is the
//! least-bad rule and it is never an interrupt.
//!
//! # What "its whole length" has to mean, and what it meant on 2026-09-02
//!
//! It has to mean the clip's length. It used to mean forever, and that is the bug the first live
//! run found: a possessed c4604 spent five and a half minutes standing still while every press
//! was held as "mid-attack" and dropped. Two things were wrong and both are fixed here.
//!
//! The first is that the creature was not animating at all and this layer could not tell.
//! `CSChrTimeActModule::animQueue[readIdx]` is only meaningful when `readIdx != writeIdx` --
//! `PreBehaviorSafe` sets them equal every frame and each animation actually driven pushes one
//! entry -- so an equal pair means nothing was driven and the entry is a leftover. Reading it
//! anyway reported the attack from minutes ago, forever. `Chr::current_anim_frame` now answers
//! `None` there, and `None` is [`Availability::Idle`]: a creature animating nothing has no swing
//! to protect, so the press fires.
//!
//! The second is that every `Committed` answer below rests on evidence with no expiry of its own
//! -- an engine bit that may never read, a window that was never measured -- so "unknown" could
//! outlive the animation it was describing. The clip's own `animLength` is now checked FIRST, and
//! nothing may hold a press past it. The worst case is one clip, not one session.
//!
//! Both are the same mistake in different clothes: a fail-closed default on an oracle that cannot
//! read is indistinguishable, from the player's chair, from the mod not working. Which is why
//! [`Source`] exists and every branch says on whose authority it answered.
//!
//! The fallback is slightly more permissive than the engine, and only in one direction. The
//! table carries the window's START and not its END, so once the offline window has opened this
//! layer treats the rest of the clip as chainable, while the live bit goes false again when the
//! event's end time passes. Measured on c4500, most windows run to within a frame or two of the
//! clip's end, so the difference is a short tail at the very end of a recovery -- and it only
//! applies at all when the module pointer failed to read, which is the path where the choice is
//! between this and nothing. Carrying the end as a second column is the fix if it ever matters.
//!
//! # How much of the moveset this actually covers, and what the rest falls back to
//!
//! 5,086 of the 6,921 shipped moves carry a window. Split by what they are, that is **4,576 of
//! the 4,669 ATTACKS (98.0%)** against 510 of the 2,252 movement moves -- and the split is the
//! shape of the data rather than a hole in it, because FlagType 86 is the flag for cancelling an
//! ATTACK and a dodge is not one. So a press during an attack chains on the game's own window
//! almost always, and a press during a dodge usually waits the dodge out, which for a
//! half-second clip is what waiting means anyway.
//!
//! # What is read one frame late
//!
//! The possession ticks in `CSTaskGroupIndex::FrameBegin`. `CS::ChrIns::PreBehaviorSafe` clears
//! the transient `taeCancels` bits and the TimeAct events re-set them during the behaviour
//! update, both later in the same frame -- so every value this layer reads describes the window
//! the PREVIOUS frame established. 16 ms against a window whose median width is 800 ms, and
//! acting on the window the last frame established is the correct reading of a press anyway.

// Pure state machine over observations; ungated so `cargo test` proves it on the host.
