//! WHAT THE FOUR BUTTONS DO RIGHT NOW, on screen, while you are wearing something.
//!
//! # The defect this exists to close
//!
//! The page keys worked from the day they landed and nobody could tell. A live session on
//! 2026-09-02 logged
//!
//! ```text
//! moveset: right attack set 2/17 -- r1 3008, r2 3002
//! moveset: left attack set 2/2 -- l1 3110, l2 nothing
//! ```
//!
//! while the player, watching the screen, reported "I still don't see any abilities to switch
//! between". Both statements are true: the feature fired, and its entire output went to a text
//! file beside the game executable and to `er-npc-possess.derived.toml`, neither of which is
//! visible from inside a full-screen game.
//!
//! That is worse than a missing feature, because the page is a MODE. Being on set 7 of 17 with
//! nothing on screen saying so makes every button press a guess, and the only way back to a known
//! state is to release and re-possess. A mode with no indicator is a mode you cannot use.
//!
//! # What is in here and what is not
//!
//! This module is the STATE and the TEXT, and both are pure: [`Banner::from_dispatcher`] reads a
//! [`Dispatcher`] and produces the lines, and the host tests assert them without a game. The
//! drawing is [`crate::overlay`], which is windows-only and paints these same strings onto the
//! process's one imgui context.
//!
//! # The published snapshot, and why it is not rebuilt per frame
//!
//! The render thread runs on `Present` -- 60 to 144 times a second -- and the game thread owns the
//! [`Dispatcher`] inside the possession engine's lock. Reaching across that lock from the renderer
//! would put the game's frame behind the overlay's; instead the game thread PUBLISHES a [`Banner`]
//! whenever the content changes, which is exactly three moments:
//!
//! * a possession starts,
//! * a page key turns a page,
//! * the possession ends (cleared).
//!
//! [`Banner`] is `Copy` and heap-free precisely so that the per-frame read is a lock, a struct
//! copy and an unlock. [`showing`] is an atomic ahead of it, so a session that never possesses
//! anything never touches the mutex at all.

// Pure state and formatting over the dispatcher; no game memory. Ungated so `cargo test` proves
// the text on the host, where none of the game bindings exist.
