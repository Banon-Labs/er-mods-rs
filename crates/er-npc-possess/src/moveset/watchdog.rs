//! The thing that stops a bad animation from ending the session.
//!
//! # Why this exists at all
//!
//! The offline classifier gates on everything it can see: a transition consumes the event, the
//! target state has a clip, the TimeAct opens a damage window, the behaviour row resolves. What it
//! cannot see is whether the animation TERMINATES for a creature nobody is steering. Some states
//! only exit on a condition the AI would have satisfied -- and the AI is exactly what possession
//! turned off, because `[vt+0x48] UpdateAi` is no-oped. A state like that leaves the player stuck
//! in a pose with no way out, which ends the session rather than merely disappointing them.
//!
//! So the classifier is allowed to be wrong, and this catches it: non-neutral, the playhead not
//! advancing, no input consumed, for long enough that nothing else explains it. The animation is then forced
//! back to idle and written into `er-npc-possess.derived.toml` as `unusable`, so the SAME move
//! cannot cost the player a second session. The classifier heals from its own failures rather than
//! needing a corpus change.
//!
//! # Why all three conditions, and not just the timer
//!
//! Each one alone has a legitimate long case. A slow wind-up is non-neutral for seconds. A clip
//! can be paused by the engine for a frame. A player who put the pad down is consuming no input.
//! Only the conjunction -- non-neutral, the playhead frozen, and nobody asking for anything -- has
//! no innocent reading.
//!
//! # It asks whether the ANIMATION advanced, not whether the BODY moved
//!
//! It used to ask the second, and that was wrong in a way that got worse the longer a possession
//! lasted. A stance, a charge and a wind-up all animate correctly while translating nothing; more
//! damagingly, while locomotion is broken EVERY attack translates nothing, so the watchdog would
//! deny one animation every four seconds until the creature's moveset was empty. Denials are
//! permanent for the session, so that is unrecoverable without releasing. The playhead --
//! `animQueue[readIdx].localTime` -- answers the question actually being asked.

// Pure state machine over observations; ungated so `cargo test` proves it on the host.
