//! The shipped moveset table: what each creature can be made to do, decided offline.
//!
//! # Why a table at all, rather than reading the graph at runtime
//!
//! Whether an animation can be fired is a property of the creature's Havok behaviour graph, and
//! the answer is not observable from inside the game. `CSChrEventModule::requestAnimationId`
//! formats the name `W_Event%04d`, hands it to the behaviour world, and if no
//! `hkbStateMachine::TransitionInfo` consumes that event id the call **returns cleanly and does
//! nothing at all** -- no error, no exception, no visible failure. A runtime "try it and see"
//! therefore cannot tell a wrong animation from a working one.
//!
//! So the gate happens offline, where the graph can be read: `scripts/er-moveset-table-gen.py`
//! walks every unpacked `<chr>.behbnd.dcx`, keeps only the ids some transition really consumes and
//! whose target state really has a clip, and writes the result here. Declared is not fireable --
//! the median creature declares 1366 event names and can fire 580 of them -- and that gap is
//! precisely what this file exists to have already resolved.
//!
//! ...and that is only half of it. The field write formats `W_Event%04d`, but `W_Event` is a broad
//! alias layer rather than a total one, so an id can be perfectly fireable under a DIFFERENT name
//! and unreachable by that field -- every dodge in the game is exactly that. The generator
//! therefore also resolves WHICH spelling reaches each id on each creature, from that creature's
//! own event table; see [`Prefix`].
//!
//! # What is in the file
//!
//! Integers. Chr id, animation ids, a bucket, a rank, a reach band, a prefix index, a denial
//! reason. No game
//! bytes, no asset payloads, no strings taken out of the game -- animation ids are BND entry
//! filenames, and everything else is a decision the generator made about one. That is what keeps
//! it inside the repo's no-game-derived-binaries rule; see the generator's own header.
//!
//! # The one animation that lies about its own name
//!
//! `W_Event3110` plays clip `a000_003000`, not 3110 -- confirmed on every one of the eleven bosses
//! checked. So a row carries BOTH ids: [`Move::fire`] is what gets written into the request field,
//! [`Move::played`] is what actually appears on screen. They are equal everywhere else, which is
//! why the format spells the second one only when it differs.
//!
//! # The grab, and the animation everybody mistakes for it
//!
//! A grab is not a 4000-band animation and it is not TimeAct event 304. It is an ORDINARY,
//! already-fireable attack whose `AtkParam_Npc` row has `throwTypeId != 0`: when that hit lands,
//! `ApplyDamage` hands it to the throw system before calculating any damage, and the throw system
//! -- not the event layer -- drives both parties into the 4000-band clips. That is exactly why no
//! event name in the 4000 band has a transition behind it on any of the 409 creatures swept: those
//! clips are reached by the bare names `W_ThrowAtk`/`W_ThrowDef` and are never addressed by id.
//! See [`Throw`] for the join and [`Denial::ThrowResultClip`] for how the clips are reported.

// Pure parsing; no game memory is touched here, so it stays ungated and `cargo test` proves it on
// the host.
