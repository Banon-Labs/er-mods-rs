//! The schema: every table in `er-npc-possess.toml` that is not a hotkey.
//!
//! Layer 1 shipped this whole schema before anything read it, on the reasoning that the file a
//! player tunes now has to be the file the later layers read -- a schema that appears a table at a
//! time makes every early config a migration. Layers 2, 3 and 4 have since consumed most of it;
//! what remains unread is named in the shipped file's own comments rather than here, so the two
//! cannot disagree.
//!
//! # The rule every field here follows
//!
//! A value that does not parse KEEPS THE ONE ALREADY IN FORCE and says so. Not the built-in
//! default -- that silently drags someone back off a setting they had deliberately moved -- and
//! not zero. It is the same rule `er_hotkey_config::Binding` enforces for keys, applied to the
//! scalars, because a typo in `speed_scale` is exactly as invisible as a typo in `hotkey`.
//!
//! # The one table that is not live
//!
//! [`TargetSettings`] is the whole of `[target]`, and it is deliberately a struct of its own
//! rather than four fields on the config: changing who you are about to possess must not take
//! effect while you are possessing somebody. See `config::PossessConfig::stage_target`.

/// through six more `Binding` fields plus six more `ConfigUpdate` variants would have doubled the
/// config's moving parts for a strictly smaller failure.
///
/// # Why every pad binding ships EMPTY
///
/// This crate claims no game prologue -- specifically not the DirectInput `GetDeviceState` one
/// that three other shells in this profile already share -- so it can SEE a press but cannot
/// take it away from the game. See the `er-npc-possess` entry in
/// `scripts/me3-dll-conflicts.toml`. A controller has few buttons and Elden Ring uses them, so a
/// shipped pad default for "move the picker cursor down" would very likely also swap the
/// player's spell every time it was pressed -- and a default that misbehaves out of the box is
/// worse than no default.
///
/// THAT IS NOT A MEASUREMENT. Elden Ring's own binding table was not read; it is a judgement
/// about where a collision is likely, and every one of these keys is rebindable while the game
/// runs precisely because the judgement may be wrong for a given setup.
///
/// # Why the keyboard defaults are the ARROWS and not the keypad
///
/// The keypad was the first choice, for being the cluster least likely to be in the way. It was
/// wrong for a reason that has nothing to do with collisions: `KP_8` parses to `VK_NUMPAD8`, and
/// with NUMLOCK OFF the numpad's 8 key does not produce `VK_NUMPAD8` at all -- it produces
/// `VK_UP`. [`crate::input::chord_held`] reads the virtual key, so all four navigation defaults
/// would have been silently dead for anyone with NumLock off or no numpad at all, on a feature
/// with no runtime proof. A key that does nothing and says nothing is a worse default than a key
/// that collides, because a collision is visible and this is not.
///
/// `Up`/`Down`/`Left`/`Right` produce `VK_UP`/`VK_DOWN`/`VK_LEFT`/`VK_RIGHT` from the arrow
/// cluster AND from the numpad with NumLock off, so both work. `KP_*` spellings still parse and
