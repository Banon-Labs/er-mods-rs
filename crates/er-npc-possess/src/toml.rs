//! A hand-rolled reader for the subset of TOML this DLL's config file uses.
//!
//! Hand-parsed rather than pulled through a TOML crate, for the same reason
//! `er-enemynpc-effects` and `er-refill-all` are: a settings file read once a second in a DLL
//! cross-compiled into the game process does not justify a dependency. Those two get away with a
//! four-line `find the key, split on '='` helper because their whole schema is flat. This one is
//! not -- it has named tables, and an OPEN-ENDED family of them (`[chr.c4500]`, one per character
//! id the player wants to override), so "which section is this key in" is a question the parser
//! has to answer rather than ignore.
//!
//! # What it accepts, and why each piece is here
//!
//! * `key = value` at the top level, and inside `[section]` / `[section.sub]` headers.
//! * **Unknown sections and unknown keys are carried, never rejected.** `[chr.cXXXX]` is
//!   open-ended by design and a later layer adds more tables; a parser that refused what it did
//!   not recognise would turn every forward-looking edit into a file the DLL says is broken.
//! * Arrays of scalars -- `bands_m = [4.0, 12.0]`, `unusable = [3300, 3301]`.
//! * One level of inline table -- `pin = { r2 = 3046 }`.
//! * Several assignments on one line separated by `;`. Real TOML does not allow this and the
//!   shipped default file does not use it, but the schema this crate was handed was written that
//!   way, so a file a player copies from a plan or a wiki page parses instead of silently losing
//!   every assignment after the first.
//! * `#` comments, to end of line, outside quotes.
//!
//! # What it does NOT do
//!
//! No multi-line values, no `"""` strings, no `[[array of tables]]` semantics (a `[[x]]` header
//! is read as the section `x`, which is enough not to lose the keys under it), no escape
//! sequences inside strings, and no type system -- every value comes back as text and the caller
//! decides what it is. Anything this cannot represent belongs in a second file rather than a
//! second parser.

// Windows-only crate in practice; this module is pure text handling and stays ungated so its
// tests run on the host.
