//!
//! Four surfaces answer one question. The in-game rows (`SAVE_PICKER_*`) stage a
//! container into the native list; the OS file dialog (`SAVE_PICKER_OS_*`) counts dialogs
//! and is shared by all three intents; the missing-save boot pick
//! (`SAVE_PICKER_OS_BOOT_*`) counts the boot intent's own outcomes, where a cancel quits
//! the game rather than backing out of a menu; and the dim overlay (`SAVE_PICKER_DIM_*`)
//! is the borderless window the dialog is owned to, so its stacking over the game is a
//! measurement rather than a race.
//!
//! Split out of `counters.rs` as a pure code move: nothing is renamed and no initial value
//! changes. Every name here is re-exported from `er_telemetry_core::counters` with a glob, so
