// A save the user picks after boot has no `CS::ProfileSummary` record: the boot save-data job that
// would have read one already ran and passed through. Without a record the native Continue row has
// nothing to load, which is why every picked save used to be routed into a title-time deserialize
// -- `0x14067b290`, a function whose only caller in the whole image is `CS::MoveMapStep::DoSaveStuff`
// (in-world). These counters make both halves of that visible.

// on `100-Lilbro/ER0000.co2`, run br-20260903-204517-82d2). This DLL writes the body-derived
