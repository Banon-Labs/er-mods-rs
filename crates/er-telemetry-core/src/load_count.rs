//! Load-count witnesses and the cross-check that makes them contradict each other OUT LOUD.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. A captured 3-load session (boot Continue + two System->Quit->Load-Profile
//! reloads of the SAME save slot) produced these numbers in one telemetry file:
//!
//! ```text
//! system_quit_profile_load_activate_count  4   2 picker browse/pick steps + 2 slot arms
//! system_quit_continue_confirm_allow_count 3   forwarded confirms == THE TOTAL, boot included
//! oracle_current_load_epoch                2   switch-machine commits only; boot never counted
//! oracle_save_picker_pick_count            2   picker file-picks; the boot load has none
//! oracle_save_picker_resubmit_count        2   window resubmits after a pick
//! oracle_switch_reload_committed           1   a BOOLEAN LATCH, reset per switch -- not a count
//! ```
//!
//! Six fields, four values, all reachable when asking "how many loads". Every one was CORRECT for
//! its own event class -- and precisely because each was individually correct, nothing in the run
//! noticed that recovering the number 3 required already knowing all six definitions. Two
//! independent hand-derivations from that file landed on 2 and on ">=3". Neither is the answer.
//!
//! No counter was under-reporting. There is no same-slot dedupe anywhere in the load path: nothing
//! keys on the loaded identity, and the captured run proves it -- the same save file was picked
//! twice, at `+39864ms` and `+66532ms`, with identical `len=28967888 hash=0x394158714daf526b`, and
//! BOTH picks counted. The 2s are narrower event classes than the 3s, not lost loads.
//!
//! `oracle_switch_reload_committed` deserves its own warning: it is a one-shot `compare_exchange(0,
//! 1)` latch cleared at the start of every switch, so it can never exceed 1 and can never agree with
//! any count. Reading it as "1 reload" is not an off-by-N, it is a category error.
//!
//! The defect was never a miscount. The file published six narrow event counts, no total, and no
//! statement of how the narrow counts compose into the total -- so the composition had to be
//! reconstructed by hand, and a hand reconstruction is exactly what nobody audits.
//!
//! THE DECOMPOSITION. Every world load in a session is one forwarded `continue_confirm` call.
//! That hook classifies each forward into exactly one of three buckets:
//!
//!   * `switch_reload_commits` -- a System->Quit->Load-Profile reload committed a fresh deserialize
//!     (the switch machine was mid-flight). This is the ONLY bucket the load epoch counts.
//!   * `non_switch_forwards`   -- a Continue outside the switch machine: the boot/title load.
//!   * `world_up_forwards`     -- a confirm that arrived while the previous world was still up (a
//!     state we never drive; previously logged and counted by NOTHING).
//!
//! so `forwards == switch_commits + non_switch + world_up`, exactly, by construction. That identity
//! is the load-count audit: violate it and a load landed in no bucket or was counted twice.
//!
//! THE EPOCH IS AN INDEX, NOT A COUNT. `oracle_current_load_epoch` is
//! `SYSTEM_QUIT_CONTINUE_CONFIRM_FRESH_DESER_COUNT`, incremented ONLY inside the switch machine.
//! The boot load does not increment it. So in a session whose loads are (boot, reload, reload) it
//! reads 2 -- which is simultaneously "2 switch reloads committed" and "the current load is index 2,
//! zero-based". `total = epoch + 1` therefore holds ONLY while a session performs exactly one
//! non-switch load, and silently lies otherwise (a telemetry-only run with no character load, or any
//! second non-switch Continue). Read [`LoadCountWitnesses::total_world_loads`] instead; it needs no
//! such assumption.
//!
//! WHAT THE EPOCH STILL CANNOT TELL YOU: whether those loads SUCCEEDED. Two captured runs both read
//! `oracle_current_load_epoch = 2`; one reached world residency three times, the other reached it
//! ONCE and softlocked. The epoch counts commits, not outcomes, so equal epochs across runs mean
//! "both reached a third load attempt" and nothing whatsoever about whether the worlds came up. Any
//! cross-run claim resting on epoch equality alone is void.

/// One failed load-count invariant. Bit flags rather than a message so the set survives as a single
/// integer in telemetry and can be asserted on exactly in tests.
