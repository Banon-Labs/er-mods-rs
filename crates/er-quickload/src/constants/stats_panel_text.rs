// adds a dedicated `ErStats` DefineEditText to the row template; the DLL hooks the native row-populate
// template `FUN_1408758d0` (the only writer of PlayerName/Level/Location/PlayTime) and, BEFORE calling

// never blank them (static RE of the 1.16.2 dump, which is the live image -- shift 0; row template
// = sprite 76 of `05_010_profileselect.gfx`, names read off the movie the DLL actually serves):
//   * `StaticText_110502` -- the "Level" CAPTION, an ENGINE-populated static field. The named-child
//     binder hands every child's name to the FMG static-text pass `FUN_14074c540`, which matches the
//     `StaticText_` prefix from the table at `PTR_s_StaticText__142a94aa0`, `atoi`s the trailing id
//     (110502) and calls the SetText CORE `FUN_140d842a0` DIRECTLY. The row-populate never writes
//     it, so it is written once per bind and survives row-clip reuse.
//   * `Level` -- the level VALUE. `FUN_140749ed0(&proxy->comp, *(u32*)(rowModel + 0x88))`, which
//     `DLTX::DLString::FormatW(L"%d")`s the int and SetTexts the digits. No int formats to nothing,
//     so a zeroed (or NULL, `FUN_140875790`) record still renders "0".
//   * `PlayTime` -- `FUN_14074a000(&proxy->comp, playtime)`, the string being the row model's own
//     `CS::MenuSaveDataSummary` playtime (+0xc8 literal, else the DLString at +0xd0), formatted from
//     seconds by `FUN_140875be0` inside the row-model builder `FUN_1408759e0`.
// LEVER, LEVEL FIELDS: neither can be emptied through the record, and a post-populate re-resolve is
// impossible (the named-child ctor 0x14074a7c0 resolves out of the PARENT proxy's embedded value at
// +0x28, which the populate destroys at its end). So a browse row HIDES them, per row, through the
// game's own visibility wrapper (`TITLE_PRESS_START_SET_VISIBLE_RVA`) -- content-free in both
// directions, which is what makes the restore as exact as the hide.
// LEVER, LOCATION/PLAYTIME: both strings come from the row model. A browse save-FILE row stages its
// timestamp into `Location` (top-right, same line as PlayerName) and hides the bottom `PlayTime`, so
// `ER0000.sl2` and `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` occupy one row instead of two vertical bands.
