// With the splash/logo/title visuals suppressed, every frame the game presents between its first
// `Present` (~+3.5s after attach) and the post-Continue loading window (~+15.5s) is pure black. The
// Present-hook VMT swap is already installed BEFORE the first present (task tick ~+3.0s), so the
// black gap is a draw-gating matter, not a hook-timing one: this module opens the gate at Present
// hit #1 with content that needs NOTHING from the game -- a hairline loading bar in the game's own
// understated presentation plus a small milestone label (5x7 embedded font, procedurally
// rasterized, no game-derived assets), progress driven purely by our own already-latched RAM
// semaphores:
//
//   BOOT     -- drawing at all (present hook + swapchain live)
//   GAME     -- `game_man_ptr_or_null() != 0` (GameMan constructed)
//   OFFLINE  -- `FORCE_OFFLINE_BYTES_CLEARED` (GameMan online bytes cleared, ~+8.5s)
//   TITLE    -- `TITLE_FADEIN_SKIP_FIRED` (zero-input FadeIn->Loop transition)
//   MENU     -- `PRODUCT_CORE_LAST_MENU_OPENED_LATCH` (title menu natural-open latch)
//   CONTINUE -- `SYSTEM_QUIT_CONTINUE_CONFIRM_ALLOW_COUNT` / `TFC_CONTINUE_FIRED`
//               (the visible SAVE LOAD tick marks the save-data pause immediately after this)
//   LOADING  -- forced Continue/native CS::LoadingScreen update -> HANDOFF. Early profile/keyed
//               semaphores only keep the cover drawing; they do not start the bail clock.
//
// Reached milestones are latched into a monotonic bitmask (a latch that later reads 0 cannot walk
// the bar backwards), and the displayed value creeps part-way toward the next milestone over time so
// the bar visibly moves between semaphores. The draw is a single submit on our OWN queue (transition
// PRESENT->COPY_DEST, CopyTextureRegion upload->backbuffer strip rect, transition back, CPU fence
// wait) -- no backbuffer readback: the pre-Continue frames are the content-free black this view

/// The proximate cause was a game-image detour that failed to install -- but the reason a single
/// failed detour was CATASTROPHIC rather than cosmetic is structural: on the boot epoch this
/// window had no backstop of any kind, because both of its exits are downstream of that same
/// detour.
///
///   * The release fade needs `world_handoff`, i.e. [`boot_view_cover_release_ready`], whose
///     `NATIVE_DONE_SEEN` half is written ONLY from `LOADING_SCREEN_CLOSE_SENT_HITS` or
///     `LOADING_SCREEN_BAR_PROGRESS_PERMILLE`, both fed by the CS::LoadingScreen detour. Measured
///     in the reported run: `release_native_done_seen = 0`, `fade_hits = 0`, `fade_start_ms = 0`.
///   * The FPS bail lives inside `if own_menu_active`, and the boot epoch is not an own-menu one
///     (`oracle_boot_view_epoch_kind = 0`), so that whole block is skipped.
///   * `can_move_handoff` is not a third exit: it needs `CAN_MOVE_CONFIRMED`, which only the
///     proof-only can-move probe writes, and its own comment says it never fires in a normal
///     session.
///
/// So: `stop_ms = 0`, `stop_reason = 0`, `semantic_releases = 0`, and
/// `present_full_clear_hits = 5001` against `present_hook_hits = 4794` -- full-clearing essentially
/// every Present, indefinitely.
///
/// WHY THESE SIGNALS AND NOT THE OBVIOUS ONES. A backstop keyed on anything a detour writes would
/// share the failure mode it exists to survive, which is the whole defect repeated one layer up.
/// Everything below is a pointer walk into game memory:
///
///   * `GameDataMan::play_time` rising is the game itself saying the world is simulating. It is
///     flat during loads -- this repo detects load boundaries BY that flatness
///     (`er_telemetry_core::read::epoch`) -- so it cannot be true during the load the cover is for.
///   * the local player carrying a loaded character. The same class of read as the render-ready
///     path that DEMONSTRABLY kept working throughout the failure
///     (`release_render_ready_seen = 1` is exactly such a read succeeding).
///
/// The wall clock is the second arm and the pure last resort: it is the only one left when the
/// world clock itself cannot be read at all.
///
/// IT CANNOT PREEMPT A HEALTHY RELEASE. `release_reachable` is `world_handoff`; while that is true

/// ONE-WAY RELEASE FADE (user report 2026-08-22, second round: "I still see my portrait come back

/// THE MECHANISM, confirmed in source rather than assumed. `native_gfx_hold_pending` is rebuilt
/// every frame from two RECENCY predicates -- a Scaleform fade-out stamped within
/// `BOOT_VIEW_NATIVE_GFX_FADEOUT_HOLD_MS`, or a `CS::LoadingScreen::Update` tick within
/// `BOOT_VIEW_NATIVE_LOADING_QUIET_HOLD_MS`. Neither can become true again on its own as time
/// passes; both need a FRESH stamp. One of the two writers takes any stamp at all:
/// `scaleform_label_goto_hook` calls `stamp_loading_gfx_fadeout` for ANY timeline label merely
/// CONTAINING "fadeout", on ANY movie, matched case-insensitively (`bounded_ascii_contains`
/// lowercases). Opening the in-world menu is enough, and that is measured rather than assumed: of
/// the 106 vanilla menu `.gfx` movies in the local extraction, 98 carry a frame label literally
/// named `FadeOut` -- including `02_000_ingametop.gfx`, the pause menu Escape opens, whose label
/// table reads `FadeIn` / `Loop` / `FadeOut`, and `01_000_fe.gfx`, the HUD that fades out when it
/// does. So this stamp is not a loading-screen signal at all; almost any menu transition refreshes
/// it. The hold then re-asserts mid-fade and the old code fell through to the OPAQUE cover path,
/// which rasterizes with
/// `draw_portrait: true` where the fade frame is built with `draw_portrait: false` -- so the head
/// was not riding the fade down, it was being re-drawn at full alpha, and then the fade finished
/// and took it away again. Reappear and tear down, exactly as reported.
///
/// THE RULE. The hold was written as a START GATE ("is it safe to begin fading yet?") and it is now
/// only asked as one. Once `BOOT_VIEW_FADE_START_MS` is set, the fade owns the rest of the window
/// and can never hand it back to the opaque path. But the gate is not simply switched off, because
/// it defends a real case: fading out while the game's own loading screen is still on the
/// backbuffer is the vanilla flash-through (er-effects-rs-wmw defect #1). So the two halves are
/// separated by what they can actually prove:
///
///   * the Scaleform half is a start gate ONLY. It cannot tell the loading screen's own fade from
///     a menu's, and the over-match is documented at both the hook and the release predicate.
///   * the `CS::LoadingScreen::Update` half stays live during the fade, but only for ticks past
///     `BOOT_VIEW_FADE_START_LS_UPDATE_HITS`. Only the loading-screen detour writes that counter, so
///     a tick past the snapshot IS the game's loading screen running again, with no ambiguity.
///
/// A honored hold PAUSES the fade at its current alpha (see [`boot_view_fade_hold_tick`]) instead of
/// cancelling it, so the cover stays as opaque as it already was, never brighter, and the full ramp
/// still plays once the loading screen goes quiet.
///
/// WHY A GENUINE HOLD IS ALMOST UNREACHABLE HERE, and why that is not an argument for skipping it.
/// The fade only starts once the loading screen has been quiet for 900 ms, and a genuinely new load
/// re-arms the cover window -- `boot_view_reset_cover_window` clears `BOOT_VIEW_FADE_START_MS`, so
/// "mid-fade" cannot survive into a new load. The honored path is therefore expected to stay at 0,
