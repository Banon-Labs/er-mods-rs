//! D3D12 Present overlay -- draw the captured now-loading portrait directly onto the swapchain
//! backbuffer, bypassing the Scaleform/TexRepository pipeline entirely.
//!
//! The in-pipeline routes (forge bake, re-forge, CS-texture upload) cannot drive the DISPLAYED image:
//! the forge pre-binds before the portrait renders (timing race) and Scaleform samples its own decoded
//! GFx-renderer texture copy distinct from the CS-side texture we can reach (see bd
//! `postcontinue-portrait-EXHAUSTIVE-2026-06-30`). This is the sanctioned native D3D12/game-render-layer
//! path: hook `IDXGISwapChain::Present`, and when the now-loading screen is up, copy the captured portrait
//! over the backbuffer.
//!
//! Phase 1 (this commit): install the Present hook via the standard dummy-swapchain vtable technique and
//! log that it fires + the backbuffer format/dims. NO backbuffer writes yet (lowest crash risk) -- proves
//! the hook mechanism before adding the draw.
