/// # Why every direct call has to come through here
///
/// A detour installed by `er-hook` already asks: it translates a known 1.16.2 address for the
/// running build, or REFUSES, which is why a moved function now produces a log line instead of a
/// corrupted image. A hand-built function pointer asks nothing. On ELDEN RING 1.17 it transfers
/// control into whatever now occupies the 1.16.2 address -- routinely the middle of an unrelated
/// function, which faults with no unwind information and an exception record naming nothing of
/// ours. That is the WORSE of the two failures: a refused detour makes one feature inert and says
/// so, a stale call takes the process down.
///
/// A MAPPED constant is not safer this way. The map knows exactly where the function went;
/// `base + rva` simply never asks it.
