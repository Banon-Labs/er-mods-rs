// ===== SAVE-SAFE verify-only OWN-LOAD buffer-feed probe (bd er-effects-rs-lds) ===============
//
// MECHANISM (static-validated 2026-06-22): hook the FSM-gated save read 0x67b100(rcx=out_buf,
// edx=size). When the one-shot gate `OWN_LOAD_GATE` is set, memcpy our sliced PLAINTEXT BND4 slot
// body (from `er_save_loader::bnd4::slot_body`) into out_buf for min(edx, body.len()) bytes and
// return al=1; otherwise call the original. Then call the native parser 0x67b290(slot) in-process
// UNCHANGED -- it allocs the buffer, invokes our hooked 0x67b100 (gets our bytes), and runs the
// REAL native parse (c30 write 0x67bd70 + stream deserialize + char-apply) with zero
// re-implementation. The gate is MANDATORY: 0x67b100 is SHARED with the native menu loader (4
// callers, only one is ours); we must never intercept the menu path. VERIFY is read-back only:
// GameMan+0xc30 (map id) + the PlayerGameData fingerprint. NO SetState5, NO autosave.

/// FSM-gated save read 0x67b100(rcx=out_buf, edx=size) -> al. The leaf read helper our parser
/// 0x67b290 invokes (and the native menu loader -- hence the mandatory gate).

/// One-shot gate: true ONLY for the single 0x67b290(slot) call we make from `own_load_drive`. The

/// ```
///
/// The load side never releases itself: `FUN_140e6e080` case 0x14 with a zero `param_2` --
/// exactly the shape the b80 poll `0x679180(0, 0)` produces -- returns 0 having called
/// nothing, and it is that return which drives `GameMan+0xb80` to RESIDENT(3). So the
/// switch reload's SUBMIT -> DRAIN(b80 == 3) sequence ends with a COMPLETED load still
/// holding `iodev+0x18`/`+0x20`, and the release is owed by the very call this detour was
/// substituting. Swallowing it outright left that job in the slot forever, and the submit
/// builders gate on `iodev+0x10 == 0 && iodev+0x20 == 0` -- so after one profile switch NO
/// save in the process could be built again: not autosave, not rest, not quit-save, not the
/// Save Game row. The measured signature was `oracle_save_dispatch_last_decline_reason =

// ===== WorldBlockRes::Update DIAGNOSTIC detour (worldblockres-phase-machine-drives-loadstate-to-0xa)
//
// PURPOSE: discriminate WHY the requested map block never reaches loadstate phase 0xa on the menu-free
// OWN-LOAD path. `WorldBlockRes::Update` (deobf 0x140614870) is the per-block phase state-machine
// (switch on the phase byte [this+0x35]); the 9->0xa transition fires ONLY when the FD4 file-load
// completion gate [this+0x2f]!=0. It is ticked per-block-per-frame by the FieldArea/WorldAreaRes
// block-update loop (FUN_14062f840 / FUN_14063a930) which our menu-free path may never run.
//
// The detour is OBSERVE-ONLY: it bumps a call counter, reads the phase byte ([+0x35]) and the gate
// byte ([+0x2f]) via FAULT-TOLERANT reads (never derefs raw), tracks the MAX phase seen and whether
// ANY block's gate was set, then calls the original (trampoline) and returns its return value
// UNCHANGED. No per-call logging (this is high-rate: ~33 blocks * per-frame) -- only atomics.

// 1.16.2 dump: STEP_MoveMap_Finish (0x140aec050) lists callee `_Common_Finalize@140aed380`, whose body
// frees GLOBAL_WorldChrMan, GLOBAL_CSDistViewManager (LOD), g_GxDrawContext (FUN_1419eaf90),
// GLOBAL_CSBulletManager/DmgMan/MapItemMan, WorldRes::ResetAreaInfoLists, unloads the loadlistlist
// FileCaps, and sets CSHavokMan+0x90+0x74; it uses the literal EventFlagCaller name
// "CS::InGameStep::_Common_Finalize". It DLPanics on null world singletons, so it is called ONLY when a
// live world exists -> it never fires on the boot autoload (load1) and increments once per SWITCH reload.
//
// DO NOT trust scripts/dump-deobf-shift.py for this VA: it FALSELY reports 0x140aed380 -> 0x140aed290

// STEP_MoveMap_Finish). The prior RVA 0xaed290 made MinHook write a 5-byte jmp over FUN_140aed270's live

// ===== STEP_WorldResWait streaming-settle DEFER-RELEASE hook (armed switch-reload dip fix) ==========
//
// ROOT (bd reload-overlap-fix-design-worldreswait-defer-release-on-streaming-settle-2026-07-24, RE
// synthesis Candidate A, ermaporch 1.16.2): the armed in-place switch reload releases movability at
// CS::MoveMapStep::STEP_WorldResWait (dump 0x140af9cf0) the instant the target WorldBlockRes reaches
// residency phase 0xa -- which does NOT wait on CS::CSWorldGeomMan geometry streaming. Because the mod's
// lightweight return-title SKIPS _Common_Finalize (persistent world), the geometry re-stream is deferred
// PAST that residency release, so the player becomes movable WHILE CSWorldGeomMan is still streaming =
// the ~20fps movable-while-streaming dip (stream_overlap oracle: epoch2 5/5 overlap @20fps).
//
// FIX LEVER: STEP_WorldResWait gates its ENTIRE ready branch (player warp FUN_140622d20 +0xb7b0/b7b8=pos
// +0xb7c0=1, and step advance FUN_140af9d90 requestedState++) on `FUN_140624bd0(fieldArea) != 0`. That
// gate (deobf 0x624bd0, byte-identical to the dump; the shift tool's -0xe0/-0xf0 is a FALSE match in this
// low-.text region -- resolved instead by unique prologue byte-search) is called EXCLUSIVELY from
// STEP_WorldResWait (xrefs: 1 code caller + 1 table ref), so hooking it affects ONLY the WorldResWait
// release and nothing else. While a switch reload is ARMED and geometry has not settled, we return AL=0
// (not-ready) so STEP_WorldResWait takes its OWN not-ready branch (native _CheckEternityLoading pumps the
// loading cover; no warp, no advance), then release with AL=1 once CSWorldGeomMan settles for K frames.
//
// SAFETY / why this is the safe hook point (vs faking the inner residency predicate FUN_14066d3e0, which
// has 3 callers, or hooking STEP_WorldResWait itself, whose true deobf entry the shift tool mis-resolves):
//   * We NEVER write WorldBlockRes phase/gate bytes (+0x35/+0x2f/+0x2d) -- the block reaches genuine
//     residency in its real object; we only defer the STEP transition the game keys on the gate's return.
//   * BEFORE residency we call the original every frame (identical to native: maintenance runs, residency
//     progresses), so the fix can never PREVENT residency from being reached.
//   * The original's ready path calls FUN_14066d610 (a NON-idempotent worldres pending-vector erase +
//     block+0x2c clear) exactly ONCE, on the first residency frame -- so once residency is SEEN we STOP
//     calling the original (returning our own hold value) to avoid repeat-popping/corrupting that vector.
//   * SCOPE (all three, else pure passthrough): worldreswait_hold_enabled() (default-OFF opt-in marker,
//     evaluated at arm) && switch_reload_active() (phase >= RETURN_TITLE_REQUESTED; IDLE on boot/load1) &&
//     SYSTEM_QUIT_ARM_PLAYER_WAS_ABSENT==0 (in-world switch, not a boot self-reload) && a per-switch ARM
//     latch set only from own_load_switch_reload_fire. On boot/load1 nothing arms -> pure passthrough (the
//     PHASE3 load1-softlock trap is avoided: we do NOT key on FRESH_DESER_COUNT, which fires on load1).
//   * BOUNDED FAIL-SOFT: if CSWorldGeomMan never settles within WORLDRESWAIT_HOLD_WAIT_MAX frames, release
//     anyway (today's in-place behavior) and latch RELEASED_ON_FAILSOFT -- a stalled settle can never
//     softlock the switch.

    // save is staged/redirected via DLL config / `ER_QUICKLOAD_SAVE_FILE`, read THAT file directly instead of the
    // native-builder + `fs::read_dir` path below. Reasons this is the correct + robust source:
    //   * It is the EXACT file the CreateFileW redirect rewrites the game's save I/O onto (root +
    //     `EldenRing/<steamid>/ER0000.sl2`), so its bytes are what the game itself reads/writes.
    //   * It is PRE-POPULATED before launch, so the read never depends on the game's save-dir being
    //     written yet -- the timing coupling that softlocked the switch when the portrait pipeline's
    //     per-frame slack was removed (the feed-deserialize fired before any save existed and the
    //     native builder's real AppData dir was empty because the redirect bypasses `read_dir`).
    //   * The native builder returns the real `AppData\Roaming\EldenRing\<steamid>` dir, which the
    //     redirect does NOT cover for directory enumeration -> `read_dir` saw an empty dir and the
    //     confirm blocked (lib.rs:198: the DLL must never read the default user save dir).
    // Same std::fs access the redirect enforcer already uses successfully from this DLL under Proton
    // (save_redirect::save_override_redirect_root_w). The full multi-slot save is returned; the
    // caller slices the picked slot exactly as it does for the native-builder bytes.
    //
    // RUNTIME FOREIGN PICK OVERRIDE (Load-Save-Profiles pick-override fix, er-quickload, 2026-07-15):
    // When the human-driven "Load Save Profiles" path has COMMITTED a foreign slot this switch,
    // `system_quit_save_swap_prepare_selected_slot` has already overwritten the game-owned ACTIVE
    // `%APPDATA%/EldenRing/<steamid>/ER0000.{sl2,co2}` file with the picked slot's bytes (and re-committed
    // it after the return-title save). Those committed bytes -- NOT the configured `save_file` -- are what
    // the user just picked, so the feed MUST read the committed file here. The configured `save_file`
    // stays the INITIAL boot autoload default (it wins only when no runtime pick is committed): reading it
    // over a fresh foreign commit is exactly the pick-override bug (preview showed the picked character but
    // the game loaded the config default). Read the committed path DIRECTLY -- same std::fs source as the
    // configured-direct branch below -- because in direct mode the CreateFileW redirect does not cover the
    // native builder's `read_dir` enumeration (see the native-builder note below), so relying on the dir
    // walk to observe the just-committed bytes is timing/redirect fragile.
    // RUNTIME CROSS-FILE OVERRIDE (programmatic (file,slot) switch, 2026-07-18). The harness sets the
    // target save FILE for THIS switch via a game-dir control file (er-quickload-switch-save-file.txt = a
    // Windows path the game can open, e.g. A:\...\150-Banon\ER0000.sl2). Read it FIRST so a programmatic
    // cross-file switch loads an ARBITRARY vanilla file READ-ONLY, in-memory (the source is only read;
    // the caller slices the picked slot exactly like the boot TOML save_file path). Absent/empty -> fall
