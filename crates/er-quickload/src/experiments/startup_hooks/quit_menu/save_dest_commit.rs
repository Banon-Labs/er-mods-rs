//! Product facade for the save-destination commit window, whose implementation moved to
//! `er_quit_menu_core::save_dest_commit_runtime`.
//!
//! Pure code reorganization, no behavior change. Two inputs stay on this side of the boundary and
//! are supplied here rather than through the seam, in the same style as the S7
//! `save_dest_accepted_paths_for(live, native_dir)` split:
//!
//! * `save_redirect_native_source_dir()` -- owned by `experiments::save_redirect`, which stays in
//!   the product (see the roadmap's R32 rebaseline).
//! * the SL save-job body observer -- owned by `er-save-suppress`, which the quit-menu crate
//!   deliberately does not link (`crates/er-quit-menu-core/Cargo.toml` boundary note). The three
//!   counters are handed over as function pointers, so the moved code still reads each one at the
//!   exact point it always did.
