// S7 moved the pure row-decision core to `er-quit-menu-core::rows`; this slice moved the live
// memory-capture and telemetry half to `er-quit-menu-core::row_identity`. What is left here is the
// product facade: the two reads whose offsets belong to `er_title_flow` (the dialog slot CURSOR and
// slot BOUND) are performed on this side and handed over as values, and the row-table reset stays
// because it also tears down the build-url editor, whose 02_990 field lives in the product.
