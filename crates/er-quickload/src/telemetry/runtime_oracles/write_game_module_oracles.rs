// The game-module oracle emission spine.
//
// This file used to hold the whole 3,206-line emission as a single function. It is now the ORDER
// that emission happens in, and nothing else: each subsystem lives in its own `oracles_*.rs`
// sibling and is called from here. Order is load-bearing -- the telemetry JSON is read positionally
// by nothing, but a reader diffing two runs relies on the field order being stable -- so the calls
// below are in exactly the sequence the fields were emitted in before the split.
//
// The seams were chosen where the source already had them: at every boundary below, at most one
// local value flows onward, and those two are returned/passed explicitly rather than recomputed.
