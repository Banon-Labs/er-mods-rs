//! MinHook FFI + hook union for this DLL.
//!
//! The generic implementation (the `MH_*` externs, `MH_STATUS`, the `MhHook` wrapper, and the union:
//! `register_union_hook` + the cross-DLL chaining) moved to the shared `er-hook` crate so all three
//! game cdylibs share one copy and MinHook's C source is compiled once. This module re-exports it, so
//! every existing `crate::mh::{MhHook, MH_*, MH_STATUS, register_union_hook, ...}` reference is
//! unchanged.
//!
//! The `#[no_mangle] er_effects_union_register` C export stays HERE (not in `er-hook`): it is a
//! cross-DLL contract other DLLs resolve by name, and keeping it in this crate ensures ONLY
//! `er_quickload.dll` exports it -- exactly as before the extraction.

/// companion drove its OWN MinHook instance, two instances patching the same address would corrupt
/// each other's trampolines (the exact silent race the internal union was built to fix, now across
/// DLLs). So the companion calls THIS export instead: every shared address is owned by this DLL's
/// single MinHook instance + union, and the companion's handler is CHAINED like any internal one.
///
/// `orig_slot_ptr` points at a `usize`-sized cell (an `AtomicUsize`) that lives in the COMPANION's
