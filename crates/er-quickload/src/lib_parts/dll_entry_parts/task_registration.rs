    // RE-GROUNDED ON 1.17 (2026-09-04). The reading below was originally decompiled off the 1.16.2
    // dump on :8765; the INSTALLED game is 1.17. Every address here is now measured on the 1.17
    // dump (:8767, `proj1170`) and identity-checked against `eldenring-deobf-1.17.bin`
    // (`check-dump-deobf-identity.py` -> MATCH, shift 0). The 1.16.2 addresses are kept only as the
    // pairing evidence, never as current.
    //
    // The evaluator is `FUN_140afb9f0` on 1.17 (1.16.2: `FUN_140afa6d0`; the `FUN_140afa7c0` this
    // comment used to name is not a function entry on EITHER build -- it lands 0xf0 inside the
    // 1.16.2 one). Paired by the unique wide literal `L"CSEzSelectBot.MoveMapStep"` -- 1.16.2
    // `0x142b60758`, 1.17 `0x142b637f8` -- which both functions reference at the SAME +0xc1 from
    // entry, with the SAME body size (4491). The byte mapper cannot carry this address: it reports
    // UNRESOLVED (111 shape matches, none at the nearest anchor delta), so the literal is the proof.
    //
    // Measured on 1.17, at instruction level:
    //   * `MOV byte ptr [RAX + 0x5e], BL` @ `0x140afbd0c` -- the write, UNCONDITIONAL and ahead of
    //     the switch, so it happens on every call.
    //   * `MOVZX EAX, byte ptr [RAX + 0x5d]` -- +0x5d feeds the same disjunction it always did.
    //   * `RAX` is `*(CSMenuMan + 8)` (menuData); CSMenuMan global = `0x143d6f820` on 1.17.
    //   * `switch (*(param_1 + 0x12a)) { case 0: if (cVar == 0) return; ... }` -- the finalize
    //     driver, unchanged. `case 8` calls `FUN_14067bcf0(0)`, which is `*(GameMan + 0x10) = 0`:
    //     the warp really is consumed there.
    //   * `warpRequested` is read by `FUN_14067a660` = `return *(GameMan + 0x10)`, so
    //     `GAME_MAN_WARP_REQUESTED_10_OFFSET = 0x10` holds on 1.17.
    //
    // So while warpRequested==1 the flag is the live finalize driver and clearing it SABOTAGES the
    // finalize. Once case 8 has consumed the warp (warpRequested 1->0) nothing re-evaluates the
    // flag and it stays 1 RESIDUAL.
    //
    // That makes this a residual SCRUB, not a suppression: if any genuine end condition still holds,
    // the native evaluator re-asserts 0x5e on its very next frame. The residual is only reachable
    // BECAUSE the evaluator has stopped.
    //
    // WHAT THE SCRUB CANNOT RACE (measured on both builds, 2026-09-04). Scanning every RIP-relative
    // load of the CSMenuMan global (779 sites on each build) and decoding 100 instructions forward,
    // `menuData+0x5e` is touched by exactly TWO instructions per build -- one write and one read:
    //   1.16.2  write `0x140afa9ec` (evaluator)      read `0x140844023`
    //   1.17    write `0x140afbd0c` (evaluator)      read `0x140845013`
    // The evaluator is the ONLY writer, which is what makes a scrub safe: nothing else can be
    // mid-write, and the evaluator overwrites us next frame whenever it is still running.
    //
    // THE REVERT IS NOT CAUSED BY THIS FLAG. MEASURED, NOT INFERRED (2026-09-04).
    //
    // This comment used to claim "STEP_EndFlow reads that as return-to-title -> SetState(6 -> 2)".
    // That is false on both builds, and the real decider has now been read end to end.
    //
    // A `SetState(owner, 2=BeginLogo)` from committed=6 comes from `STEP_GameStepWait`
    // (1.16.2 `0x140b0cde0` / 1.17 `FUN_140b0e480`, both size 437, delta +0x16a0; the 1.17 one
    // identity-checked against the image, shift 0). Its ENTIRE decision is three reads:
    //
    //     if (InGameStep->requestCode_0xd8 == 0) {        // else: returns, no SetState at all
    //       if (GameMan+0xb7c == 0) {                     // else: state 7
    //         if (GameMan+0xb7d == 0) -> state 2 BeginLogo // else: state 9
    //
    // `menuData+0x5e` does not appear. `CS::TitleStep::STEP_EndFlow` (1.16.2 `0x140b0cc00`) never
    // references the byte either, and the ONLY reader of it anywhere reachable through the CSMenuMan
    // global is `AddEntry(SummonMsgQueue*, SummonMsgData*)` (1.16.2 `0x140843f70` /
    // 1.17 `0x140844f60`, both size 398, read at the same +0xa3), which merely refuses to enqueue a
    // summon message while the flag is set.
    //
    // WHY THE WRONG SUSPECT LOOKED GUILTY: the `title-setstate-trace` line that motivated the theory
    // logged `warp/b73/bc4/md5d/md5e` and NOT `b7c`/`b7d` -- it sampled the MoveMapStep evaluator's
    // inputs, not GameStepWait's. md5e was simply the only logged field that was set. That line now
    // also logs `GAMESTEPWAIT[req_d8, b7c, b7d]`, so the next run names the branch instead of us
    // guessing.
    //
    // CONSEQUENCE FOR THIS SCRUB: it is safe (single writer, re-asserted next frame while the
    // evaluator runs) but it is NOT the fix for the revert. To hold off BeginLogo during the
    // streaming window the lever is `InGameStep+0xd8 != 0` -- which skips the SetState branch
    // entirely -- not this byte. Left in place rather than ripped out, because it is harmless and
    // removing it is a behaviour change that deserves its own runtime run; do not cite it as the
    // black-screen fix.
    //
    // Scan caveat, unchanged: the reader search only sees code that reaches menuData THROUGH the
    // global, so a callee handed the pointer as an argument would be missed.
    //
    // The old `mms_step == -1 && request_code == MOVEMAP_PENDING` shape is exactly the class of
    // over-gating the sibling clear already had to delete: its own comment records "run 1707: the
    // clear fired 0 times because the mms>=18/player sub-gate excluded that frame". The 2026-09-04
    // revert frame reported `req_code=0(NONE)` (gm-snap `ig_d8` 2 -> 0 across +2042168..+2043687),
    // so that shape would have missed it too. Keep it only as an additional trigger, never as a
    // requirement.
    //
    // `md_5d == 0` stays the SAFETY discriminator and is what makes this poll safe to run always:
    // a genuine user/return-title request carries BOTH flags (measured: the intended switch teardown
    // at +2028671ms logged `md5d=1 md5e=1`, the spurious revert at +2043697ms logged `md5d=0
    // md5e=1`), so a real return-to-title is never scrubbed.
