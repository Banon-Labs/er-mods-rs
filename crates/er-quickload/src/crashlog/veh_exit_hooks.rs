/// were quarantined on that inference before the crash log was read properly (it held 8 records,
/// every one `fatal=false`). The crash log cannot settle it either -- `note_process_detach` says so
/// in its own doc comment: a detach with no fatal record means "shut down OR killed from outside".
///
/// THE EXIT CODE DOES NOT SEPARATE THEM ON THIS TARGET. That was this file's first design and it
/// was wrong: the user quit to desktop and the run was recorded as `fault`, because a normal
/// ELDEN RING quit under Wine/Proton exits through `NtTerminateProcess` carrying `0xc0000005` --
/// the same code an access violation would carry. An exit code is not a diagnosis here.
///
/// What DOES separate them is whether an exception went UNHANDLED, which is the one thing a
/// first-chance handler structurally cannot tell you and the only thing that means "the process is
/// dying BY this fault". So [`fatal_exception_filter`] stamps the file the moment the top-level
/// filter is reached, and that stamp wins:
///
/// * `fatal-exception` -- an exception reached the unhandled filter. This one really crashed.
/// * `clean-exit` -- an exit path ran with code 0.
/// * `exit-unclassified` -- an exit path ran with a non-zero code and NO fatal exception was seen.
///   Recorded verbatim and left uninterpreted, because on this target that is what a quit looks
///   like. Across every run of 2026-08-28 the fatal filter fired ZERO times while several runs
///   exited `0xc0000005`; reading those as crashes produced a bisect whose verdicts were noise.
///
/// The file is also written ONCE AT INSTALL as `outcome=running`, which is what makes its later
/// states readable. Without that, two very different things looked identical -- the process being
/// killed from outside, and these hooks never installing at all -- and a reader has no way to tell
/// which. So:
///
/// * `running`, after the process is gone -- no exit path ran: killed from outside (an agent
///   teardown, `wineserver`, the OOM killer) or died without reaching any exit API.
