//! This crate must never answer a `CS::MessageBoxDialog` for the player.
//!
//! The DLL is compiled several ways. The default set carries the boot autoload, which drives the
//! front end before a player exists; `--no-default-features --features quit-rows,menu-trace`
//! carries menu rows and nothing that loads. The pressing code did not know the difference. It
//! hung off `!product_autoload_enabled()` -- a flag the boot autoload arms at `DllMain` -- so it
//! was off in the build that drives the menus itself and on in the build where a person drives
//! them.
//!
//! The cost was measured rather than argued. Run br-20260913-154820-c63f, the rows-only build:
//! `msgbox-builder #0 ... captured=true in_world=false` at +13980ms, `auto-accept: OK-handler
//! 0x14078eeb0 ... real OK-press` 13 ms later, the closing latch at +14010ms, and at +14502ms the
//! message that box carried -- `GetGR_System_Message id=401106`, save data is corrupted. The
//! player was told nothing.
//!
//! A deletion cannot be proven by a run -- nothing happens, and nothing happening is what every
//! broken build also looks like. So it is pinned here instead: the source may capture a dialog,
//! and may read its fields, and may not press anything on it. Comments are stripped before the
//! scan, so the notes left where the deleted code used to live do not re-arm the rule they
//! describe.
