// DLC VIRTUAL ROOT BLANK/REFILL TRACE -- why the reload's roots stay empty.
//
// MOVED VERBATIM out of the product DLL's
// `crates/er-quickload/src/experiments/startup_hooks/diagnostics/dlc_roots_trace.rs` on
// 2026-08-25. There all three detours were installed UNCONDITIONALLY at process attach for a log
// nothing in the product read back. The bodies, the sampling order and every log string are
// unchanged; only the sink moved and the counters are now this crate's own.
//
// ONE SOFT COUPLING SURVIVES THE MOVE, and it is deliberate. `er-title-flow`'s DLC-root self-heal
// (`crates/er-title-flow/src/dlc_roots_self_heal.rs`) prefers `DLC_ROOTS_REFILL_ORIG` -- the
// trampoline THIS trace used to store -- over resolving the refill's RVA, so that the heal does not
// re-enter our own detour. Rust statics are per-DLL, so with the trace in a second image the
// product's copy stays 0 and the heal takes its existing fallback: `game_rva(DLC_ROOTS_REFILL_RVA)`.
// In a product-only profile that is the un-detoured native and the behaviour is identical. In a
// product + harness profile the heal enters this detour, which samples the roots and forwards to
// its own trampoline -- one extra log line, no recursion, and the trace now also SEES the heal's
// refill, which is strictly more informative than the old arrangement.
//
// The reload softlock is a blanked DLC virtual root: at the stall `mapstudio_dlc2` is `""` while the
// base-game `mapstudio` still resolves, so the m28 msb read returns 0 bytes (bd
// `PROVEN-reload-softlock-is-blanked-dlc-virtual-root-mapstudio-dlc2-empty-2026-07-30`).
//
// Two functions own that state, and this traces BOTH so one run says which ran and which did not:
//
//   BLANK   FUN_140e06490(CSDlcImp*, true) -- re-registers the 13 `*_dlc2` aliases with root L"" and
//           clears ~50 DLC ownership flags. Sole code caller: the title start-game flow FUN_1409b24e0.
//   REFILL  FUN_140e05fb0(CSDlcImp*, true) -- re-queries Steam DLC ownership and calls
//           CSDlcImp::AddVirtualFileRoots, restoring mapstudio_dlc2 -> "map_dlc2:/mapstudio".
//
// WHY THE REFILL ENTRY AND NOT ITS CALLERS: FUN_140e05fb0 has two callers --
// CS::MoveMapListStep::STEP_LoadListWait and the title-flow job body FUN_1408371e0 -- and a measured
// run has already shown STEP_LoadListWait executes ZERO times, even on a load that SUCCEEDS. So the
// live refill arrives via the title-flow job, and hooking the shared entry counts every refill
// attempt regardless of path, with no need to guess which. It also avoids FUN_1408371e0's
// rip-relative prologue (`mov rcx,[rip+...]` at +4).
//
// Both prologues are clean pushes/stores with no rip-relative operand in the patch window
// (`40 55 56 57 41 56 41 57 48 83 ec 70` and `48 89 74 24 10 57 48 83 ec 20`), so a 5-byte detour
// relocates safely.
//
// These are TRACES: they forward unconditionally and write only our own counters. Roots are sampled
// BEFORE and AFTER each call, so a single line shows the transition (`ok -> EMPTY` for the blank,
// `EMPTY -> ok` for a refill that worked, `EMPTY -> EMPTY` for one that ran but achieved nothing --
// which would move the blame to the DLC ownership re-query rather than to dispatch).
