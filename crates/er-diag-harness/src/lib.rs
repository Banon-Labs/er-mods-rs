//! er-diag-harness -- standalone Elden Ring AGENT DIAGNOSTIC TRACE HARNESS.
//!
//! A separate cdylib (`er_diag_harness.dll`), loaded as its own `[[natives]]` entry in the ME3
//! profile ALONGSIDE the product. Its mere PRESENCE enables it (DEFAULT-ON, no env var and no
//! marker file, the `er-input-harness` contract); omit it from the profile for production.
//!
//! WHY IT EXISTS. Five MinHook detours -- three traces' worth -- used to be installed
//! UNCONDITIONALLY by the shipping `er_quickload.dll`, from `DllMain` ->
//! `install_profile_and_system_quit_hooks` -> `install_system_quit_duplicate_button_hook`, with no
//! gate of any kind:
//!
//! | address    | what it is                                   | how often it fires        |
//! |------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
//! | `0x21bbf0` | the SOLE `MsbFileCap::msbResCap` writer       | once per MSB, every boot  |
//! | `0xaf1800` | `CS::MoveMapListStep::STEP_LoadListWait`      | every frame               |
//! | `0xe06490` | DLC virtual-root BLANK (`FUN_140e06490`)      | per title start-game pass |
//! | `0xe05fb0` | DLC virtual-root REFILL (`FUN_140e05fb0`)     | per refill attempt        |
//! | `0x836f30` | the refill JOB BODY (`FUN_140836f30`)         | per job dispatch          |
//!
//! Every one of them is observe-and-forward, and NONE of them feeds an `oracle_*` field -- so
//! nothing in the product read the results back either. They were pure agent diagnostics riding in
//! a player's process. They now ride here.
//!
//! CROSS-DLL STATE: separate DLLs do not share Rust statics, so this shell carries its own counters
//! and its own trampoline slots and re-derives everything else by reading GAME memory directly
//! (`er_game_base::filecap`). It reads no product static and calls no product function. The one
//! place the old arrangement leaked across that line is documented in `dlc_roots_trace.rs`.
//!
//! MINHOOK IS PER-PROCESS, THE GUARDS ARE PER-DLL. `MH_Initialize` / `MH_ApplyQueued` operate on
//! one process-wide MinHook state, but the `*_INSTALLED` atomics below are this image's own, so
//! they cannot deduplicate against the product's. That is safe only because the product no longer
//! hooks any of these five addresses -- which is the whole point of the move, and is checked by
//! `scripts/check-shared-hook-rvas.py`.

// EVERYTHING BELOW THE ENTRY POINT IS WINDOWS-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION -- a MinHook detour on a game
// RVA, a walk over live game memory, a log file beside `eldenring.exe`. So the modules are
// `cfg(windows)` rather than compiled-with-their-callers-removed, which is what the sibling shells
// need the blanket `cfg_attr(not(windows), allow(dead_code, unused_imports))` for. Here the host
// build is the `DllMain` stub and nothing else, and it is warning-CLEAN under the workspace
// `[workspace.lints.rust] warnings = "deny"` -- so no allow is carried, and real host debt would
// show up instead of being hidden.
