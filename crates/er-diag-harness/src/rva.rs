//! The addresses and log budgets the three traces own, moved verbatim out of the product's
//! `crates/er-effects-rs/src/constants/autoload_state.rs`.
//!
//! They moved WITH the code rather than being copied: one game address must have exactly one
//! literal declaration (`scripts/check-rva-alias-drift.py`), because divergent names for one
//! address are divergent claims about what it is. `DLC_ROOTS_REFILL_RVA` is the exception --
//! `er-title-flow`'s DLC-root self-heal also names it, so it already lives in the shared
//! `er_game_base::rva` table and is referenced from there by both.
