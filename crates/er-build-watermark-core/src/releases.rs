//! Where "behind main" comes from: the published `main-*` release tags, newest first.
//!
//! # Why GitHub at all
//!
//! A DLL cannot know its position in history from its own bytes. It knows the commit it was
//! built from -- that is baked in -- but "is that commit still the tip" is a question only the
//! repository can answer, and the release list is the cheapest form of the answer: the tags ARE
//! the commits (`main-<40 hex>`), so nothing has to be downloaded or opened to read them.
//!
//! # One request, off the game thread, failing open
//!
//! A single GET on a background thread at startup. If it fails -- offline, rate-limited, GitHub
//! down -- the list stays empty and every build renders as `Standing::Unknown`, which is drawn
//! quietly and never red. A watermark that turned red because a network call failed would be
//! worse than no watermark: it would teach the reader that red means nothing.
