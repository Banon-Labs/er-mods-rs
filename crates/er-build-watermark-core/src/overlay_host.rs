//! Who owns the swapchain's imgui context, and how everybody else draws on it anyway.
//!
//! # The bug this exists to make impossible
//!
//! hudhook's install latch is a plain `static`, and statics are PER DLL. Two of our modules each
//! calling `Hudhook::apply()` therefore both believe they are first, both hook `Present`, and one
//! of them silently loses every frame from then on. [`claim_owner`] was added to stop that, but
//! it only ever told the LOSER to give up -- it gave the loser nowhere to draw. So the module
//! with the interactive UI could lose the race to a module that draws six words of grey text, and
//! the user would simply find their panel gone.
//!
//! MEASURED 2026-08-25, live, on the user's own session: `er-build-watermark` logged
//! `first render display_width=3840 rows=14` while `er-net-effects` logged
//! `hudhook dx12 overlay installed` and then `hudhook_render_count = 0` -- installed, never
//! rendered, no error anywhere. The interactive bar had been invisible since #336 added the
//! watermark shell, because me3 loads `er_build_watermark.dll` before `er_net_effects.dll` and
//! alphabetical order is not a design.
//!
//! A prior fix had the watermark SLEEP six seconds to let a richer UI claim the context first.
//! That was removed for being a sleep used as synchronization -- correctly -- but the yield it
//! implemented was load-bearing and nothing replaced it. This does, without any sleep.
//!
//! # The shape
//!
//! Exactly one module hosts the render loop; every other module registers a draw callback and the
//! host calls it each frame. Load order stops mattering, because whoever gets there first hosts
//! and everyone else is a guest -- the outcome is the same either way.
//!
//! A guest finds the host by walking the loaded-module list and calling
//! [`REGISTER_EXPORT`] on each. Every shell that links this crate exports it; each
//! implementation registers only if THAT module is the host, so exactly one call answers `true`.
//!
//! # The ABI, and why the tag is not optional
//!
//! The `ui` pointer crosses a DLL boundary as `*const c_void` and is cast back to `&Ui` in the
//! guest. That is only sound while host and guest were built against the SAME imgui, so every
//! registration carries [`OVERLAY_ABI_TAG`] and a host refuses a tag it does not recognise. A
//! refused guest draws nothing, which is a missing panel; accepting a mismatched one would
//! reinterpret an imgui context through the wrong struct layout inside `Present`, which is a
//! crash in the renderer with no useful stack. Missing panel is the better failure, and it logs.
