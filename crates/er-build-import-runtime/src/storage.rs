//! Moving items between the player's pockets and their storage box, through the game's own calls.
//!
//! # Why the importer needs the storage box at all
//!
//! Two reasons, and only the second one is about pots.
//!
//! **The build is a statement about the CHARACTER, not about the backpack.** A grant reconciles
//! to a target -- "this character has three Fire Pots" -- by measuring what is held and adding the
//! shortfall. Until now "what is held" meant the carried inventory alone, so an item sitting in
//! the player's storage box was invisible and a second copy was minted beside it. Asking the box
//! first, and pulling from it when it has one, is the same reconcile with the whole inventory in
//! view.
//!
//! **The box has no pot cap, and the pockets do.** A consumable with an `EquipParamGoods`
//! `potGroupId >= 0` can be carried only up to the number of Cracked Pots sharing that group (see
//! [`crate::catalog::PotGroups`]). The box is exempt, and the exemption is a construction flag
//! rather than a special case in the transfer code:
//! `EquipInventoryData::EquipInventoryData(this, size, keySize, limitedPots, unlimitedConsumables)`
//! (1.16.2 `0x14024bbf0`) has exactly two callers -- the `EquipGameData` constructor at
//! `0x140245485` passes `unlimitedConsumables = 0`, the `PlayerGameData` constructor at
//! `0x14025d879` passes `1`. That flag makes `UpdatePotsStates` return immediately and routes
//! `GetMaxAmountForItem` to `GetMaxItemCountForUnlimitedConsumables` (`0x1406748c0`, 1.17
//! `0x140675710`), which answers `EquipParamGoods.maxRepositoryNum` instead of the group's
//! remaining headroom.
//!
//! So depositing a pot the build does not want DECREMENTS the carried `potItemsCount` for its
//! group and raises the ceiling for the one the build does want. Nothing is destroyed: the
//! displaced pot is in the box, where the player can take it back.
//!
//! # Resolve everything, then act
//!
//! Every native this module needs is resolved in [`Storage::open`], before a single one runs. A
//! transfer that gets half way -- source decremented, destination never credited -- is worse than
//! a transfer that never started, and "the fifth address had no mapping for this build" is
//! exactly the way that happens on a patched game.
//!
//! # The two ways this corrupts a save if it is written carelessly
//!
//! 1. **`reassignQuickSlot` is directional.** When set, the tail of
//!    `TransferItemBetweenInventoryDatas` writes the DESTINATION index into the main player's
//!    quick-slot table. Setting it while depositing points the player's quickbar at a
//!    storage-box index, and that dangling reference persists into the save. It is `false` for
//!    [`Storage::deposit`] and `true` for [`Storage::pull`], and the two are separate functions
//!    partly so the flag cannot be passed by a caller who has to remember which way it goes.
//! 2. **An index is only valid until the next transfer.** The call ends in `AdjustQuantityBy` and
//!    then `RemoveItem` once the stack empties, which reindexes the source inventory. Every
//!    method here re-resolves `GetItemInventoryIdx` immediately before its own transfer and never
//!    accepts an index from a caller.
//!
//! And one that does not corrupt a save but does lose an item's slot: an EQUIPPED entry is never
//! deposited. `EquipGameData.equipmentItemIdxList` (`+0x8`, `int[22]`) holds inventory INDICES,
//! so removing an entry a ChrAsm slot still names leaves that slot pointing at a shifted or freed
//! one. `Storage::is_equipped_index` is the same scan `er-better-refills` runs before its own
//! deposit.
