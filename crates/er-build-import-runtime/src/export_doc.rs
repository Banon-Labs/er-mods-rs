//! Turning a [`CharacterRead`] into the planner document the share link carries.
//!
//! Two separate crates meet here and neither should know about the other: [`crate::read_character`]
//! speaks in `ChrAsmSlot`s and param ids, and `er-build-export` speaks in planner JSON. This module
//! is the only place that knows both, so a change to either side breaks exactly one file.
//!
//! # Everything read is EQUIPPED, so everything emitted is equipped
//!
//! The read is scoped to the loadout, so every armament, armour piece and talisman in a
//! [`CharacterRead`] came out of an equipment slot. Each therefore gets both `equipIndex` and
//! `equipSet` -- the planner writes them together, and an `equipIndex` without a matching
//! `equipSet` describes an item equipped in no set at all.
//!
//! Spells are the exception, and not by omission: the planner gives memorised spells no
//! `equipIndex` at all, only `order`. Their list position IS the memorisation order, which is
//! exactly how the importer reads them back.
//!
//! # Four shapes, not one, and three of them are not slot lists
//!
//! The document does not spell every category the same way, and each difference is a way to write
//! a valid-looking document that describes a different character:
//!
//! | category | where it goes | how the position is spelled |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | armaments, armour, talismans | `inventory` / `protectors.<part>` / `talismans` | `equipIndex` **and** `equipSet` |
//! | spells | `spells.slots` | `order` alone; there is no equip position |
//! | quickbar and pouch | `items.tools.slots` -- ONE list for both | `equipIndex`, `0..10` quickbar and `10..16` pouch, and **no** `equipSet` |
//! | ammunition | `items.ammo` | not a list at all: the KEY is the position and the value is a bare name |
//!
//! The last two rows are the ones that were missing entirely until 2026-08-31. `items.tools` was
//! never assigned, which is one omission costing TWO categories, and `items.ammo` was never
//! assigned either -- so a generated link carried the physick (the one thing under `items` that
//! *was* written) and nothing else, which is exactly what the player reported.
