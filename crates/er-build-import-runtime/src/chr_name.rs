//! Adopting the imported build's name as the CHARACTER's name.
//!
//! # What "inherit the name" can and cannot mean in this game
//!
//! Elden Ring has no rename UI. A character is named once, at creation, and the name then lives in
//! three places inside `PlayerGameData` plus two places on disk. The complete map, established by
//! static RE of the 1.16.2 image on 2026-08-30 and carried to 1.17 through
//! `docs/recon/rva-map-1162-to-1170.needed-verified.tsv`:
//!
//! | where | who reads it | how it is written |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `PGD+0x9c`, `wchar_t[17]` | serialized into the save; this repo's own stats/portrait readers | `CopyChrName`'s copy loop |
//! | `PGD+0x8e8`, `CSWordCheckedStringInternal*` | `FUN_14025f8e0`, and through it `CS::ProfileSummary`'s slot update (`0x140262270`) and `CS::GetPlayerChrName` (the overhead nameplate) | refreshed by `CopyChrName` from `+0x9c` |
//! | `PGD+0x8f8`, a second such string | main-player variant, word-check flag set | refreshed by `CopyChrName` from `+0x9c` |
//! | `CS::ProfileSummary` record `+0x00`, `0x22` bytes | the save-slot list, the title Continue row, the loading-screen portrait | `wcsncpy`'d out of `FUN_14025f8e0` by the game, at every save |
//! | `.sl2` slot body `+0x94`, and `USER_DATA010` record `+0x02` | a container's slot list, including a foreign one | serialized by the game, at every save |
//!
//! Only the first three are ours to touch, and only through the one native below. The last two are
//! the game's to write, and it writes them out of the first three -- which is exactly why this
//! module does not go near them. Storing a name straight into a `ProfileSummary` record is the
//! mistake that nearly persisted the save picker's `[ new ]` row label into a user's container.
//!
//! # So what actually sticks
//!
//! Every surface agrees the moment the name is applied, except the two on-disk ones, which agree at
//! the next save the game performs. Under the product DLL that save is the System>Quit **Save
//! Game** row and nothing else (`er-save-suppress` swallows the rest), so a player who renames and
//! quits without saving comes back to the old name -- correctly, because nothing was saved.
