//! `CS::GaitemLookupResult` -- the record every question about a live item instance goes through.
//!
//! # Why the record has a module rather than a local array of words
//!
//! It is TWENTY bytes, and the only field the ash-of-war answer depends on is the LAST one:
//! `itemId` at `+0x10`. Both readers of a worn armament ask exactly that field --
//! `GaitemLookupResult::canGemBeChanged` (0x1406741b0, reached through
//! `GetGemGaitemHandleFromWeapon`) decides whether the weapon may carry a gem at all, and
//! `GetSwordArtsParamIdForWeapon` turns it into an `EquipParamWeapon` row whose
//! `swordArtsParamId` is the armament's default skill.
//!
//! So a caller that reserves sixteen bytes hands the engine four bytes of somebody else's stack
//! as the item id -- and the resulting failure is silent, and CONSTANT. Zero passes both of the
//! engine's validity tests (`itemId & 0xF0000000 == 0`, and `itemId & 0x0FFFFFFF != 0x0FFFFFFF`),
//! so a zero there does not read as "nothing": it reads as `EquipParamWeapon` **row 0**, unarmed.
//! Every slot then resolves to the same row, `canGemBeChanged` says no, the gem override never
//! runs, and every slot reports one skill. Measured 2026-08-23: eight equipped armaments across
//! five distinct `ChrAsmSlot`s, one answer, `SwordArtsParam` 503 "Kick".
//!
//! Two callers in this crate were building this record independently and only one of them was
//! right. Declaring it once, with its size and its `itemId` offset asserted at compile time, is
//! what makes that class of mistake impossible rather than merely fixed.
//!
//! # The initial state is not zeroes
//!
//! [`GaitemLookupResult::from_handle`] calls the engine's OWN constructor instead of filling the
//! record here, because the constructor is where the initial state is defined and that state is
//! `gaItemIns = nullptr; itemId = -1` before the lookup runs. The `-1` carries as much weight as
//! the size: it is the sentinel both readers test for, so a handle that resolves to nothing
//! reports nothing -- whereas a zero left in that field names a param row.
