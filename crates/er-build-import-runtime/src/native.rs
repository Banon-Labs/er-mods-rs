//! Resolving the game functions this crate CALLS, for the build that is actually running.
//!
//! # Why every call in this crate goes through here
//!
//! Every address in this crate is a 1.16.2 RVA, and the installed game has been 1.17 since
//! 2026-08-27. The old shape was `transmute(module_base + <the RVA>)` under the comment "verified
//! 1.16.2 RVAs within the loaded image" -- a claim that was true when written and became a
//! *stale* claim the day the game patched. There were 38 of them, in four cdylibs including the
//! product DLL, and a call through one is the worst failure mode available: it transfers control
//! into whatever now occupies those bytes, which on a patched build is routinely the middle of an
//! unrelated function -- an execute fault with no unwind information and no exception record
//! naming anything of ours.
//!
//! [`er_game_base::game_build::resolve_game_address`] answers where an address went, or refuses.
//! A refusal costs a feature; using the stale address costs the process. So a refusal here means
//! the caller does not make that call and says so.
//!
//! # Why the log is bounded
//!
//! `resolve_game_address` writes one line per refusal into the shared address log, and this crate
//! adds one line of its own naming the feature that just went inert. That second line is emitted
//! ONCE PER NAME for the life of the process. The bound is not decoration: a session once logged
//! **339,764** refusals of a single address because an unbounded refusal sat inside a recurring
//! task, and the log became unreadable rather than merely long. This crate's callers are one-shot
//! (`tick` claims its phase before it runs), so the natural volume is already small -- the guard
//! is what keeps it small if a future caller is not.
//!
//! # What this is NOT for
//!
//! An address the running process DISCOVERED for itself -- an AOB scan hit, a vtable read, a
//! MinHook trampoline, a captured return address -- is already on the running build and must
//! never be translated. Feeding one to this helper would refuse it (it is not a 1.16.2 source in
//! the table) and cost the feature, or worse, translate it a second time. Nothing in this crate
//! discovers an address that way; every address here is a compile-time 1.16.2 constant.
