//! Sending the gear the build does not name back to the storage box.
//!
//! # The invariant this pass owes
//!
//! Every gear entry the character holds when this pass finishes is a copy the build's grant list
//! names, in no more items of it than that list asks for, and every copy that is not appears by
//! name in this pass's report with the reason it could not be moved.
//!
//! The first two thirds of that are decided by [`er_build_import_core::sweep`], which is host
//! testable and is held to the invariant over generated inventories rather than chosen ones. The
//! last third is this module's own job and is the part that used to be missing: the pass counted
//! what it had attempted and never asked the game what was still there afterwards.
//!
//! # The complaint this answers
//!
//! Reported 2026-09-10, twice: "loading a build from URL doesn't appear to send the previous
//! inventory back into storage -- at least not the weapons, or armor, talismans". It did not, and
//! that was a decision rather than an oversight: [`crate::reorder`] makes the build's items sort
//! above everything else, so nothing gets in the way of the order, and evicting a player's
//! belongings to tidy a list is a larger change to the character than the import itself.
//!
//! That reasoning holds for crafting materials and consumables. It does not hold for the three
//! categories the report names. A build is a statement about what the character wears and carries
//! to fight with, and a hundred armaments the build never mentions are not context -- they are the
//! previous build, still in the pockets.
//!
//! # What is never touched, and why that is a property rather than a list
//!
//! [`Category::is_gear`] answers it from the item id's top nibble, so every consumable, crafting
//! material, key item, spell and remembrance is outside this pass by construction. The engine's
//! own empty-slot rows -- the Unarmed fist in a bare hand, the empty-piece row in a bare armour
//! slot -- are outside it by [`er_build_import_core::sweep::is_engine_placeholder`], which is a
//! statement about what those ids mean rather than a list this module maintains. Both live in the
//! core crate, where the property
//! test can hold the classification to being total.
//!
//! # When the box is full, a surplus copy goes on the ground
//!
//! The storage box is not the only place an item can go, and for a long time this pass acted as
//! though it were. `CS::MapItemManImpl::DropItem` puts the item in the world where the character
//! is standing, and the engine's own filler builds the request from the gaitem instance -- so the
//! armament arrives carrying the upgrade level it was carried at and the Ash of War still mounted
//! on it. The ground has no capacity, so a full box stops being a reason for anything to stay.
//!
//! That rung is preferred over destroying the item and is reported separately from it, because
//! one costs the player a walk and the other costs them the item. They must never be added
//! together in a report.
//!
//! # When neither will take it
//!
//! An armament does not always have somewhere else to go. Measured 2026-09-10 and again
//! 2026-09-11: the storage box was at `1920 of 1920` entries, so the box refused gear for no
//! reason to do with the gear at all.
//!
//! So, by user directive: when neither the box nor the ground will take an entry **and** the
//! character would still own [`REDUNDANT_COPIES`] or more of the same item without it, the
//! carried copy is destroyed instead.
//!
//! The threshold stays at two even though the directive that authorised this widened it, and the
//! reason is what the player actually agreed to. They agreed to items going on the ground. With
//! the drop available that is what happens and the threshold never comes up; with the drop
//! unavailable, destroying the only copy of a `+25` weapon is a materially different act from the
//! one they approved, so it is not done silently in its place. Raising this number is a decision
//! for the player, not a tidy-up for whoever reads this next. That count is measured rather than accumulated -- see [`retained_after`] -- because
//! three separate live failures were all the same failure: a running total of the character's
//! holdings that the loop keeping it was itself mutating.
//!
//! The Ash of War comes off first, through the engine's own remove action
//! ([`er_game_base::rva::REMOVE_GEM_FROM_WEAPON_RVA`]), because an ash is an item consumed into
//! one specific instance and destroying the weapon with it mounted destroys the ash too.
//!
//! A refusal the box makes about the *item* -- it will not take that kind at all -- leaves it
//! exactly where it was, and so does an entry still on the character.
//!
//! # The trap that would have deposited the build's own weapons
//!
//! An armament's upgrade level lives in the last two digits of its item id, so the id the plan
//! names (+0) and the id the character carries (+25) are different numbers. An allowance built
//! from the plan alone therefore does not recognise the very armaments the grant just minted. It
//! is built from both: the planned ids and the `GaItemHandle`s the grant reports actually landing,
//! which is what [`GrantOutcome::armaments`] carries and what
//! [`er_build_import_core::sweep::Kept::Pinned`] is named for.
//!
//! [`GrantOutcome::armaments`]: crate::grant::GrantOutcome::armaments
