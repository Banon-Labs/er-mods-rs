//! Turning the LIVE character into an `er-build-planner` share link.
//!
//! The mirror image of [`crate::request`]/[`crate::tick`], and deliberately the same SHAPE: a press
//! latches a request, the game-thread step does the part that must touch game memory, and a worker
//! does the part that must not run on the game thread. What differs is which half is slow.
//!
//! * The IMPORTER's slow half is at the FRONT -- a blocking HTTPS GET -- so its worker runs first
//!   and its game-thread step applies the result.
//! * The EXPORTER has no network at all. The `?i=` share format carries the whole build in the URL
//!   (LZUTF8 over base64 over JSON), so nothing is fetched and no account is minted on someone
//!   else's free hobby service. Its slow half is at the BACK: `ShellExecuteW` spawns
//!   `winebrowser`, which spawns `xdg-open`, which spawns a browser. So the game-thread step runs
//!   FIRST -- reading the character is a few dozen native getter calls, microseconds -- and the
//!   worker takes the finished document away to encode, copy and open.
//!
//! # The in-flight latch must lose to the player
//!
//! A press while an export is running has to be refused, or two workers race for the clipboard. But
//! a latch that can only say "busy" is a latch that can strand the row: the link field next door
//! went dead for three consecutive presses because an active-flag survived a rebuilt dialog with
//! nothing left alive to clear it.
//!
//! So [`export_latch_is_stale`] answers from LIVE EVIDENCE, never from a flag alone:
//!
//! * [`Phase::Reading`] is claimed by the game-thread step, which runs every frame. A request that
//!   is still `Reading` after the step has run [`STALE_TICKS`] times was not picked up and never
//!   will be -- the tick's own counter is the witness, not a clock.
//! * [`Phase::Opening`] belongs to a worker thread that increments [`WORKERS_ALIVE`] on entry and
//!   decrements it from a `Drop` guard, so a panicking worker still releases it. `Opening` with no
//!   worker alive is a phase nobody owns.
//!
//! When it cannot prove the export is live, the press WINS and the latch is cleared. The worst case
//! of being wrong that way is two browser tabs; the worst case of the other way is a row that never
//! works again until the game restarts.
