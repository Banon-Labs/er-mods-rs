//! Import an Elden Ring build from an `er-build-planner` share link, into the character that is
//! already in the world.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! Two threads, split by what they are allowed to touch:
//!
//! * a **fetch worker** does the blocking HTTPS get and parses the payload. It touches no game
//!   state at all, which is why it may block.
//! * a **game-thread step**, [`tick`], does everything else. Building the catalog reads the param
//!   tables and the message repository; granting mutates the inventory and the `CSGaitemImp`
//!   singleton; stats, spells and equipment all call native functions. All of that belongs on the
//!   thread the game runs its own tasks on.
//!
//! Neither sleeps. The worker blocks in WinHTTP; [`tick`] re-checks its preconditions once a frame
//! and does nothing until they hold, which is the natural shape here and also what
//! `scripts/check-no-timeouts.py` requires.
//!
//! # Why this is a library and not just the DLL
//!
//! There are two callers with the same needs and different triggers:
//!
//! * `er-build-import` -- a standalone ME3 shell that imports the build named in
//!   `er-quickload.toml` once, as soon as a character is in the world.
//! * `er-quickload` -- the product DLL, whose System>Quit **Load Build from URL** row imports on
//!   demand, as many times as the player asks.
//!
//! The second is why [`request`] exists at all: the original code ran exactly once per process,
//! latched by an `AtomicBool`. That latch is now a phase machine ([`Phase`]) whose terminal states
//! -- [`Phase::Done`] and [`Phase::Failed`] -- are ones [`request`] accepts, so a second import is
//! an ordinary state transition rather than a special case. Nothing resets the machine on a timer:
//! it stays on its last outcome until someone asks for another build.

/// destroy the report anyone is still asking about. Measured on run `br-20260911-005533-858a`: the
/// investigation had to read the game-directory copy, which had survived only because nothing had
/// rotated it yet.

/// somewhere other than the run whose log explains it.
