//! Handing the build's items to the player, through the game's own inventory call.
//!
//! # Why not the community `ItemGib` table
//!
//! The Cheat Engine workflow this replaces writes a 16-byte record array and calls a routine
//! found by signature scan. The game already exports the operation:
//! `CS::EquipGameData::AddInventoryEquipByItemId` is what the engine itself uses, it resolves
//! the gaitem handle through `CSGaitemImp`, and it takes the same category-tagged item id the
//! catalog produces. Calling it means the engine owns the mutation, not us.
//!
//! # Why an armament does not go through that call
//!
//! Because two thirds of an armament are not in its item id, and that call has nowhere to put
//! them:
//!
//! * `AddInventoryEquipByItemId` -> `GetGaitemHandleByItemId` mints a BARE weapon gaitem. There
//!   is no gem in it, so the weapon carries whatever skill its `EquipParamWeapon` row names --
//!   for an infused row, usually none at all.
//! * `AddInventoryEquip` -> `EquipInventoryData::InsertItem(..., reinforcement = 0)` passes a
//!   hard-coded zero, and `InsertItem` writes it straight onto the instance through
//!   `GaitemLookupResult::SetReinforcement`. Every weapon it inserts is +0 until something puts
//!   the level back.
//!
//! The level is put back in BOTH places the engine keeps it: folded into the minted item id
//! (`er_build_import_core::plan::armament_item_id`, the half the player actually sees) and written to
//! the instance field afterwards, since `InsertItem` has just zeroed that one.
//!
//! So an armament is minted the way the engine mints one that drops out of the world already
//! carrying an ash -- `EquipParamCustomWeapon` goes through
//! `CSGaitemImp::GetGaItemHandleWeaponWithGem(csGaitem, &handle, weaponId, gemId)` -- and its
//! reinforcement is written onto the instance afterwards through the same virtual the engine's
//! own `InsertItem` uses. That is why [`Grant::weapon_skill`] and [`Grant::reinforce_lv`] finally
//! have somewhere to go; before this they were computed, logged as resolved, and dropped.
//!
//! # Why this runs on the game thread
//!
//! It mutates the player's inventory and touches the `CSGaitemImp` singleton. Doing that from
//! the fetch worker would race the game's own inventory code. The caller must invoke
//! [`grant_all`] from a `CSTaskImp` task.
//!
//! # Why every grant is read back
//!
//! `AddInventoryEquipByItemId` returns an int this code does not pretend to understand, and a
//! call that "succeeded" is not evidence the item exists. Each grant is confirmed with
//! `EquipInventoryData::GetQuantityByItemId`, so the log reports what the inventory actually
//! holds rather than how many calls were made. Armaments get a second read-back, because
//! quantity cannot see an ash: the minted instance is asked for its own arts id and reinforcement
//! through `GetSwordArtsParamForWeapon` / `GaitemLookupResult::GetReinforcement`.
