//! Reading the LIVE character back out of the game -- the exact inverse of the importer.
//!
//! # Why this is the easy direction
//!
//! The importer's hard problem is name -> id: the planner payload identifies every item by display
//! name, the game answers only id -> name, so [`crate::catalog`] enumerates several thousand rows
//! and inverts the result. Nothing here needs that. Every read below produces an ID, and turning an
//! id into a name is one call to the game's own getter ([`crate::catalog::name_for`]).
//!
//! # What is read, and what is deliberately NOT
//!
//! The scope is the LOADOUT: what the character is wearing, holding, has memorised, and is levelled
//! to. Not the whole inventory. That is a product decision with two independent justifications --
//! "my build" means the loadout rather than the six hundred crafting materials in the pouch, and the
//! share link carries its payload in the URL, so every item is bytes a browser has to swallow.
//!
//! # Every value here is a READ-BACK, never an assumption
//!
//! The equipment slots are read through `CS::EquipGameData::GetParamIdInSlot`, which is the same
//! oracle the importer verifies its own writes with -- and for the same reason recorded in
//! `equip_native`: the engine's equip call returns void and declines silently, so only the slot's
//! contents are evidence. An id that resolves to no name is DROPPED rather than guessed at, which
//! makes a garbage read produce a smaller build rather than a wrong one.
