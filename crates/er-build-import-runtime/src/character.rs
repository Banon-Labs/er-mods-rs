/// alongside the new one. Reported by the user 2026-08-30, and invisible until this session
/// because the spell natives were unmapped on 1.17 and the whole pass was inert.

/// # Why the clear runs over all fourteen entries and always from slot 0
///
/// `EquipMagicInSlot` ends by calling `ValidateEquipMagicData` (`0x140251010`), which
/// LEFT-COMPACTS the array: it walks `0..14` and, for every empty entry, pulls the first
/// non-empty entry after it forward and empties the source. Two consequences, and both of them
/// break the obvious implementation:
///
/// * a clear bounded by the character's CAPACITY is worse than no clear at all. Emptying
///   `0..capacity` makes the compaction drag whatever sits in `capacity..14` -- spells from
///   before a respec dropped the character's Memory Stone count -- forward into exactly the
///   slots the build is about to fill;
/// * slot indices do not survive a clear, so a sweep of `0..14` in order does not empty the
///   array. Every non-empty entry is a prefix of it after any write, which is what makes
///   clearing SLOT 0, repeatedly, correct: each call removes exactly one entry and the engine
///   re-packs the rest. Fourteen iterations therefore drain fourteen entries, and every one of
///   them touches only slot 0, which is inside the array by construction.
///
/// The fill afterwards is unaffected: writing `0, 1, 2, ...` into an empty array leaves no hole
/// for the compaction to close, so no spell moves after it is placed.
///
/// # The one case it declines to clear
///
/// `spells` empty means either "this build memorises nothing" or "this payload has no `spells`
/// key", and [`er_build_import_core::model::BuildDoc`] cannot tell them apart -- the field is
/// `#[serde(default)]`. It also covers "every spell the build named failed to resolve against
