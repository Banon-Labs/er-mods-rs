//! Building the item catalog from the running game.
//!
//! The planner payload names items and gives no ids, so importing a build needs a
//! name -> id map. The obvious source is the planner's own bundled database, but the
//! game already holds the same table -- in the player's language, at the player's patch
//! level, DLC included -- so this asks the game instead of shipping a copy of someone
//! else's dataset.
//!
//! # Two halves, both borrowed rather than invented
//!
//! *Rows* come from [`SoloParamRepository::rows`](eldenring::cs::SoloParamRepository::rows), which
//! yields `(row_id, &row)` for a param table. *Names* come from the game's own per-category
//! getters, each a one-call wrapper around `MsgRepositoryImp::LookupEntry` that walks its own
//! bundle chain.
//!
//! Calling those wrappers rather than reimplementing the chain is not fastidiousness.
//! `GetGoodsName` consults **four** bundles (`0x6f`, `0xa`, `0x13f`, `0x1a3`), while the
//! neighbouring categories look like a tidy base/dlc01 pair -- an importer that inferred
//! the pattern from its neighbours would silently lose two whole bundles of consumables.
//!
//! # The map runs the wrong way, on purpose
//!
//! The game answers *id -> name*; the importer needs *name -> id*. So the table is built
//! by enumerating every row, asking for its name, and inverting. That is a few thousand
//! calls once, not per lookup.
