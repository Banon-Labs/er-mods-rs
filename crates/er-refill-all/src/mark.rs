//! Marking every eligible item refill / no-refill, and deciding which way a press goes.
//!
//! # Why this does not call the function the storage box calls
//!
//! `SetItemReplenishState` (1.16.2 `0x140786430`) is what the storage-box UI invokes, and it is a
//! TOGGLE, not a setter:
//!
//! ```c
//! bVar2 = ShouldReplenishItem(tracker, itemId);
//! SetState(tracker, itemId, !bVar2);        // flips whatever was there
//! ```
//!
//! Looping that over every item SCATTERS the states -- each item lands on the opposite of whatever
//! it happened to be -- which is not "mark everything" and looks, from the player's side, exactly
//! like the feature half-working. It also `DLPanic`s when `GLOBAL_CSMenuMan` is null.
//!
//! One level down, `CS::ItemReplenishStateTracker::SetState` (`0x14023dd80`) is the absolute
//! setter. It is idempotent, and it SELF-FILTERS: its first act is `GetEquipParamReplenishType`
//! with an early return on `None`, so passing an ineligible id is a safe no-op and this module
//! needs no eligibility table of its own. It also skips the `CSMenuMan` check, which is why the
//! null checks below are ours to do.
//!
//! # The ceiling that makes this dangerous
//!
//! The tracker is a `DLFixedVector` of 2048 entries. BOTH insertion paths -- `InsertSorted`
//! (`0x14023df20`) and the append path (`0x14023e270`) -- carry the same guard:
//!
//! ```c
//! if (0x800 < param_1->count + 1U) { DLPanic(..., "out of memory.", ...); }  // does not return
//! ```
//!
//! `DLPanic` does not return: overflowing this vector crashes the game outright. An offline census
//! of the stock 1.16.2 regulation (`scripts/regulation-autoreplenish-census.py`) counts 449
//! eligible rows against that 2048, so the feature fits with room to spare -- but "fits on the
//! stock regulation" is not "cannot overflow". A modded regulation can add rows, and a weapon id
//! carries its reinforcement level, so the set of ids that can legally reach the tracker is not
//! bounded by the row count alone. [`INSERT_CEILING`] is the belt: this module stops inserting and
//! says so in the log rather than letting the game die.

// Every item below is consumed by `runtime`, which is windows-only, plus the tests. Scoped
// to this module and to `dead_code` alone -- NOT a crate-level blanket that would also
// swallow `unused_imports` and hide a real lint (bd
// host-build-cfg-gate-allow-pattern-hides-real-lints).
