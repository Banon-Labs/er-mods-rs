//! The windows-only half: the gate hook, the pad/keyboard read, and the native writes.
//!
//! # The gate is structural, not a check
//!
//! The requirement is that the hotkey "can only have an effect when the user is in the menu view
//! that would have any refillable item options". That menu is the storage box, and its dialog is
//! `CS::DepositoryDialog`. This DLL brackets that dialog's LIFETIME -- latching on its constructor
//! and clearing on its destructor -- and acts only while the latch is open. The dialog is genuinely
//! heap-owned rather than pooled (its scalar-deleting destructor calls `operator_delete(this,
//! 0x3190)`), so construction and destruction really are "opened" and "closed".
//!
//! # Why NOT the shared `MenuWindow::Update`
//!
//! The first version hooked `FUN_140745570` -- the `MenuWindow` update every dialog inherits -- and
//! identified the storage box by comparing `*this` against its vtable. That worked live, but it was
//! the wrong prologue to own, for two independent reasons:
//!
//! 1. **It is shared with every other menu window in the game, and MinHook binds ONE detour per
//!    address.** The second `MH_CreateHook` on an address gets `MH_ERROR_ALREADY_CREATED`; the
//!    loser reports installed, never runs, and logs nothing. `er-hook`'s own header records that as
//!    measured, not hypothetical: the product and `er-armament-icons` both detoured the Scaleform
//!    `file_open` prologue and the product ran an entire session with `installed = true` and
//!    `hits = 0`. A generic prologue is the most likely address in the game to be contended.
//! 2. **The hook union cannot carry it.** The union's shared signature is
//!    `extern "system" fn(usize, usize, usize, usize) -> usize`, but `MenuWindow::Update` is
//!    `(this, f32 delta, InputData*)` -- `delta` travels in **XMM1**, with RDX unused. The union
//!    never names XMM1, so routing that prologue through a Rust dispatcher would leave the frame
//!    delta riding in a volatile register the ABI does not model, for EVERY menu in the game. The
//!    corruption that risks is worse than the collision it would prevent.
//!
//! So this hooks two `DepositoryDialog`-SPECIFIC prologues instead, both of which take integer
//! arguments only and therefore fit the union's ABI exactly:
//!
//! | | address | signature | uniqueness |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | constructor | `0x1408d54a0` | `(this, SceneObjProxy*, u8) -> this` | one call site, the factory |
//! | scalar-deleting destructor | `0x1408d6430` | `(this, u64 flags) -> this` | vtable slot 1, this class only |
//!
//! Both are registered through [`er_hook::register_shared_hook`], which chains into
//! `er_quickload.dll`'s single union when the product is co-loaded and uses this DLL's own union
//! when it is not -- so no handler can ever be silently dropped, here or in another mod.
//!
//! Per-frame work does not need a hook at all: it runs from a `CSTaskImp` `FrameBegin` task, the
//! same way `er-enemynpc-effects` drives its sweep. That is also the thread `GetAsyncKeyState`
//! actually reports the user's keys on under Wine/Proton.
