//! Mark every refillable item refill / no-refill, on one controller or keyboard combination,
//! and only inside the storage box.
//!
//! Elden Ring's storage box lets you flag items to be topped back up from storage at a site of
//! grace, one item at a time. With a few hundred flagged items that is a few hundred presses. This
//! DLL does the whole set at once, and cycles: press once for "everything refills", press again
//! for "nothing refills".
//!
//! Three things are worth knowing before reading further, each of which is a way this could look
//! like it works and not:
//!
//! * **The obvious native function is a toggle, not a setter.** Looping it would scatter the
//!   states rather than set them. See [`mark`].
//! * **The state vector is fixed at 2048 entries and overflowing it crashes the game.** See
//!   [`mark::INSERT_CEILING`].
//! * **The storage-box restriction is structural.** This code runs from inside the storage box
//!   dialog's own update, so "not in the storage box" means "never called". See [`runtime`].
//!
//! Item eligibility, stack limits, destination capacity and the storage -> inventory transfer are
//! all delegated to the game's own 1.16.2 code rather than reimplemented.

// Ungated on purpose: pure text/bit parsing, so their tests run on the host.
