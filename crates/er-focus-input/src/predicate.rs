//! The focus predicate, and the one byte that turns it off.
//!
//! # The chain, decoded 2026-09-05 from the 1.16.2 Ghidra dump (`:8765`) and byte-checked in both
//! # `eldenring-deobf.bin` and `eldenring-deobf-1.17.bin`
//!
//! 1. `CS::CSPadStep::STEP_Update` (1.16.2 `0x140e33aa0`, called from `FUN_1400b3f40`) opens its
//!    input update with
//!
//!    ```text
//!    bVar2 = CS::CSWindowImp::IsGameInForeground(GLOBAL_CSWindow);   // 0x140e342ff
//!    if (bVar2) { if (JustGainedFocus(GLOBAL_CSWindow)) goto CHECK_DEBUG_FLAG; }
//!    else       { CHECK_DEBUG_FLAG: if (*(char *)(this + 0xba) == 0) { bVar2 = false; goto DONE; } }
//!    bVar2 = true;
//!    ```
//!
//!    `IsGameInForeground` (`0x14266df00`) is four instructions: `GetForegroundWindow()` compared
//!    against `CSWindowImp+0x8`. So `bVar2` is "run the normal input update", and the only way an
//!    unfocused frame reaches it is through `CSPadStep+0xba`.
//!
//! 2. `CSPadStep+0xba` is not state. `STEP_Update` REWRITES it at its own tail, every frame:
//!
//!    ```text
//!    0x140e344dc  call Game.Debug.IsEnableControlOnDisactiveWindow
//!    0x140e344e1  mov  byte ptr [rdi + 0xba], al
//!    ```
//!
//!    and `CS::CSPadStep::CSPadStep` (`0x140e328d0`) seeds it from the same call at `+0x7e`.
//!
//! 3. `Game.Debug.IsEnableControlOnDisactiveWindow` is a three-instruction FromSoft debug-property
//!    stub. Its whole body (1.16.2 `0x1402e6853`, reached through the thunk `0x140e53220`):
//!
//!    ```text
//!    movzx eax, byte ptr [0x144588af1]     ; 0f b6 05 97 22 2a 04
//!    lea   rsp, [rsp + 8]
//!    jmp   qword ptr [rsp - 8]
//!    ```
//!
//!    Ghidra reports exactly one reader of `0x144588af1` (that instruction) and exactly two callers
//!    of the getter (`STEP_Update` and the `CSPadStep` constructor). The byte ships as `0x00` in
//!    both images. There is no other consumer to disturb.
//!
//! 4. What the unfocused branch costs, which is why the symptom looked like "the write did not
//!    take". With `bVar2 == false`, `STEP_Update` runs
//!
//!    ```text
//!    GLOBAL_FD4PadManager->field624_0x2f8 = true;
//!    FD4::FD4PadManager::Update(GLOBAL_FD4PadManager, time);   // 0x142667c70
//!    ```
//!
//!    and skips `CSMouseMan::Update` entirely. `FD4PadManager::Update` latches that byte forward
//!    into `+0x2f9`, and every `CSInGamePad` query short-circuits on it -- `FUN_142664380`,
//!    `FUN_142664280`, `FUN_1426640f0`, all reached from `PollInput` (`0x142665060`), each opening
//!    with `if (GLOBAL_FD4PadManager->field625_0x2f9 == false) { ...read the pad... }`. So a probe
//!    that writes a stick into the live `FD4PadDevice` writes into a device nothing will read.
//!
//! # The 1.17 address
//!
//! `docs/recon/rva-map-1162-to-1170.functions.tsv` already carries both callers
//! (`0xe33aa0 -> 0xe358a0`, `0xe328d0 -> 0xe346d0`). Decoding those two 1.17 functions
//! (`scripts/find-debug-flag-getter.py`) finds the getter call at the identical byte offsets --
//! `+0xa3c` and `+0x7e` -- both reaching one stub at `0x140e55020`, which reads `0x14458cb71`.
//! That is `0x4588af1 + 0x4080`, and `+0x4080` is the delta every already-mapped `.data` neighbour
//! moved by (`0x4588e98`, `0x4589390`, `0x45896a8`, `0x4589ad8`, `0x4589bdc`).
//! `scripts/map-data-rvas-1162-to-1170.py 0x4588af1 --confirm 0x458cb71` agrees, and the pair is
//! recorded in that script's `SHAPE_RESCUED` table so the generated map carries it.
//!
//! # What was eliminated
//!
//! * **Patching `IsGameInForeground` itself** -- a user directive already forbids it (2026-07-16,
//!   `crates/er-title-flow/src/constants_autoload_state.rs`), and the reason is visible right here:
//!   `CSMouseMan::Update` (`0x140e1e500`) calls `FUN_140e1eac0` (`ClipCursor` / `SetCursorPos`) and
//!   `FUN_140e1ecb0` (`ShowCursor`), each gated by `FUN_140e1e620`, which itself calls
//!   `IsGameInForeground`. Forcing the predicate true confines the OS cursor to an unfocused
//!   window. Forcing the debug byte does not: the cursor gate keeps reading the real answer.
//! * **DirectInput cooperative level** -- `DLUID::KeyboardDevice::SetupDirectInput`
//!   (`0x141f6d6c0`) selects `0xA` (`DISCL_NONEXCLUSIVE | DISCL_BACKGROUND`) and only switches to
//!   `0x6` (`| DISCL_FOREGROUND`) when
//!   `DLUserInputManagerImpl+0x88f` (`Ext.UserInput.CooperativeLevel.SetForeGround.Keyboard`) is
//!   set. That field comes from `GetPropertyBoolean(props, name, false)` -- a debug system
//!   property, default false -- so the shipped device is acquired background and keeps delivering
//!   while unfocused. Not the gate.
//! * **The DLUID `+0x88d` "input active" latch** that `er-input-harness` re-asserts every frame.
//!   Its only consumer is guarded by the same default-false `Ext.*.SetForeGround.*` flags --
//!   `FUN_141f6bad0` reads it solely inside
//!   `if (Ext_UserInput_CooperativeLevel_SetForeGround_Pad != false) { ... }` -- so on a stock
//!   build that write is inert. It is not harmful and is not this shell's business, but it is not
//!   what unblocks unfocused input either.
