//! er-focus-input -- ELDEN RING accepts input while its window is UNFOCUSED.
//!
//! A standalone `er_focus_input.dll`, loaded as its own `[[natives]]` entry. Its mere presence
//! enables it: no env var, no marker file, no config. Omit it from the profile to get vanilla
//! focus behaviour back.
//!
//! # What it is for
//!
//! Agent-driven runtime validation cannot require the game to hold OS focus -- the user needs
//! their focus elsewhere, and a run that silently depends on it produces evidence for a state
//! nobody arranged. Measured 2026-09-05 (run `br-20260905-031000-5ac5`): the product's move probe
//! wrote the forward stick into the live `FD4PadDevice` for 150 frames
//! (`oracle_supplied_movement_input_frames = 150`), the character moved on 5
//! (`oracle_did_move_frames = 5`), `oracle_can_move` stayed false, and the ER window was mapped and
//! visible but not focused. `crates/er-focus-input/src/predicate.rs` decodes why, instruction by
//! instruction, and this shell forces the one byte that ends it.
//!
//! # Mechanism, in one line
//!
//! `CS::CSPadStep::STEP_Update` skips the whole input update on an unfocused frame unless
//! `Game.Debug.IsEnableControlOnDisactiveWindow()` is true. That accessor is a single
//! `movzx eax, byte ptr [<global>]`, and this shell writes that global from the game thread each
//! frame. Read `predicate.rs` before changing anything here -- it carries the addresses, the two
//! independent 1.17 corroborations, and the three candidate mechanisms that were eliminated.
//!
//! # Why it installs no detour
//!
//! The intervention is a byte store into a `.data` global. There is no prologue to detour, so
//! there is nothing for a second MinHook instance to overwrite and nothing for `er-hook`'s union
//! to arbitrate -- which is what makes this shell co-loadable with the product and with every
//! other shell in the workspace unconditionally. See `scripts/me3-dll-conflicts.toml`.

// A cdylib whose only consumers are `DllMain` and the `#[cfg(windows)]` game task it registers. On
// a host build those callers are cfg'd out, so `dead_code` there reports the cfg rather than real
// debt; the shipping target carries the full workspace deny. Same shape as er-input-harness.
