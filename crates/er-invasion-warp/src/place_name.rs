//! Turn a block's `PlaceName` id into the words the game itself uses for that area.
//!
//! # Why the banner said `m60_50_39_00`
//!
//! The filter judges by block, and a block id is what it had to hand. It is also unreadable: a
//! player who is told they were rejected from `m60_50_39_00` has to go and look that up, which is
//! the opposite of what a two-second auto-closing banner is for. The map pins have carried real
//! names all along -- they are named from the nearest shipped warp row -- so the name exists, it
//! simply was not being asked for.
//!
//! # The lookup, and why it needs no `MenuString`
//!
//! `CS::MsgRepository::GetAndFormat` (`0x1407633d0`) resolves a `PlaceName` in two steps: it reads
//! the `MsgRepositoryImp` singleton out of [`MSG_REPOSITORY_GLOBAL_RVA`], calls a getter with
//! `(repo, id)` to obtain a raw `wchar_t*`, and only THEN wraps that pointer in a `MenuString`.
//! The wrapper `0x1407611c0` is what binds the getter to `PlaceName`:
//!
//! ```text
//!   getter = FUN_140d10b60;
//!   CS::MsgRepository::GetAndFormat(out, &getter, id, L"PlaceName", L"PN");
//! ```
//!
//! Only the first step is wanted here, so [`PLACE_NAME_LOOKUP_RVA`] is called directly. That
//! matters for more than tidiness: constructing a `MenuString` means handing the engine a zeroed
//! `DLString` to assign into, and a zeroed `DLString` has a null allocator -- which is exactly the
//! failure that made the rejection banner render empty. Taking the pointer avoids re-entering that
//! trap rather than hoping it behaves differently here.
//!
//! The getter tries the base `PlaceName` FMG, then `PlaceName_dlc01`, then `PlaceName_dlc02`, and
//! returns the literal `?PlaceName?` when all three miss. That sentinel is treated as "no name"
//! rather than passed through, because putting `?PlaceName?` on a banner is worse than the block id
//! it replaced.
