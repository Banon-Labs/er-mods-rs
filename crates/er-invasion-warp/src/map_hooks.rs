//! The world-map detours.
//!
//! # The injection, and why it is gated the way it is
//!
//! The seam is the `CS::WorldMapViewModel` constructor: the pin-row list at `+0x2d8` is populated
//! there and nowhere else. Appending anywhere else is unsafe -- `CS::WorldMapWarpData+0x08` holds
//! RAW pointers into this buffer, and the reserve relocates it, so a later append dangles every
//! live dialog row pointer. At the ctor epilogue no dialog exists yet.
//!
//! **The ViewModel is NOT built once per session.** The RE said it was, and a first run appeared
//! to confirm it (`ctor #1`). A later run measured `ctor #1 this=0x2d41be80` followed by
//! `ctor #2 this=0x8400a580` -- a second, different instance, with its own freshly-built
//! 420-row list, and that second one got nothing. That single log is both reported symptoms at
//! once: the markers vanish when the map is reopened, and views other than the first are bare.
//!
//! So injection runs on EVERY constructor call and remembers nothing between them. The ctor
//! builds a fresh list each time, which makes re-injection the correct behaviour rather than a
//! hazard, and makes bookkeeping the only thing that can be wrong -- as it twice was, first as a
//! process-wide flag and then as a `this`-pointer table that a recycled menu-heap address
//! defeats. What IS shared is the catalog-derived registry and the synthetic param rows, built
//! once: a pin does not own its param row, and rebuilding them per open would both leak and drag
//! a 7073-point catalog walk into the frame where the player opens the map.
//!
//! The observation that shipped first measured the list before anything was written: rows=420,
//! capacity=474, **54 spare**, vftable `0x142ad82a8`, and `356160 / 0x350` dividing exactly. That
//! is why the append reserves rather than assuming room.
//!
//! Every step is fail-closed, because the failure modes here are not soft:
//!
//! * allocation failure inside the reserve is a **hard `DLPanic`**, not a null return, and both
//!   buffers are alive during it -- so the pin set is capped per-block (365, ~310 KB) rather
//!   than per-point (7073, ~5.8 MB);
//! * the reserve happens **once** with the final count; per-row reserves copy-construct every
//!   existing element each time;
//! * rows are built by the engine's own ctor and placed with the engine's own copy-ctor -- never
//!   `memcpy`, which would double-free the row's two owned heap regions at teardown;
//! * the temp row is destroyed with the engine's dtor, never `free`;
//! * `end` is re-read every iteration and written back, exactly as the ctor's own append does.
//!
//! If any check fails the append is skipped and the reason is logged. A map without invasion
//! pins is a disappointment; a corrupted MenuHeap is a crash.
//!
//! # Hooking rules this module obeys
//!
//! * Every detour goes through the `er_hook` UNION, never a bare `MhHook`. Two MinHook instances
//!   patching one prologue corrupt each other's trampolines, and `er_effects_rs.dll` may be
//!   loaded alongside this DLL.
//! * Nothing is patched until [`crate::map_seams::verify_seam`] has re-read the live prologue.
//! * A handler that finds no trampoline does NOT invent a return value -- see
//!   [`worldmap_viewmodel_ctor_hook`].
//!
//! # Open hazard
//!
//! The RE contract says to enter the ctor trampoline by JMP, never CALL: the prologue is
//! `mov rax, rsp` and later frame references derive from it, so a pushed return address shifts
//! the frame. This handler CALLs the trampoline and it worked live (the ctor ran, the list read
//! back coherent, the world loaded) -- most likely because the ctor takes <= 4 register args and
//! builds its own frame with `sub rsp, 0x170`, leaving a shifted-but-self-consistent anchor. One
//! success is not proof. If a fifth stack argument or a caller-frame-relative read is ever found
//! in this ctor, the CALL form breaks and this must become a JMP-entry trampoline.

// * a process-wide flag left every map view after the first with no pins;

// Injection is idempotent-by-construction instead: the ctor builds a FRESH row list every time
