//! Find Seamless's session by what changes when the player invades, not by what it looks like.
//!
//! # Why a shape scan cannot answer this
//!
//! Every previous attempt asked "does this object look like a session" -- a state field holding one
//! of four codes, an `_Mtx_internal_imp_t` at `+0x100`, a plausible pointer. Measured
//! 2026-09-08 by [`super::session_scan::scan_address_space_for_active_session`], 671 MB of the
//! running game holds **25,192** objects that answer yes. The signature is four small integers at
//! known offsets, and a process this size contains that pattern by accident tens of thousands of
//! times.
//!
//! The five candidates latched and then disproved live say the same thing in a smaller number, and
//! they say something else as well: `0x55080038`, `0xa4450038`, `0x1f0a0038`, `0xa2760038`,
//! `0xd2c0038` all end in the same sixteen bits. That is one repeating heap structure being found
//! over and over, not five coincidences.
//!
//! # The property no impostor can fake
//!
//! `ersc+0x25850`, the invade action, opens `cmp dword [rdi + 0x150], 1` / `jne <return>` and then
//! writes `0xe` into that same field. So the real session is idle before the player invades and
//! active immediately after, and that transition is caused by the player rather than merely
//! observed. An object that reads `0x01` forever satisfies every static check and fails this one.
//!
//! This module therefore records the addresses that read idle while nothing is happening, and when
//! a join is in flight it re-reads exactly those addresses and keeps only the ones that moved. The
//! survivors intersect across invasions, so each attempt narrows the set further rather than
//! starting over.
//!
//! Reads only. Nothing is written into the game, no thread is suspended, and the walk runs on the
//! sweeper's worker thread for the reason recorded in [`super::session_scan`]: a full pass is
//! hundreds of thousands of `ReadProcessMemory` round trips under Wine, which froze the frame for
//! 3.5 seconds every 11 when it ran on the game thread.
