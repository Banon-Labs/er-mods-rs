//! ERSC entry points, session-object layout and state codes -- one [`Abi`] per Seamless Co-op
//! build, chosen at runtime by byte-checking the module that is actually loaded.
//!
//! # Why this is a table rather than four constants
//!
//! `ersc.dll` is third-party. The user installs it and updates it whenever they like, and the last
//! update moved every address this module pins and the fields those addresses operate on.
//! A single constant set can only ever be right about one build, and the build it is right about
//! changes without warning -- so the addresses live in an [`Abi`] record that
//! [`super::resolve_ersc_abi`] selects by fingerprint, refusing anything it cannot identify.
//!
//! **[`SUPPORTED`] holds exactly one entry, and that is a product decision: this mod drives the
//! latest Seamless Co-op only.** The table is not vestigial -- Seamless will update again, and the
//! next build replaces this entry, measured the way this one was. A build that is no longer the
//! latest leaves nothing behind: no second entry, no fingerprint, no pinned addresses. The
//! refusal does not need to name which stale build it found, only that it is not the supported
//! one.
//!
//! # How each address here was identified
//!
//! A byte match was not accepted as an identification for any of these. Every one is reproducible
//! with `scripts/ersc-disas.py` against the installed DLL, read in place.
//!
//! | | RVA | what identifies it |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `show` | `0x241a0` | unique masked-body match; `.pdata` index 301; function size `0xa0a` |
//! | invade action | `0x25850` | `.pdata` index 319, on a shift that holds unbroken over 78 consecutive functions; the only action of its shape writing `0xe`, at `0x25886`, out of 4903 functions |
//! | cancel action | `0x258d0` | unique masked-body match, and `.pdata` index 320 on that same shift, and size `0x64` |
//! | `BuildLobbyKey` | `0xad6e0` | `.pdata` index 1782, size `0x2d1`; loads the SHA-256 IV and a 32-byte `.rdata` salt `0x23` bytes apart; its two callers sit in one function that calls it twice `0xaf` apart; its opening decodes to `movzx edx,[rcx+CTX]; shr edx,2; and edx,1` |
//!
//! Two lessons from that measurement are worth keeping, because they are about method and will
//! apply again the next time Seamless ships:
//!
//! * **A masked body signature can miss a function that has not moved.** The compiler inverted the
//!   invade action's idle guard -- `cmp [rdi+STATE],IDLE; je <continue>` became
//!   `cmp [rdi+STATE],IDLE; jne <return>` -- and `je`/`jne` differ in the OPCODE byte, which a
//!   masked search keeps. One byte at offset 21 defeated every signature length on the ladder.
//! * **A unique prologue hit is a code shape, not a function.** `BuildLobbyKey`'s 19-byte prologue
//!   matched exactly one address and it was the wrong one: `0x1a6d0` merely happens to frame
//!   `0x148` too, and sits at `.pdata` index 193 -- 1589 entries from the real function.
//!   Big-frame MSVC functions in one source file look alike from the top; the resolution has to
//!   come from reading, not from picking.
//!
//! # The session ABI moves as one block
//!
//! The mutex sub-object, the guard and the state field keep their relative spacing
//! (`guard = mutex+0x4c`, `state = mutex+0x50`), so they move together. That is one finding with
//! three consequences rather than three separate measurements, and it is the shape to re-check
//! first when the fields move again.
//!
//! # The state enum renumbers wholesale, so leaving a code alone is the dangerous option
//!
//! Scanning every `mov dword [reg+STATE], imm32` in the real code finds seven distinct values.
//! When Seamless last shifted them, all seven moved by a uniform `+1` and a new state was inserted
//! at the bottom -- including the "idle" sentinel the guarded actions compare against. A state code
//! carried across a build unchanged is therefore not the conservative choice: it is how a progress
//! marker silently becomes a fast-fail state.
//!
// Every `*_PROLOGUE` below is assembled from named `iced-x86` instructions by this crate's
// `build.rs`, which additionally checks each one against a real copy of the build it claims to
// describe -- located by the Seamless version string inside the file rather than by which
// directory it sits in. Hand-typing them is what the generator exists to prevent: one wrong
// byte and every check here silently fails closed, which looks exactly like "Seamless is not
// loaded".
