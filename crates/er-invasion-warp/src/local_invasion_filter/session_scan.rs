//! Finding Seamless's session object without detouring anything inside `ersc.dll`.
//!
//! MinHook's five-byte patch into `ersc.dll` faults at `0x140010043` with no input given --
//! `show` (ersc+0x241a0) at ~50s and again at 29.5s on run `br-20260909-234803-535c`, the
//! lobby-key builder (ersc+0xad6e0) at 30.6s. That is a fact about writing bytes into a
//! Themida-protected module, not about observing one: Frida's `Interceptor` sits on that same
//! `ersc+0x241a0` for a whole session and hands over the menu object every time. So a detour-free
//! route is preferred here, not mandatory, and this module is one: a walk of `ersc.dll`'s own
//! writable sections, testing each qword against a signature strong enough to identify the
//! object.
//!
//! # Every narrowing here was bought by a live failure
//!
//! The signature started as "a small integer at `session+0x150`" and has been narrowed four times,
//! each time by a run it cost:
//!
//! | accepted | what it really was | what it cost |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | zeroed memory | a zeroed global | `state 0x00` forever, so the filter read an invasion as permanently in flight and refused every map warp for the run |
//! | `0x61`, `0x62`, `0x63` | a UTF-16 text buffer | the "session state" tracked the text as it changed |
//! | `0x3dfadb` | a 3-byte-misaligned window into a table of Wine pointers | four rejections, zero cancellations, `owner 0x0` for the run |
//! | `0x143c0cdc0` | `eldenring.exe+0x3c0cdc0`, the game's own `.data` | ersc+0x25871 locked a static global nothing unlocks; the main thread waited until the 30s stall watchdog fired |
//! | `0x860f90f8` | an allocation with no mutex at `+0x100` | one rejection judged, not cancelled, and the invasion proceeded |
//!
//! The last of those is why [`super::identifies_a_session`] now asks
//! [`super::lock_report::mutex_shape_identifies_a_session`]. The discriminator that caught it
//! already existed -- it just ran when an action was about to be driven, long after
//! [`cached_scan_for_session`] had latched the pointer and started revalidating it with the same
//! predicate that accepted it.
//!
//! It sits in its own file rather than in the parent because the parent is at the hard limit
//! `scripts/check-rust-file-sizes.py` enforces, which is the same reason `lock_report` moved.
//!
//! This reads only; it writes nothing into Seamless and patches no bytes.

///
/// * `+0x150` holds an active state. The invade action opens `cmp dword [rdi+0x150], 1` / `jne` --
///   it refuses to run unless idle -- and then writes `0xe` there. So from the start of a search
///   until it settles, that field cannot read `state_idle`.
/// * `+0x100` is an `_Mtx_internal_imp_t` carrying `_Mtx_try`, the bit MSVC's `std::mutex`
///   constructor writes.
/// * `_Count` at `+0x14c` is 0 or 1, because the lock is not recursive.
