//!
//! Seamless Co-op runs its own invasion system: none of `ersc.dll`'s 286 resolved signature
//! slots reach `CSBreakInPointManager` or `CS::QuickmatchManager`, so the world-map pins this
//! crate injects -- built from the `.aip` table and MSB `InvasionPoint` regions -- are a VANILLA
//! invasion surface and say nothing about where a Seamless invader lands. The code that picks
//! the target is inside the Themida-encrypted part of `ersc.dll` and cannot be read statically.
//!
//! It does not have to be read. The decision's OUTPUT is written to `CSGameMan` in the clear:
//! an MSB entry-point entity id at `+0xaf0` and a destination map at `+0xac8`, both consumed by
//! `FUN_140afcf60`, the spawn resolver `ersc.dll` hooks. One invasion therefore yields the fact
//! that the static analysis could not.

/// Sample the invasion destination and log it when it changes.
