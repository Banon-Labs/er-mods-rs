//! Installing the three world-map detours.
//!
//! Split out of `map_hooks` on 2026-08-30, when that file stood 29 lines under the 3200-line
//! FAIL threshold in `scripts/check-rust-file-sizes.py`. The seam is a real one: everything here
//! runs ONCE, from the game task thread, and decides only WHERE a hook goes and whether it may go
//! there. What the hooks then do every frame -- the ctor handler, the row filter, the injection --
//! stays in the parent, which is what those three actually have in common with each other.
//!
//! THE ONE INVARIANT THIS FILE EXISTS TO HOLD: the three installs are INDEPENDENT. They used to
//! be a chain, and a single refused seam silently disarmed two unrelated features -- including the
//! softlock fix. See [`install_map_observers`], which spells out why, and do not re-couple them
//! when moving code past this point.

    // THREE INDEPENDENT HOOKS, INSTALLED INDEPENDENTLY.
    //
    // This used to be a chain: the ViewModel ctor was hooked first and the other two were
    // installed only from its SUCCESS arm. So one refused seam disarmed two unrelated features
    // that had nothing to do with it, and did so silently -- the log carried the ctor's refusal
    // and not a word about the two installs that never happened.
    //
    // The ctor seam is not expected to refuse on 1.17 as things stand: its row is in the map
    // (0x8855b0 -> 0x8865a0) and its recorded 12-byte prologue was byte-checked against
    // `eldenring-deobf-1.17.bin` at the destination and MATCHES, as do the other two. That is
    // precisely why the coupling has to go now rather than after it bites: a chain that happens
    // to work is one map regeneration, one recompiled prologue or one MinHook error away from
    // taking the softlock fix down with it, and the failure would be silent.
    //
    // The confirm interceptor is the one that makes the chaining actively harmful. It is the
    // SOFTLOCK FIX: it swallows a confirm carrying an id in our private 0x7F000000 band, which
    // the engine cannot resolve and which hangs the loading screen if it reaches
    // `CallLua_Warp`. Its handler is gated on that id band alone, so with no pins injected it is
    // a pure no-op -- there is no state it needs from the ctor hook and no cost to arming it.
    // Losing it because a DIFFERENT seam moved trades a missing feature for a frozen game.
    //
