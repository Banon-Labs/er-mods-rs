//! Using the Challenger's Lynchpin without the wait and without the popup.
//!
//! Three separate mechanisms, each measured live on 2026-09-09 through Frida before any of it was
//! written here, and each recorded in `bd driving-an-inventory-item-use-needs-chrins-0x168`:
//!
//! 1. **Driving the use.** The inventory's `Use` command is only
//!    `CSMenuGaitemUseState::Request(&CSMenuMan->menuData->menuGaitemUseState, gaitem, arg)`, four
//!    stores into a 24-byte struct. `CS::PlayerIns::GetSelectedQuickSlotItemId` then overrides the
//!    real quick slot from that struct's `+0xc` unconditionally, which is the only reason an item
//!    that lives solely in the inventory can be used at all.
//! 2. **Making the use actually do something.** `ChrIns+0x168` is the repeat count TAE event 65
//!    loops on: `for (n = chrIns->field49_0x168; n != 0; n--)`. At zero the event fires and its
//!    whole body is skipped, so the animation plays, nothing is consumed, no effect applies and
//!    Seamless never hears about it. Five live drives died on exactly that and read as a broken
//!    item.
//! 3. **Shortening the animation.** `EquipParamGoods.goodsUseAnim`, the `u8` at row `+0x42`.
//!
//! # The animation lengths are measured, not chosen
//!
//! Each candidate was driven once and its clip read out of the TimeAct ring, where `animLength` is
//! the clip's length in the character's own seconds:
//!
//! | `goodsUseAnim` | TimeAct | seconds |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | 66 (what ersc.dll stamps) | 50530 | 5.000 |
//! | 8 (vanilla invasion fingers) | 50030 | 3.900 |
//! | 6 (Tiny Great Pot) | 50230 | 3.167 |
//! | 17 (Throwing Dagger) | 55000 | 1.433 |
//!
//! `CSChrBehaviorModule::animSpeedGradientMultiplier` was tried first and is not the lever: the
//! field takes the write, reads back changed, and the animation still runs its full length.
//!
//! # Why the row is written at runtime rather than in `regulation.bin`
//!
//! The Lynchpin's row is not in the regulation at all. `ersc.dll` allocates 0xb0 bytes at init and
//! stamps `goodsUseAnim = 0x42` into it, so the only place the value exists is the live row that
//! `EquipParamGoods::GetEntry` hands back (bd
//! `goods-use-anim-is-equipparamgoods-0x42-lynchpin-is-runtime-synthesised-2026-09-09`). One byte,
//! once, after Seamless has registered its rows.
//!
//! # The popup is skipped, not accepted and dismissed
//!
//! The first working version took Seamless's option and then called
//! `CSMenuManImp::CloseMenu(CSMenuMan, -1)`. That dismissed *every* dialog the game opened,
//! including the one the same item raises to leave an invasion, which has an activation window --
//! and it trapped the player in an invasion with no way out. See
//! `bd auto-dismiss-must-be-scoped-not-every-dialog-2026-09-09`.
//!
//! So the dialog is never built into view instead: the detour on `OpenConversationChoicesMenu`
//! declines to call the original only when Seamless's session reads idle, which is true when the
//! item is offering to start a search and never true once an invasion is live. Every other dialog,
//! the leave prompt included, falls through untouched.
