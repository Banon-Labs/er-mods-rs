//! The arrival oracle that decides whether a warp actually worked, and the three hotkeys that used
//! to trigger one.
//!
//! # The hotkeys no longer move the player
//!
//! Invasion locations are map markers, not fast-travel destinations
//! ([`er_invasion_warp_core::warp::WarpPolicy::MarkersOnly`]), so F7/F8/F9 are refused along with the
//! world map's own confirm. The refusal is taken HERE, at the top of the press handler, rather than
//! left to the warp call at the bottom: reaching that call means decoding the whole invasion
//! catalog and resolving thousands of candidate coordinates, and doing all of that on every press
//! to then decline is a stutter the player would feel for no reason.
//!
//! The keys are still read and still answer, because a key that does nothing at all and a key
//! whose handler is broken look identical from the outside. Pressing one now logs why.
//!
//! # The oracle is still live, and still needed
//!
//! [`note_external_warp`] is how the world-map confirm hook hands over a warp it issued, and the
//! arrival classification below is the only thing that can say a warp ARRIVED rather than merely
//! being requested. That is a distinction worth keeping wired up even while nothing issues one:
//! if the policy is ever revisited, the evidence path is the part that took real runs to build.
//!
//! What each key MEANT, kept because the selection helpers still implement it: F7 the nearest
//! point, F8 the catalog's stable order, F9 another AREA entirely. Only F7 needed world
//! coordinates -- see the note on the candidate set in [`InvasionWarpDrive::tick`] for why that
//! distinction is load-bearing.
//!
//! # Why hotkeys existed, when the goal was the world map (historical)
//!
//! The world-map surface is a shell around a warp call. Until that call was proven to relocate the
//! player and stream the destination, a map UI would have been decoration over an unknown. These
//! hotkeys were the smallest trigger that exercised the whole payload -- catalog -> engine
//! coordinate conversion -> target choice -> explicit spawn -> stage kick -> settled read-back --
//! and they answered the questions static RE could not: whether the world streams at the
//! destination, whether the disaster remap moves the block under us, and whether the yaw lands the
//! way the `.aip` table authored it. That work is done; the warp is proven and then deliberately
//! not offered. Read this section as the record of how the mechanism below was established, not as
//! a description of what pressing a key does today.
//!
//! # What "it worked" means here
//!
//! Not "the DLL loaded", not "no crash", and not "the hotkey fired". A warp counts only when
//! the player is READ BACK in the destination block within
//! [`er_invasion_warp_core::oracles::INVASION_WARP_POSITION_TOLERANCE_METRES`] of the requested
//! point ([`WarpArrival::Arrived`]). Landing in the right block at the wrong place is the
//! signature of the explicit-spawn slot not taking -- the engine falls back to the block's
//! default spawn -- and is reported as [`WarpArrival::Mislanded`], a FAILURE.
