//! The world-map seams this DLL detours, and the guard that refuses to hook a wrong build.
//!
//! # Two independent checks, and why both exist
//!
//! Every address here was byte-checked OFFLINE against `eldenring-deobf.bin` at shift 0
//! (`python3 scripts/check-dump-deobf-identity.py --count 32 0x<va>`). That proves the address
//! is right *for the image we reverse-engineered*. It says nothing about the image actually
//! running, which is why each seam also carries the first bytes of its prologue and
//! [`verify_seam`] re-reads them from live memory before anything is patched. A patch applied
//! to a differently-built game lands mid-instruction and crashes; refusing to hook merely costs
//! the feature.
//!
//! # What a prologue signature does and does not catch
//!
//! It catches DRIFT -- a different game build where the function moved or changed. It does NOT
//! identify which function this is: the three `BonfireWarp*` param lookups share a byte-identical
//! 12-byte prologue (`40 57 48 83 ec 40 48 c7 44 24 20 fe`) because they are the same
//! binary-search shape over different param tables. Only the RVA distinguishes them, and the RVA
//! is only as good as the offline byte-check that produced it. Do not "fix" a mismatch by
//! relaxing the signature.
//!
//! # Argument-count trap
//!
//! `er_hook`'s union dispatcher is a FOUR-argument `extern "system"` shape. A target taking five
//! or more register/stack arguments silently loses the extras -- including out-parameters the
//! callee writes through, which corrupts memory rather than failing loudly. Any seam added here
//! with more than four arguments must get its own typed `MhHook` instead of riding the union;
//! `arg_count` records the count so that decision is explicit rather than remembered.

/// One detour target: where it is, what it looks like, and how many arguments it takes.

/// Resolve a seam to a live address, refusing when the running build moved the function or when
/// the bytes there are not what we reversed.
///
/// # RESOLVE FIRST, BYTE-CHECK SECOND
///
/// The order is the fix. This used to byte-compare at `base + seam.rva` with no translation at
/// all, which on 1.17 reads whatever the patch put at a 1.16.2 address -- so every seam reported
/// [`SeamError::PrologueMismatch`], a message that blames the signature when the address is what
/// moved. The build gate is asked first now, and its refusal has its own variant.
///
/// # Why the DETOUR resolver and not the CALL one
///
/// All four callers hand the result straight to `er_hook::register_union_hook`; every one of them
/// is installing a detour. `resolve_game_address` answers "where is this function now", which is
/// what a CALL needs, and it will happily return a pair carried by the whole-image `.pdata` map.
/// A detour needs the further claim that the destination is a real function ENTRY with a
/// relocatable five-byte prologue, and only `resolve_detour_address` speaks to it -- letting the
/// weaker rows carry detours is what killed a boot on 2026-08-29. If a future caller wants one of
/// these seams as a plain CALL target, it must resolve with `resolve_game_address` itself rather
/// than loosening this.
///
/// # WHAT IT RETURNS IS THE UNRESOLVED ADDRESS, AND THAT IS THE POINT (corrected 2026-08-30)
///
/// The byte check runs at the RESOLVED address -- it has to, that is where the bytes are -- but
/// what comes back is `base + seam.rva`, untranslated, because `register_union_hook` resolves
/// again and must be the ONE resolve that decides where the detour lands.
///
/// This doc used to say the opposite: that resolving twice is idempotent for an address which is
/// already a 1.17 destination, so handing over the translated one is safe. That is true of most
/// addresses and false of exactly the ones that matter. An address can be BOTH a 1.17 destination
/// of one row and the 1.16.2 SOURCE of a different row -- which happens whenever a region's shift
/// equals the local spacing between two functions, so `B - A == C - B`. On such an address
/// translation WINS over the already-translated shortcut (it must; see `already_translated_in`),
/// and the second resolve silently returns a third, unrelated function. Three rows in the current
/// detour table have that shape (`0x6156c0`, `0x7ad710`, `0xbbbd90`), and on 2026-08-30 three live
/// detours in this workspace were measured landing on the wrong function because of it.
///
/// Resolving the same 1.16.2 INPUT twice is harmless and is what happens now: this function
/// resolves it to read the prologue, `register_union_hook` resolves it to place the detour, and
/// both get the same answer. Resolving the OUTPUT is the bug.
/// `scripts/check-double-resolved-hook-targets.py` is the gate that keeps it out.
///
/// On 1.16.2 `resolve_detour_address` returns its argument unchanged (`is_supported_build()`
/// short-circuits), so this whole step is a no-op there and the byte check runs at exactly the
/// address it always did.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Reads live process memory through the repo's fault-tolerant primitive, so an unmapped
/// address yields [`SeamError::Unreadable`] rather than a fault.
