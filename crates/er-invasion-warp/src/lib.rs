//! Standalone ME3-loadable shell for the world-map invasion-spawn warp feature.
//!
//! Loading this DLL through a me3 `[[natives]]` entry is what turns the feature on: the
//! shell installs a standalone host seam whose gate answers YES, so profile inclusion IS the
//! toggle and no env var or marker file is involved.
//!
//! # What it does today: ORACLE 1 only
//!
//! It registers ONE recurring game task (`CSTaskImp` / `FrameBegin`, the same registration
//! `er-telemetry` uses) which drives `er_invasion_warp_core::sampler`: a fail-closed read of the
//! live `CSAutoInvadePoint` coordinate table, re-taken until the totals settle, published as
//! `oracle_invasion_warp_catalog_targets` / `_blocks` / `_areas` into
//! `er-invasion-warp-telemetry.json` and this DLL's log next to the executable.
//!
//! It still installs NO detours, patches nothing, and writes nothing into the engine. Oracles
//! 2-5 (list rows, selected id, requested warp, final position) need the world-map interception
//! that is still only a design (docs/plans/world-map-invasion-warp.md), so they remain names.
//! Nothing here can start, fake or spoof invasion/multiplayer/session state -- the feature
//! reads one coordinate table.
//!
//! Unlike `er-loading-portrait` this DLL is safe to load ALONGSIDE `er_quickload.dll`:
//! it owns no Present detour and no MinHook instance. That stays true only while it installs
//! nothing; the first detour it adds must go through the `er-hook` union.

// A cdylib whose every consumer is `DllMain` and the game hooks/tasks it installs, all of them
// `#[cfg(windows)]`. On a host build the shell is compiled with its only callers cfg'd out, so
// `dead_code`/`unused_imports` there report the cfg, not real debt (measured 2026-08-21: 119 on
// the host, 0 on the shipping target). The SHIPPING target (x86_64-pc-windows-msvc) carries the
// full deny with no allows. `check.sh` host-runs this crate's tests, which is why the host build
// has to stay clean at all.
