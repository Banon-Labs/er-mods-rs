//! The local invasion filter, in the product DLL.
//!
//! Ports what the frida harness proved (`scripts/frida-ersc-session-trace.py`) into a shipped
//! feature:
//!
//! * the destination is readable at `CS::SosSignMan::SetMultiplayJoinData`, from
//!   `ServerPushJoinData+0x00`, before the player moves;
//! * rejecting a match by driving ERSC's "Cancel search" option is non-destructive -- the session
//!   walks `0x22 -> 0x00` and searching continues;
//! * the option actions share one signature, `(OSM, ctx, 1, 1)`, captured from real presses rather
//!   than inferred from a decompile -- though the static read below then showed `ctx` is never
//!   examined, which is what let the capture machinery be deleted.
//!
//! # What this deliberately does not do
//!
//! It does not fake an invasion, spoof session state, or enter `CSNetMan` / `QuickmatchManager` /
//! `CSBreakInPointManager`. It reads a destination the server already sent, and -- when the user
//! has asked for filtering -- invokes the same cancel the user could press by hand. Everything it
//! calls is a path the game runs anyway.
//!
//! # Why nothing in `ersc.dll` is hooked
//!
//! Asked directly whether the filter could avoid repeatedly cancelling, the binary answered no --
//! and answered something better instead. Static read of the shipped `ersc.dll`, first taken
//! 2026-08-05 and re-measured against the supported build:
//!
//! * `ersc+0x25850` ("Invade world") does one thing: require the session idle, take the mutex at
//!   `S+0x100`, bail if `S+0x14C == 0x7fffffff`, write `S+0x150 = 0xe`, release. Fifteen
//!   instructions on that path out of 31 in the whole `0x75`-byte function, the rest being the
//!   two fatal blocks it branches to. `ersc+0x258d0` ("Cancel search") is the same shape without
//!   the idle precondition, writing `0x23`. Neither queries anything.
//! * Across all 4903 functions in the unpacked `.text`, `0xe` reaches `S+0x150` at exactly one
//!   site -- the one above. There is no client-side candidate list to filter, because starting a
//!   search *is* that single store; everything after it happens inside the Themida-virtualised
//!   dispatcher and on the remote side. This is why `SetMultiplayJoinData` is not a late
//!   interception point but the first instant the destination exists on this machine, and why
//!   accept-then-reject is the only available shape.
//! * Both actions read **`rcx` only**. `rdx`, `r8` and `r9` are never touched. So the earlier plan
//!   -- hook the actions to capture a real press and replay its arguments -- was solving a problem
//!   that does not exist: `(OSM, 0, 1, 1)` is provably equivalent to what the engine passes.
//!
//! Every one of those findings survived the last Seamless update as a statement about the
//! mechanism, and none of them survived as a NUMBER: the addresses moved, the session fields moved
//! as a block, and the state enum was renumbered throughout. That is the reason the numbers above
//! live in [`ersc`] rather than in this prose, and the reason the module they describe is
//! identified by byte-checking the invade action before any of them is used.
//!
//! With the arguments unnecessary, the only thing still needed from Seamless is the OSM pointer.
//! Reading it out of a static would have meant hooking nothing in Seamless at all; that was
//! attempted and does not work (see [`ersc::NEXT_OBJECT_OFFSET`] for the candidate that looked
//! right and was not). So OSM is learned by observing it being passed to the menu builder.
//!
//! What that leaves is **two** detours: `CS::SosSignMan::SetMultiplayJoinData`, a game function,
//! where matches are judged; and `ersc!show`, the Seamless menu builder, which is observed
//! read-only -- it copies `rcx` and immediately runs the original with every argument untouched,
//! changing nothing and suppressing nothing. The two option actions are not hooked, and a rejection
//! invokes the same callback the user's own click invokes, with arguments the callee provably
//! ignores. `nothing_in_this_module_detours_ersc`'s successor test pins that budget so growing it
//! is a decision rather than a drift.
//!
//! `ersc.dll` is RELOCATABLE and has no fixed load address, so every ERSC address is
//! `module base + RVA` resolved at runtime and byte-checked before use. If Seamless is not
//! loaded the filter never arms: without a Seamless session there are no Seamless invasions
//! to filter.
//!
//! # Which Seamless build
//!
//! The latest seamless co-OP only. `ersc.dll` is third-party and the user updates it on their own
//! schedule; chasing every past build with its own address set is unbounded work on a moving
//! target, and it buys a co-op player nothing, because Seamless rotates the lobby-key salt on
//! release and so clients of different builds cannot see each other's sessions anyway.
//!
//! [`resolve_ersc_abi`] therefore picks from [`ersc::SUPPORTED`] -- currently one entry -- by
//! byte-checking the invade action, an entry point this module calls but never hooks, so its bytes
//! stay the shipped ones. Exactly one has to match; zero or two both refuse. The table shape stays
//! because Seamless will update again and the next build is another entry, not a rewrite.
//!
//! # Fail-closed direction
//!
//! Every uncertainty resolves toward not cancelling. Config missing or unparseable, OSM not
//! resolvable, ERSC absent, ERSC present but a build we have not measured, anchor unresolved --
//! all leave matches alone. The failure this guards against is silently cancelling other players'
//! invasions, which is worse than a filter that quietly does nothing. That is also why the byte
//! checks run all the way through each action's state write rather than stopping at a prologue:
//! five different functions share the option-action opening, and the write is the only
//! instruction that says which one this is.
