//! The local invasion filter, in the product DLL.
//!
//! Ports what the frida harness proved (`scripts/frida-ersc-session-trace.py`) into a shipped
//! feature:
//!
//! * the destination is readable at `CS::SosSignMan::SetMultiplayJoinData`, from
//!   `ServerPushJoinData+0x00`, before the player moves;
//! * rejecting a match by driving ERSC's "Cancel search" option is non-destructive -- the session
//!   walks `0x22 -> 0x00` and searching continues;
//! * the option actions share one signature, `(OSM, ctx, 1, 1)`, captured from real presses rather
//!   than inferred from a decompile -- though the static read below then showed `ctx` is never
//!   examined, which is what let the capture machinery be deleted.
//!
//! # What this deliberately does NOT do
//!
//! It does not fake an invasion, spoof session state, or enter `CSNetMan` / `QuickmatchManager` /
//! `CSBreakInPointManager`. It reads a destination the server already sent, and -- when the user
//! has asked for filtering -- invokes the same cancel the user could press by hand. Everything it
//! calls is a path the game runs anyway.
//!
//! # Why nothing in `ersc.dll` is hooked
//!
//! Asked directly whether the filter could avoid repeatedly cancelling, the binary answered no --
//! and answered something better instead. Static read of the shipped `ersc.dll` (v1.9.9),
//! 2026-08-05:
//!
//! * `ersc+0x243e0` ("Invade world") is nine instructions: take the mutex at `S+0xC0`, bail if
//!   `S+0x10C == 0x7fffffff`, write `S+0x110 = 0xd`, release. `ersc+0x24460` ("Cancel search") is
//!   the same shape writing `0x22`. Neither queries anything.
//! * Across all 4839 functions in the unpacked `.text`, `0xd` reaches `S+0x110` at exactly ONE
//!   site -- the one above. There is no client-side candidate list to filter, because starting a
//!   search *is* that single store; everything after it happens inside the Themida-virtualised
//!   dispatcher and on the remote side. This is why `SetMultiplayJoinData` is not a late
//!   interception point but the FIRST instant the destination exists on this machine, and why
//!   accept-then-reject is the only available shape.
//! * Both actions read **`rcx` only**. `rdx`, `r8` and `r9` are never touched. So the earlier plan
//!   -- hook the actions to capture a real press and replay its arguments -- was solving a problem
//!   that does not exist: `(OSM, 0, 1, 1)` is provably equivalent to what the engine passes.
//!
//! With the arguments unnecessary, the only thing still needed from Seamless is the OSM pointer.
//! Reading it out of a static would have meant hooking nothing in Seamless at all; that was
//! attempted and does not work (see [`ersc::NEXT_OBJECT_OFFSET`] for the candidate that looked
//! right and was not). So OSM is learned by observing it being passed to the menu builder.
//!
//! What that leaves is **two** detours: `CS::SosSignMan::SetMultiplayJoinData`, a GAME function,
//! where matches are judged; and `ersc!show`, the Seamless menu builder, which is observed
//! read-only -- it copies `rcx` and immediately runs the original with every argument untouched,
//! changing nothing and suppressing nothing. The two option ACTIONS are NOT hooked, and a rejection
//! invokes the same callback the user's own click invokes, with arguments the callee provably
//! ignores. `nothing_in_this_module_detours_ersc`'s successor test pins that budget so growing it
//! is a decision rather than a drift.
//!
//! `ersc.dll` is RELOCATABLE and has no fixed load address, so every ERSC address is
//! `module base + RVA` resolved at runtime and byte-checked before use. If Seamless is not
//! loaded the filter never arms: without a Seamless session there are no Seamless invasions
//! to filter.
//!
//! # Fail-closed direction
//!
//! Every uncertainty resolves toward NOT cancelling. Config missing or unparseable, OSM not
//! resolvable, ERSC absent, anchor unresolved -- all leave matches alone. The failure this guards
//! against is silently cancelling other players' invasions, which is worse than a filter that
//! quietly does nothing.

    // `a` IS the option-menu object: that is `show`'s first parameter, and the prologue at this
    // address was byte-checked before the hook went in. Storing it is therefore not a guess, and
    // it is deliberately NOT gated on a content check.
    //
    // It used to be gated on the `seamless` tag at `+0x68`, and that silently broke the whole
    // feature on 2026-08-05: a real match was judged and rejected, then `cannot cancel -- session
    // is not resolvable`, because the tag never matched and OSM was consequently never stored. The
    // tag had been measured ONCE, live, in one frida session; promoting a single observation to a
    // precondition is what turned it into a gate on the product path. It is now reported as a
    // diagnostic and believed by nothing.
    // Opening Seamless's menu is the user reaching for the controls, so the auto-search loop stands
    // down here -- before they have even chosen an option.
    //
    // This replaces inferring "the user cancelled" from the session reaching `0x22`, which was
    // wrong on its face: the static scan of ersc.dll found SEVEN sites writing `0x22` to `S+0x110`
    // and only one of them is the Cancel-search action, so every internal abort read as a user
    // cancel. Menu-open is unambiguous, needs no new detour, and fails in the safe direction --
    // the worst case is that the loop stops when the user only wanted a look, which costs a
    // keypress, where the old rule's worst case was fighting them for control.
    //
    // `IN_OUR_CALL` guards the reentrant case: driving the cancel option can make Seamless rebuild
    // its own menu, which lands right back here. Without the guard this module would read its own
    // cancel as the user opening the menu and stand itself down after every single rejection.
