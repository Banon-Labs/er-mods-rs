//! Writes to pin rows that ALREADY EXIST -- the live half of the world-map surface.
//!
//! Split from `map_hooks` because the two halves have opposite safety rules and conflating them is
//! what produced the 2026-08-05 crash. `map_hooks` builds the row list inside the
//! `WorldMapViewModel` constructor, the one moment the buffer may be relocated. This module never
//! appends, never reserves and never allocates: it writes fields in rows the constructor already
//! placed, so the buffer cannot move and no raw row pointer a fast-travel dialog holds can dangle.
//!
//! Two things are being solved here, and they share the same machinery:
//!
//! 1. RE-COLOURING. Marking a location has to change the map while the player is standing there,
//!    because the list is not rebuilt until the next world entry.
//! 2. TOPPING UP. A dungeon whose MSB became resident since the last world entry has points that
//!    have nowhere to go. The constructor reserves dormant rows for exactly this; a top-up claims
//!    one and retargets it.
//!
//! # The ownership rule, learned the expensive way
//!
//! A recorded row address is not permission to write to it. Freed MenuHeap pages stay MAPPED, so a
//! fault-tolerant read of a destroyed ViewModel's buffer succeeds and returns whatever now lives
//! there. A run that trusted a four-bit id-range check repainted 456 rows inside other objects and
//! crashed the game. Every write below is gated on, in order: the ViewModel read LIVE from the
//! engine's own `CSPopupMenu+0x250` slot (nulled by the same function that frees the object), that
//! being the same object our span was recorded against, the list still beginning where it did, and
//! the row pointing into the param slab this DLL leaked. The last is a full 64-bit match on an
//! address only we hand out.

///
/// Everything else in this module changes what the NEXT ViewModel is built with, and measurement
/// says there is no next one: closing and reopening the world map does not re-run the constructor
/// (`opens=2`, no `ctor #3`, live 2026-08-05), and neither does switching map layer -- the ctor is
/// reachable only from `STEP_MoveMap_Init`. So a mark made while playing could never reach the
/// screen, no matter how correct the param rows were, and they were correct: the log's tier tally
/// proved it.
///
/// # Why writing the icon alone was not enough
///
/// The icon field is not re-read on its own. `SetTo` (0x14087ae20) is what issues the clip's
/// `GotoAndStop(frame)`, and a clip slot is re-bound only when the draw's cached id differs from
/// `row+0x08`. Rewriting `row+0x248` therefore updated a field nothing would look at again. Each
/// repaint below bumps `row+0x08` to a fresh generation as well, which is the write that actually
/// makes the change appear.
///
/// Only rows this DLL injected are touched. Span membership alone is not authorisation to write --
/// a span outlives its ViewModel, and the block returns to the same heap at the same size class --
/// so each row must also still carry our own `+0x08` stamp.
///
/// Returns `(examined, rewritten)`.
