//! Puts a line of text on the game's own auto-closing announcement surface.
//!
//! This is the surface that says "Grace discovered" — it appears, scrolls, expires, and never
//! waits for input. It replaces a deleted `system_message` module, which used `showPopupMenu` and
//! therefore produced a BLOCKING MODAL WITH AN OK BUTTON: the user got a dialog they had to dismiss
//! for every rejection, showing squares and then nothing, while the unattended dialog held the
//! Seamless session open long enough to trip the stall watchdog. `showPopupMenu` is named a popup
//! *menu* and behaves like one; that it was chosen at all was a failure to read.
//!
//! # Why this surface can do what a modal cannot
//!
//! `CS::AnnounceMessage` carries a `DLString<wchar_t>` **directly** rather than a message id, so
//! arbitrary text needs no FMG entry — which was the open question that made this feature look
//! impossible. And `FeSystemAnnounceView` owns `systemAnnounceScrollBufferTimer` and
//! `systemAnnounceScrollCount`: it times itself out. Nothing here waits for a button.
//!
//! # How the message gets in without the queue
//!
//! `FeSystemAnnounceView::Update` drains the view-model's queue ONLY when its own embedded message
//! is inactive, disassembled at `0x1408c481a`:
//!
//! ```text
//!   cmpb $0x0, 0xb10(%rbx)     ; if (!view->msg.is_active)
//!   call 0x140841b00           ;     popped = queue.pop()
//!   call 0x1408c4710           ;     view->msg = *popped
//!   movb $0x1, 0xb50(%rbx)     ;     announcePlayState = Load
//!   cmpb $0x0, 0xb10(%rbx)     ; if (view->msg.is_active)
//!   call 0x1408c48c0           ;     display step
//! ```
//!
//! So filling `view->msg` ourselves is byte-for-byte the state a successful pop would have left,
//! and Update walks straight to the display step. The queue is bypassed rather than fought — which
//! matters, because the queue's push function is not symbolised and was never found.
//!
//! # Where the text comes from, and why NOT the embedded `DLString`
//!
//! The display step's `Load` case picks the string like this (`0x1408c48c0`):
//!
//! ```text
//!   text = msg->field8_0x8;                       // +0x08, a raw wchar_t*
//!   if (text == NULL) {                           // only then, the embedded DLString
//!       text = &msg->text.string;                 // SSO: inline buffer...
//!       if (msg->text.capacity > 7) text = *text; // ...or the heap pointer
//!   }
//!   FUN_14074a000(&view->textWidget, text);
//! ```
//!
//! [`MSG_TEXT_POINTER_OFFSET`] is checked FIRST and used verbatim when non-null, so pointing it at
//! a buffer we own is the engine's own primary path — no allocator, no string type, no growth.
//!
//! The obvious-looking alternative, calling the game's `DLString::assign` on `msg->text`, is what
//! shipped first and it produced A BANNER WITH NO TEXT ON IT (live, 2026-08-12). The cause is
//! visible in a read of the live message: the view's EMBEDDED message is never populated by the
//! game unless the game itself announces something, so its `DLString` is all zeroes — including
//! `allocator`. `assign` memcpys in place only while `capacity >= length`; for anything longer it
//! delegates to a grow that needs that null allocator. Nothing crashed and nothing was copied, so
//! `capacity` stayed `0`, the null-check above fell through to the SSO branch, and the inline
//! buffer it read was the zeroed one — an empty string, drawn as an empty banner, while our own
//! `SHOWN` counter said the notice had been placed. A counter that proves the WRITE happened is
//! not evidence the PIXELS changed.
//!
//! # Buffer lifetime
//!
//! The pointer is raw and the game never takes ownership of it: `AnnounceMessage`'s copy
//! (`0x1408c4710`) propagates `field8_0x8` by value, and the `Dequeue` state only clears
//! `is_active`. Nothing frees it, so the buffer must outlive the scroll and fade — and it is
//! therefore leaked, the same choice and the same reason as the synthetic param rows. The leak is
//! bounded in practice by the notice policy, which announces only a CHANGE of destination: a long
//! session is tens of messages of under 200 bytes each. Leaking is also what makes this race-free
//! without a lock — a buffer that is never freed cannot dangle under a view still reading it.
