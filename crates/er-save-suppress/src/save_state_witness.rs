// WHO ABANDONED THE SAVE. The instrument that names the frame in which `GameMan.saveState` stops
// describing a save request the SL device is still holding.
//
// `include!`d into `lib.rs` like `save_orphan_drain.rs`, whose block above it establishes the state
// this one hunts the CAUSE of. That block ends at "once `saveState` leaves 1 with `+0x10` still
// populated, nothing will ever poll the device again"; everything here is about the word "leaves".
//
// WHAT STATIC ANALYSIS SETTLED, AND WHERE IT STOPPED (1.16.2 decompiles, shift 0). Exactly three
// writes can take `saveState` out of 1 while leaving `iodev+0x10` populated:
//
//  1. `FUN_140679180` -> `FUN_140e6e080` returns 4 on the spot when `iodev+0x18 == 0` (that field
//     belongs to a LOAD, so it is 0 for the whole life of a save) and releases nothing; the wrapper
//     then writes `saveState = 0` for any answer that is not 0 or 1. No other state is required, so
//     this is the one that needs no coincidence.
//  2. `FUN_140679180`'s own first branch writes `saveState = 3` when `GameMan+0xdd0` is a non-empty
//     string -- also without releasing. That leaves the orphan one write short, and needs a second
//     writer to bring 3 down to 0.
//  3. `FUN_140679510` -> `FUN_140e6e430` -> (`iodev+0x28 != 0`) `FUN_140e6f370` can return 9 after
//     clearing `+0x28` alone, and the wrapper writes `saveState = 0`. Narrower: it needs a deferred
//     file cap parked on the device and its enqueue to fail.
//
// Every OTHER non-1 answer from either poll passes through `FUN_140e6f200` first, so it clears
// `+0x10` on the way out and cannot produce the signature. That is as far as reading gets: all three
// are reachable, and which one fired is a fact about a particular frame, not about the code.
//
// SO THIS WITNESS ANSWERS THE REMAINING QUESTION AND NOTHING ELSE. It chains onto both wrappers,
// samples the device and `saveState` either side of the call, and reports the transitions that leave
// a save latched with nobody polling it -- with the caller's RVA, which is the part no decompile can
// supply, and which the decode table in `save_state_device.rs` turns into a function name.
//
// IT FORWARDS EVERY CALL UNCHANGED AND CHANGES NO RETURN VALUE. It writes game memory in exactly
// one place: on the LOAD-poll site it calls `restore_save_state_owner`, putting `saveState` back to
// the 1 the game held one instruction earlier, so the save it just lost goes back to the game's own
// pump. `save_state_device.rs` carries why that is a repair rather than a policy, and why the SAVE
// lane deliberately does NOT get the same treatment: its only non-releasing answer comes from
// `FUN_140e6f370`, which clears `iodev+0x28` on the way out, so a re-poll takes a DIFFERENT branch
// and the state it leaves is the orphan `drain_orphaned_save_request` is built for. Restoring there
// would hand a repaired-looking state to a repair that then cannot see it.
//
// WHY BOTH WRAPPERS AND NOT JUST THE LOAD POLL. Reporting only `FUN_140679180` would make case 3
// invisible, and an instrument that can only confirm the hypothesis it was built for is not
// evidence. Both are chained through the hook union, so the product's existing detour on
// `FUN_140679180` (the menu trace) keeps working and neither owner is silently dropped.
