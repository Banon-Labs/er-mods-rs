// THE `saveState` FIELD ITSELF: reading it, and putting back the one write that kills a save.
//
// `include!`d into `lib.rs` like the blocks around it. `save_orphan_drain.rs` names the dead state
// and repairs it after the fact; `save_state_witness.rs` names the frame that creates it. This
// file owns the field those two share, and the single write that stops the state from forming.
//
// WHY THE REPAIR BELONGS AT THE FIELD AND NOT AT THE CALLER (1.16.2 decompile, shift 0; the 1.17
// bodies at `0x140679fd0` / `0x140e6fe80` are the same code):
//
// `FUN_140e6e080`, the LOAD-side status call, opens
//
//     if (iodev+0x18 == 0 || iodev+0x20 == 0) return 4;
//
// `+0x18` is the LOAD's payload pointer, so it is 0 for the entire life of a SAVE. Its wrapper
// `FUN_140679180` then writes `saveState = 0` for any answer that is not 0 or 1. So ONE call to
// that wrapper while a save owns the device takes the mutex off the save having released nothing,
// and every later submit is refused by `FUN_140e6ef60`'s `iodev+0x10 == 0 && iodev+0x20 == 0`
// precondition -- for the rest of the process, because nothing polls a save the game no longer
// believes is in flight. That is the SHAPE of the 2026-08-31 wedge, in which 8629 of 8638
// dispatches declined; which write produced it there is still open (see the end of this block).
//
// `CS::MoveMapStep::DoSaveStuff` never does this. It enters the wrapper only under
// `GameMan::IsSaveState2()`, i.e. only for a load it is actually waiting on. FOUR other callers
// have no such guard, and Ghidra's xref set for the wrapper is exactly these five on BOTH images
// (the sixth reference is a `.pdata` unwind record, not a call), so the list is complete rather
// than merely the ones someone happened to find:
//
//   1.16.2 call   1.17 call    containing function                       guarded on `saveState`?
//   0x82a787      0x82b777     MenuJob step, 0x60000 buffer,             NO
//                              `GameSettings::LoadDefault` -- game settings
//   0x82ab46      0x82bb36     MenuJob step, 0x240010 buffer,            NO
//                              `FUN_140257340` -- system data
//   0x82c286      0x82d276     MenuJob step, 0x280000 buffer,            NO
//                              `SetSaveSlot` + `ProfileSummary` -- character slot
//   0xaf1a46      0xaf2d56     `CS::MoveMapListStep::STEP_LoadSaveData_Wait`  NO
//   0xafbc2b      0xafcf4b     `CS::MoveMapStep::DoSaveStuff`            YES (`IsSaveState2`)
//
// The call OFFSET inside each function is identical on both builds (0x37, 0x26, 0x46, 0x16,
// 0x15b), which is an independent check that the five pairs are the same code. When the witness
// reports `oracle_save_state_first_caller_rva`, that hex is the RETURN address -- the call above
// plus 5 -- so subtract 5 and read the row.
//
// In vanilla none of the four unguarded callers can meet a save, because each of them runs only
// while the load IT submitted owns the device (`saveState == 2`), and a save cannot submit at
// `saveState == 2`. The product's own reload removes that coincidence: it submits and CONSUMES the
// save-data read itself before `continue_confirm`, so the native world-load transition can reach a
// poll with no load outstanding and `saveState` back at 0, which is long enough for an autosave to
// take the device and meet an unguarded poll.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM. The 2026-08-31 wedge is NOT known to have come through this door. That
// run hooked `FUN_140679180` from boot (`b80_poll_679180` in `er-quickload-continue-trace.log`,
// unthrottled) and recorded exactly SEVEN calls, the last of them the product's own reload drain,
// BEFORE the autosave that latched -- so on that run the wrapper was never called again and cannot
// be the writer. The repair below is correct where it applies and inert otherwise; it closes one
// of the doors, and the run's own trace says it was not the door used. See bd
// `the-2026-08-31-wedge-was-not-the-load-poll-two-of-three-strand-writes-ruled-out-2026-08-31`.
//
// WHAT THIS REPAIR DOES, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO. It puts `saveState` back to 1 -- the value the
// game itself had one instruction earlier -- when a poll left it elsewhere with the save still on
// the device. It does NOT change the wrapper's return value, so every caller behaves exactly as it
// does today; it does not poll, enqueue or release anything; and it hands the save back to the
// game's own pump (`DoSaveStuff` under `IsSaveState1` -> `FUN_140679510` -> `FUN_140e6e430`),
// which is the code that owns finishing it. That is deliberately NOT a private pump: the repair is
// one dword, and the native owner does the work.
//
// The failure mode if the pump never arrives is `saveState == 1` with a save on the device -- which
// is indistinguishable from an ordinary in-flight save, keeps `FUN_14067b940`'s `saveState == 0`
// guard closed so the request stays latched and retries, and is recoverable the moment any pump
// runs. The state it replaces is unrecoverable.
