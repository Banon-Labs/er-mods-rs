// THE WRITE-COMPLETION EVENT for a bypassed save.
//
// `include!`d into `lib.rs` so it shares the crate's flat module namespace (same pattern
// the product's telemetry writers use) while keeping each file under the size gate.
//
// `FUN_14240fd70` == `SaveLoad2::SLSaveSession`'s job body, the function the SL worker
// thread runs to perform one save. Its RETURN is the moment the bypassed save has finished
// writing, and it is the ONLY completion signal in this chain that does not require
// somebody to poll.
//
// Why a poll cannot be relied on (1.16.2 decompile, shift 0):
//
//   * `FUN_140e6e430` (the status poll) reports "terminal" as case `0x14`, and 0x14 is
//     produced by `FUN_14240a1f0` ONLY when `FUN_14240c270(queue, id)` fails to find the
//     job -- i.e. after the worker has REMOVED it from the queue. It is strictly later than
//     the write, and nothing in the job body ever sets a terminal state itself: the body
//     sets `job+0x98` to 0x16 on entry and 2 mid-write, and BOTH map to the poll's
//     `break -> return 1` ("still in flight") arm.
//   * The poll has exactly two consumers: `CS::MoveMapStep::DoSaveStuff`, gated on
//     `GameMan::IsSaveState1()`, and `FUN_14082a0f0`, the "saving..." MenuJob. The Save Game
//     commit closes the menus BEFORE it fires (deliberately -- it is what stops the b73-only
//     lane stealing the bypass token), so the MenuJob consumer may not exist at all for our
//     commit.
//
// A measured switch-then-save commit confirmed the consequence: the file was rewritten in
// place and verified, and `bypass_final_status` was still unset 900 ticks later.
//
// The body's own result is right there when it returns. `SLSession` (base ctor
// `FUN_14240d110`) holds a refcounted `SaveLoad2::detail::SLSessionResultInfo*` at `+0xa0`;
// `FUN_14240ebd0` initialises its `+0x10` code to 0, every failure path in the body writes a
// non-zero code there through `FUN_14240dc40`, and `FUN_14240a180` -- the getter the poll
// itself uses on the terminal arm -- reads that exact field. Reading it at the body's return
// therefore yields the same verdict the poll would eventually report, one queue-drain
// earlier and with nobody having to ask.
