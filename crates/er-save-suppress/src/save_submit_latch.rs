// WHICH SUBMIT LATCHED THE DEVICE, AND DID ITS LANE ACCEPT.
//
// `include!`d into `lib.rs` like the blocks around it, and built on the same observer shape as
// `save_state_witness.rs` / `save_state_writers.rs`: forward every call unchanged, sample either
// side, write no game memory. It adds no fifth mechanism -- it moves the vantage point.
//
// WHY THE VANTAGE POINT HAD TO MOVE. Four rounds of instruments watched `GameMan.saveState` and
// asked which store took it off 1. The answer, measured on 2026-08-31 run `wedge-writers-20260831-d`
// with all six stores in the image witnessed, was NONE: `writer_state_exits = 2`, both of them
// healthy completions with the device CLEAR, and `exits_at_wedge = 0`. A wedge existed anyway --
// `iodev+0x10 = 0x9c9a1580`, `iodev+0x20 = 0xacc43e40`, `saveState = 0`.
//
// There is exactly one shape left that produces that reading with no zero-writer at all: a submit
// that LATCHED the device and whose lane never accepted, so `saveState` was never written to 1 in
// the first place and never had to be written back down. The writer set being complete and silent
// is not a contradiction under that shape -- it is what that shape predicts.
//
// So the question this file answers is the one neither the writer witness nor the reload trace
// carries: for the `SLSaveContent` sitting on the device at the wedge, WHICH submit put it there,
// what did that submit's builder return, and did the lane that called it go on to accept?
//
// THE THREE SITES, and why these three (1.16.2 decompiles, shift 0; the 1.17 bodies are byte-equal
// under the alignment key -- see the derivation block below):
//
//   `FUN_140e6ef60`  the COMBINED lane's submit builder. Sole caller `FUN_14067b940`, the lane the
//                    2026-08-31 wedge sample names (`lane = 3`). Writes `iodev+0x10` BEFORE its
//                    heap-capability guard and can return 0 afterwards.
//   `FUN_140e6ec70`  the CHARACTER/SYSTEM builder -- a 15-byte tail-call dispatcher, `cmp
//                    byte [rcx+0x40],0 / jne FUN_140e6f760 / jmp FUN_140e6f940`, so hooking it sees
//                    BOTH sub-builders and all three of its lanes (`FUN_14067b750`,
//                    `FUN_14067b570`, `FUN_14067bc10`) in one place.
//   `FUN_140e6fb50`  the ENQUEUE, and the reason a negative here still means something: it is the
//                    ONLY writer of `iodev+0x20` and every builder in the subsystem funnels through
//                    it, including `FUN_140e6ec80` (the PREVIEW lane's builder, which is NOT
//                    hooked). A device holding a non-zero `+0x20` that this site never saw was
//                    latched by something outside the whole SL submit path.
//
// WHAT THE STATIC READ ALREADY SETTLES, so a run is not asked to re-derive it. Every builder's
// failure path was decompiled rather than assumed:
//
//   * `FUN_140e6fb50` stores its job into `iodev+0x20` and, when `FUN_14240ae10` hands back null,
//     calls `FUN_140e6f200` -- the full release -- before returning false. An enqueue that FAILS
//     therefore leaves the device CLEAN, and "the enqueue failed and stranded the content" is
//     false for every lane.
//   * `FUN_140e6ec70`'s `param_3 >= 0xc` fall-out calls `FUN_140e6f200` too. bd
//     `e6ec70-can-latch-the-device-without-accepting-so-savestate-is-never-written-2026-08-31`
//     records that arm as a latch-without-accept hole with no release; the 1.16.2 decompile read
//     for THIS file has the release, so that memory's rendering is wrong about this build. It is
//     recorded here rather than silently dropped, because the two readings disagree and the code
//     is the one that runs.
//   * `FUN_140e6f940`'s deferred arm (`iodev+0x28 != 0`) returns 1 with `+0x20` still null -- an
//     ACCEPT with no job. That is a real latch shape, and it is the one the 2026-08-31 sample
//     excludes on its own evidence (`+0x28 == 0`, `+0x20` a live pointer).
//
// None of that names the frame. A builder that returns 0 with `+0x10` still populated is a fact
// about one call, and the only way to have it is to be standing there when it happens.
//
// ADDRESS DERIVATION, and why it is not a constant. `0x140e6ef60` and `0x140e6ec70` are not rows in
// `rva-map-1162-to-1170.verified.tsv` or `...needed-verified.tsv`, so `resolve_detour_address`
// would REFUSE them and the hooks would silently not exist. Rather than widen a ledger this branch
// does not own, each builder is derived FROM THE RUNNING IMAGE, which is what
// `MhHook::new_runtime_derived` / `register_union_hook_runtime_derived` exist for:
//
//   1. its calling lane IS in the ledger and is `IDENTICAL-WHOLE` with identical `.pdata` extents
//      (`0x67b940 -> 0x67c790` PDATA:0x2cc/0x2cc; `0x67b750 -> 0x67c5a0` 0x1e3/0x1e3;
//      `0x67b570 -> 0x67c3c0` 0x1d6/0x1d6; `0x67bc10 -> 0x67ca60` 0x11f/0x11f), so the offset of a
//      call inside it survives the move;
//   2. `resolve_call_site_rva` places that call on the running build;
//   3. the `E8 rel32` there is DECODED, so the address comes out of the image rather than out of
//      arithmetic on a base;
//   4. `write_site_is_sound` then asks the running image's own `.pdata` whether the destination is
//      a function entry (or an unwind-less leaf) with room for MinHook's five bytes.
//
// The char builder is derived from all THREE of its lanes and the three answers must agree, which
// is a check no single derivation can make on itself.
//
// OFFLINE EVIDENCE FOR THE PAIRS, recorded here because it cannot go in a ledger this branch may
// not write. `scripts/diff-function-bodies-1162-1170.py`, `.pdata` extents from
// `scripts/pdata-lookup-1162-1170.py`, and the `E8` decode from both images:
//
//   1.16.2      1.17        verdict                          entry evidence        patch site

// Both new verdicts are in `EXHAUSTIVE_VERDICTS`, so neither is a loosened score; they are recorded
// as prose here only because the row cannot be added to `docs/recon/rva-map-*.tsv` from this branch.
// `0xe6fb50` is already an audited row and resolves through the table like any other constant.
//
// THE PREVIEW LANE IS DELIBERATELY NOT HOOKED. `FUN_140e6ec80` (`0xe70a80` on 1.17) is the fourth
// builder, called only by `FUN_14067b4e0`. Its 1.17 entry sits exactly 0x10 bytes past the char
// stub's, which is the OVERLAP window `scripts/audit-1170-hook-targets.py` refuses -- two detours
// that close together share MinHook's patch/relocation neighbourhood. The enqueue observer covers
// its `+0x20` write instead, and a latch that reaches no site at all is reported as
// [`LATCH_MATCH_NO_OBSERVATION`] rather than as an absence.
