// THE FORGOTTEN SAVE REQUEST, and the repair that lets the game take it back.
//
// `include!`d into `lib.rs` so it shares the crate's flat module namespace (the same pattern
// `save_job_completion.rs` and `save_write_branch.rs` use) while keeping each file under the
// size gate.

// ============================================================================
// THE ORPHANED SAVE REQUEST. The state in which the game has forgotten a save it
// submitted, and therefore the state in which SAVING STOPS FOR THE REST OF THE PROCESS.
//
// MEASURED (run br-20260831-160354-2513, after one System->Quit->Load Character reload):
// `oracle_save_dispatch_declines = 6177 of 6186 calls`, every decline carrying the same
// two pointers for four minutes --
//
//   +0x10 save_content=0x9ad1d280  +0x18 load_content=0x0  +0x20 job=0x18e319ea0
//   +0x28 file_cap=0x0             [save-content-and-job-latched-0x10+0x20]
//
// -- while `GameMan.saveState` read 0. That combination is UNREACHABLE while the game
// still owns the request, and it is permanent. The proof is three decompiled facts
// (1.16.2, shift 0):
//
//  1. `iodev+0x10`/`+0x20` are cleared by `FUN_140e6f200` and by nothing else.
//  2. On the SAVE side the only path that reaches `FUN_140e6f200` is the poll
//     `FUN_140e6e430`, whose only two callers are `FUN_140679510` and `FUN_1406794b0`,
//     which are in turn reached only from `CS::MoveMapStep::DoSaveStuff` -- gated on
//     `GameMan::IsSaveState1()` -- and from the "saving..." MenuJob `FUN_14082a0f0`.
//  3. Every submit path sets `saveState = 1` at its commit tail (`FUN_14067b940`,
//     `FUN_14067b750`, `FUN_14067b570`, `FUN_14067bc10`), so `+0x10 != 0` and
//     `saveState == 1` are set together and cleared together.
//
// Once `saveState` leaves 1 with `+0x10` still populated, (2) says nothing will ever poll
// the device again, so (1) says the request is never released -- and every later submit
// builder (`FUN_140e6ef60`, `FUN_140e6ec70`) fails its opening
// `iodev+0x10 == 0 && iodev+0x20 == 0` guard. Autosave, rest, quit-save and the Save Game
// row are all refused, silently, forever. Elden Ring shows no error for a save that is
// never attempted, so the player keeps playing and loses everything they do.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES ABOUT IT. It runs the game's OWN poll, `FUN_140e6e430(iodev)`, once per
// refused dispatch that carries this signature. Nothing here decides whether the request
// may be freed: the poll's `case 0x14` arm frees it only when `FUN_14240a1f0(job)` reports
// terminal, which is the same guard `DoSaveStuff` would have applied on the frame the game
// forgot to. A job still in flight lands in a `break -> return 1` arm and NOTHING is
// touched. That is the same discipline the load side already follows in
// [`note_load_consumer`], and for the same reason: a guard we re-derive is a guard that can
// disagree with the game about whether a write is still running, and the object being freed
// is one the SL worker thread may still be writing through.
//
// WHY IT IS SAFE TO CALL FROM A DECLINE. `FUN_140e6f200` frees BOTH sides of the device
// (`+0x10`, `+0x18`, `+0x20`, `+0x28`), so a poll fired while a LOAD owns the job would
// take that load's payload away before its consumer ever saw it. [`save_request_is_orphaned`]
// therefore demands the load side be empty and `saveState` be exactly IDLE -- which
// excludes a save in flight (1) and a load in any of its phases (2, 3, 7) -- and refuses to
// act on an unreadable sample. The decline itself already implies `saveState == 0`
// (`FUN_140afb880` picks no lane otherwise), so the check is a restatement the code can be
// read against rather than a new assumption.
//
// WHY THE FIRST REFUSED SAVE IS NOT LOST. A declining lane touches nothing --
// `GameMan+0xb72`/`+0xb73` stay set -- so `FUN_140afb880` re-enters it on the next frame.
// The drain runs between those two entries, so the save the user was owed is built one
// frame later instead of never.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT DONE. `FUN_140679510` would additionally retire
// `GameMan+0xbb8`/`+0xbc0` and write `saveState = 0`. That accounting is not replicated
// here: `saveState` is already 0 by the predicate above, and `+0xbb8` is read by that
// function alone -- the next genuine save's own poll retires it. Writing GameMan from an
// instrument to tidy a counter would be exactly the re-derivation this design refuses.
// ============================================================================

/// `GameMan+0xb80` IDLE: no save and no load owns the SL device.
pub const GAME_MAN_SAVE_STATE_IDLE: u32 = 0;

// ============================================================================
// `GameMan.saveState` IS A MUTEX, NOT A PROGRESS BAR -- and reading it as a progress bar is
// what killed saving after a Load Character reload in the first place.
//
// There is ONE SL device (the `FUN_140e6e060` singleton) and one `saveState` word arbitrating
// it. Every submit builder refuses unless it reads IDLE, and each stamps its own value on the
// way out (1.16.2, shift 0):
//
//   `FUN_14067b940` / `b750` / `b570` / `bc10`  save    -> saveState = 1, fills +0x10 and +0x20
//   `FUN_14067b4e0`                             preview -> saveState = 1, same two fields
//   `FUN_14067b1a0`                             load    -> saveState = 2, fills +0x18 and +0x20
//
// and `CS::MoveMapStep::DoSaveStuff` then picks EXACTLY ONE pump by that value: `IsSaveState1()`
// -> `FUN_140679510` (which polls `FUN_140e6e430`, the save side), else `IsSaveState2()` ->
// `FUN_140679180` (which polls `FUN_140e6e080`, the load side). The two are never both run.
//
// They are not interchangeable, and the load-side one is actively destructive against a save:
// `FUN_140e6e080` opens with `if (iodev+0x18 == 0 || iodev+0x20 == 0) return 4;` -- and +0x18 is
// the LOAD's buffer, so during a save it is 0 and the poll returns 4 having released NOTHING.
// `FUN_140679180` then writes `saveState = 0` for any answer that is not 0 or 1. That single
// write is the whole bug: `IsSaveState1()` goes false, `DoSaveStuff` stops polling the save,
// `FUN_140e6e430` -- the only save-side road to the release `FUN_140e6f200` -- is never called
// again, and +0x10/+0x20 stay latched for the life of the process. That is precisely the
// orphan the block above repairs, arriving with `saveState` already 0 exactly as measured.
//
// So these predicates exist to keep a caller from pumping a lane it does not own. They are pure
// and total for the same reason `save_request_is_orphaned` is: the decision guards a call into
// the engine that can cost the user every save they make afterwards.
