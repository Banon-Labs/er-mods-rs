// THE REST OF THE `saveState` WRITER SET -- the three writes `save_state_witness.rs` could not see,
// and the counter that says when the answer is "none of them".
//
// `include!`d into `lib.rs` like the blocks around it. `save_state_witness.rs` chains observers onto
// the two wrappers that were reachable when it was written; this file completes the set, using the
// SAME mechanism (a union-chained observer that samples `saveState` and the SL device either side of
// the call, forwards every argument and changes no return value). It adds no new kind of instrument.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. The 2026-08-31 wedge is not a stranded save: at the instant `saveState` went 1 -> 0
// the game's own poll `FUN_140e6e430` answered STATUS 1 on the latched request, and 250 ms later the
// same poll answered 0 and released the device. So the write landed WHILE the SL worker was still
// writing, and the two witnessed wrappers reported `abandoning_writes = 0` in the very run that
// wedged. The remaining writes had to be enumerated from the image rather than guessed at.
//
// THE COMPLETE WRITER SET, byte-scanned on BOTH images and paired (`mov [reg+0xb80], imm/reg`, every
// store form including the register one an immediate-only scan misses). 22 stores in each image,
// pairing EXACTLY at +0xE50 with no 1.17-only writer and none missing -- so the 1.17 game this branch
// targets has the same writers as the 1.16.2 decompiles below describe:
//
//   1.16.2      1.17        function                who can reach it                       witnessed

//
//   (*) `FUN_140677f40` writes `saveState = 0` unconditionally, but `CS::MoveMapStep::DoSaveStuff`
//       reaches it only through `IsSaveState7`, and the wedge forms out of `saveState == 1`, where
//       `DoSaveStuff` takes the `IsSaveState1` arm instead. The three arms are mutually exclusive
//       in one `if/else if/else`, so this is exclusion by the caller's own structure.
//
// THE ONE THAT IS NOT A POLL WRAPPER, and the reason this file is worth the hooks:
// `FUN_14067ac90` is `GameMan::SetSaveState(int)` -- 14 bytes, `MOV RAX,[0x143d69918];
// MOV [RAX+0xb80],ECX; RET`. It is the only store to the field that writes a REGISTER rather than an
// immediate, and its ONE caller in the whole image is `FUN_140aff640`, the per-frame in-map
// `MoveMapStep` tick, three statements after `DoSaveStuff` and `FUN_140afb880`:
//
//     MOVSS  XMM6,[RDI+0x8]            ; the frame delta
//     CALL   0x14067a080               ; IsSaveStateIdle()
//     TEST   AL,AL / JNZ  ...          ; idle -> skip
//     ADDSS  XMM6,[RBX+0x130]          ; accumulate, ONLY while a transaction owns the device
//     COMISS XMM6,[0x142b60870]        ; == 210.0f
//     MOVSS  [RBX+0x130],XMM6
//     JBE    ...
//     MOV    [RBX+0x130],ESI           ; acc = 0
//     CALL   0x14067ac90               ; SetSaveState(0)   <-- releases NOTHING
//
// That is a WATCHDOG: 210 seconds of continuously non-idle `saveState` and the field is forced to 0
// with the SL device untouched, which is the wedge signature exactly. The accumulator at
// `MoveMapStep+0x130` is zeroed only inside `FUN_140afb880`, which returns early at its own
// `IsSaveStateIdle` gate -- so nothing can reset it while a transaction is in flight and the deadline
// is unconditional once the clock starts.
//
// IT IS NOT THE 2026-08-31 WRITER, and saying so is the point of measuring rather than assuming: that
// run reached the world at +59230 ms and the wedge was first visible at +84123 ms, so at most ~25 s
// could have accumulated against a 210 s threshold. The hook is here because a writer nobody had
// named is worth an oracle whatever this run says, and because a run that DOES exceed 210 s (a long
// session, a stalled worker) has no other way to tell this apart from every other cause.
//
// AND THE COUNTER THAT MAKES A NEGATIVE WORTH SOMETHING. With these three the witnessed set covers
// every store in the image that can take `saveState` off 1. `writer_state_exits` counts, across ALL
// witnessed sites, the calls that observed `saveState` leave `SAVE_OWNS` -- device irrelevant, so it
// cannot be argued away by the device sample. If a wedge is born with that count at zero and the
// sites installed, the write did not come through any of them, and the next thing to doubt is the
// model (the field, the singleton, our own writers) rather than another arm of another poll.
