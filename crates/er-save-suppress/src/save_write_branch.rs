// WHICH WRITE BRANCH RAN.
//
// `include!`d into `lib.rs` (same module, same imports) like `save_job_completion.rs`.
//
// `SaveLoad2::SLSaveSession`'s job body `FUN_14240fd70` has TWO mutually exclusive write
// paths, and until these two counters existed nothing in the process could say which one a
// save took. Every claim about the steady state -- that a save over an existing container
// patches blocks in place and never rebuilds -- was read out of the decompile, not measured.
// These observers measure it.
//
// The choice is made INSIDE `FUN_14240fd70` (the `if`/`else` is its own), on the result code
// of a THIRD, separate call, `FUN_142413230` @line 114 of the decompile:
//
//   uVar4 = FUN_142413230(job+0x280, session, path);  // probe: is in-place viable?
//   FUN_14240dbf0(job, uVar4);                        // publish into job+0x9c
//   iVar5 = FUN_14240d8d0(job);                       // read it back out
//   if (iVar5 == 0) { FUN_142413860(job+0x281, ..) }  // -> FULL REBUILD
//   else            { FUN_1424142b0(job+0x282, ..);   // -> per-block IN-PLACE,
//                     FUN_1424142e0(job+0x283, ..) }  //    once per supplied block
//
// `FUN_142413230` mounts the container ALREADY ON DISK at the save path and walks every
// block the request supplies, testing `entry.size + entry.padding >= needed`. It returns `6`
// when the mount succeeded AND every block still fits, and `0` when the mount failed or any
// block outgrew its entry. Note that polarity is the INVERSE of the writers' own convention
// (both writers return 0 = success, 6 = failure), which is exactly why the branch reads like
// it selects the rebuild on success. It does not: 0 from the probe means "in-place is not
// viable", and the rebuild is the fallback.
//
// The probe mounts the ORIGINAL save path, so this decision does not depend on where the
// bytes eventually land -- a write-open redirect diverts the writers, not the probe. That
// part is CODE-DERIVED, not measured; these counters are the first instrument that can begin
// to test it.
//
// Both are pure observers: forward, count, return the callee's value unchanged.
