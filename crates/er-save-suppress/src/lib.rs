//! Save-write suppression: swallow the SL submit, report the save as succeeded.
//!
//! # What this does, in one sentence
//!
//! It stops ELDEN RING from ever *enqueueing* a save-write job, and then answers the
//! game's own "did my save finish?" question with the code that means SUCCESS -- so no
//! byte is ever written, no backup is copied or deleted, and every native observer of
//! the save lifecycle sees exactly the state a real successful save leaves behind.
//!
//! # Shared core, one host DLL per process
//!
//! This crate is the suppression core linked by BOTH the standalone
//! `er-save-disable` (census/proof DLL) and the product `er-quickload` cdylib
//! (save-game-flow WP1). The host DLL wires the seams before `install`:
//!
//! - [`set_log_sink`]: where human-readable lines go (the standalone's
//!   `er-save-disable.log`, the product's autoload debug log).
//! - [`set_publish_sink`]: called on the telemetry-publish schedule (install,
//!   first-of-each-counter, milestones, every failure path). The standalone wires its
//!   census snapshot writer through the witness reentrancy guard; the product wires a
//!   no-op because its periodic telemetry writer exports the counters on its own cadence.
//!
//! NEVER load `er_save_disable.dll` alongside `er_quickload.dll` in one me3 profile:
//! each carries its own MinHook instance and both would detour `0x140e6fb50` /
//! `0x140e6e430`, corrupting each other's trampolines.
//!
//! # The one-shot bypass (save-game-flow WP1)
//!
//! With suppression global, the product needs exactly one sanctioned writer: the
//! System->Quit "Save Game" row. [`arm_one_save_bypass`] arms a single-use token; the
//! next SL save enqueue consumes it and is forwarded to the real trampoline (real
//! submit, real write). Everything else keeps being swallowed.
//!
//! That bypassed save then has to be OBSERVED to completion, and there are three ways it
//! can end, all of them funnelled into the one latch [`take_bypass_final_status`] reads:
//!
//!   * the SL worker's job body returns -- [`adopt_completed_save_job_as_final_status`],
//!     the signal that needs nobody to poll and therefore always exists;
//!   * a native poll consumer answers first (`DoSaveStuff` / the "saving..." MenuJob);
//!   * the native enqueue refuses the submit, which is terminal on the spot.
//!
//! [`bypass_final_status_source`] says which of them it was, so a commit that only ended
//! because the caller's watchdog expired stays distinguishable from one that was observed.
//!
//! # Why this layer and not another (1.16.2, all addresses byte-verified)
//!
//! Every save in the game is request-based and asynchronous. A trigger sets
//! `GameMan+0xb72`/`+0xb73`; a per-frame dispatcher serializes the data and hands it to
//! the platform save-IO device ("SL"); an SL worker thread later opens the file and
//! writes it. The whole write side funnels through a single call:
//!
//! ```text
//!   FUN_14067b750 (game save)     -> FUN_140e6ec70 -+
//!   FUN_14067b940 (game+system)   -> FUN_140e6ef60  |
//!   FUN_14067b570 (system only)   -> FUN_140e6ec70  +-> FUN_140e6fb50 -> FUN_14240ae10
//!   FUN_14067b4e0 (all blocks)    -> FUN_140e6ec80  |      (enqueue)      -> FUN_14240e6f0
//!   FUN_140e6e430 (deferred)      -> FUN_140e6f370 -+                        (worker queue)
//! ```
//!
//! `FUN_140e6fb50` has exactly five callers image-wide (the five above) and is the
//! *only* caller of `FUN_14240ae10`, which is in turn the only caller of the write
//! enqueue `FUN_14240e6f0`. So `FUN_140e6fb50` is not "a good place to intercept" --
//! it is the unique, provable choke point for every save write the game can perform,
//! including the boot-time system-slot save that no trigger-level hook would have seen.
//!
//! It is also strictly *above* the thread hand-off: `CopyFileW` of `ER0000.sl2.bak`
//! (`FUN_142410830`), the `.bak` delete, the BND4 rebuild (`FUN_142413860`), the
//! per-block writes (`FUN_1424142e0`) and `SetEndOfFile` all live inside the job body
//! `FUN_14240fd70`, which only ever runs after a successful enqueue. Swallowing the
//! enqueue therefore removes 100% of the save file IO, not just the payload write.
//!
//! # Why loads are untouched
//!
//! The SL device keeps *save* state in `iodev+0x10` (an `SLSaveContent`) and *load*
//! state in `iodev+0x18` (a distinct 0x230-byte content object). Loads submit through
//! `FUN_140e6eb80` -> `FUN_14240ad30` -> `FUN_14240e420` -- a different enqueue with a
//! different job class, reached from `FUN_14067b200` (slot load), `FUN_14067b1a0`,
//! `FUN_14067b480` and `FUN_140829f30`. None of them touches `FUN_140e6fb50`. Continue
//! and Load Game read the real save file exactly as they always did.
//!
//! # Why the status lie cannot corrupt anything
//!
//! `FUN_140e6e430` (the save status poll) returns the literal `4` from exactly one
//! place: an early-out taken when `iodev+0x10 == 0`, i.e. when *no save request object
//! exists at all*. Every other return path goes through the job-state jump table and
//! can only produce 0,1,2,7,8,9. So the detour calls the original first and only
//! rewrites a `4`. A `4` observed by the original is proof that there is no in-flight
//! save to lie about -- the guard is structural, not a heuristic, and needs no struct
//! offsets, no game-state reads and no timing window.
//!
//! Natively a `4` means "nothing was submitted", which `DoSaveStuff` maps to a silent
//! no-op that never advances `GameMan+0xbc4` -- and the System->Quit menu chain
//! *spins forever waiting for `bc4 == 3`*. Rewriting it to `0` is what closes that
//! deadlock: `0` is the full-success arm.
//!
//! # What the status lie can and cannot do (a hypothesis this file had to kill)
//!
//! It is tempting to blame a Save Game that never wrote on the lie -- "we told the game a
//! save is in progress, so it declined to start another". The decompile rules that out.
//! The lie only ever rewrites `4` (no request) to `0` (SUCCESS); it never produces `1`
//! (in flight). The gate that decides whether a new save may be dispatched is
//! `FUN_14067a080`, which is exactly `GameMan.saveState == 0` -- and the only writers of
//! `saveState` on the poll path, `FUN_140679510` and `FUN_1406794b0`, set it to **0**
//! whenever the status is not `1`. So the lie can only ever OPEN that gate, never close
//! it. When a fired request sits latched with `saveState == 0` and no submit appears, the
//! refusal is downstream of the gate and upstream of the enqueue -- see the save-dispatch
//! observers below, which exist to name which link it was.
//!
//! # The state a swallowed save leaves behind
//!
//! Because the detour returns "submitted OK", the dispatcher runs its real commit tail:
//! `b72 = 0`, `b73 = 0`, `b80 = 1`, `bb8 = 1`, `bbc` bumped, `bc4 1 -> 2`. The next
//! frame `FUN_140679510` polls, gets our `0`, retires `b80 -> 0`, consumes `bb8`,
//! increments `bc0`; `DoSaveStuff` takes case 0 and calls `FUN_14067a980`, which moves
//! `bc4 2 -> 3` and sets the `0x143b355c8` "save concluded" latch. The finalize case-7
//! gate then passes on its own (`b80 == 0`, `!ShouldSave()`, `!FUN_140679370()`), the
//! "saving..." MenuJob reads `0` and reports Success, and the autosave spinner retires
//! within one `CSFeManImp::Update`. No field is forged and no state is poked.

// THE SL REQUEST SLOT. The one set of numbers that decides whether a save that never

// which operand.
//
// `FUN_140e6ef60` -- the submit builder the COMBINED lane `FUN_14067b940` calls -- opens
// with a single conjunction (1.16.2 decompile, shift 0):
//
// ```text
//   if (iodev+0x10 == 0 && iodev+0x20 == 0 && buf != 0 && tail != 0
//       && slot < 10 && kind == 10) { ...build... }
//   return 0;                                   // AL = 0: "no submit"
// ```
//
// Its ONLY caller passes `FUN_140e6ef60(FUN_140e6e060(), pvVar4, param_1, buffer, 10, ..)`
// and has already proven four of those six operands:
//
//   * `buf`  (`pvVar4`, the 0x280000 MainHeap block) -- `if (pvVar4 == 0) return 0;`
//   * `tail` (`buffer`, the 0x60000 block)           -- `if (buffer == 0) return 0;`
//   * `slot` (`param_1`)                             -- `if (9 < param_1 || CanShowSaveMenu())`
//                                                       diverts to the system-only lane,
//                                                       so the builder only ever sees < 10
//   * `kind`                                         -- the literal 10 at the call site
//
// So when that lane declines AFTER a successful serialization, the guard can only have
// failed on `iodev+0x10` or `iodev+0x20`. There is no third possibility, and the two are
// different bugs. `FUN_140e6ec70` (the char-only and system-only lanes' builder) gates on
// the same two fields plus `buf != 0`.
//
// The remaining non-guard exit is the `HeapAlloc(0x298)`/`SLSaveContent::SLSaveContent`
// pair; it stores its result into `iodev+0x10` before testing it, so a failure there
// leaves the slot CLEAR and is distinguishable from a guard bail by exactly this sample.
//
// WHY BOTH FIELDS AND NOT JUST `+0x10`: `iodev+0x20` is a SHARED job slot. The LOAD
// builders `FUN_140e6f430`/`FUN_140e6f5b0` write `param_1[4]`, which is `iodev+0x20`, and
// gate on `iodev+0x18 == 0 && iodev+0x20 == 0`. A load that completed but was never
// consumed therefore blocks every subsequent save through the same conjunction -- and
// `FUN_140e6e080` case 0x14 deliberately does NOT release on a successful load, deferring
// that to the consumer `FUN_14067b100` -> `FUN_140e6e380` -> `FUN_140e6f200`. Sampling
// `+0x18` alongside `+0x20` separates "a stale save request" from "a stale load request",
// which the guard itself cannot.
// ============================================================================

// THE LOAD CONSUMER. The other half of the shared `iodev+0x20` job slot, and the reason a
// save can be refused forever by something that is not a save at all.
//
// A completed LOAD is NOT released where it completes. `FUN_140e6e080` case 0x14 with a
// zero `param_2` reads the job's result, finds success, and returns 0 having called
// nothing -- deliberately, because the payload has not been handed to anyone yet. The
// release is owed by the CONSUMER:
//
// ```text
//   FUN_14067b100(out_buf, size)          // gate: saveState == 3 && GameMan+0xdf0 == 0
//     -> FUN_140e6e380(iodev, out, size)  // gate: +0x18 && +0x20 && result==0 && state==0x14
//          memcpy(out, content, n)
//          FUN_140e6f200(iodev)           // <-- the release, and its ONLY unconditional site
// ```
//
// So the load's job survives exactly as long as its consumer is not run. And the submit
// builders gate on `iodev+0x10 == 0 && iodev+0x20 == 0`, which the surviving job fails --
// permanently, for every save in the process. That is the shape of a save refusal whose
// cause is a load: [`SL_BAIL_LOAD_JOB_LATCHED`].
//

// The helpers below let such a substitution PROVE that the debt was paid, by sampling the

// do not release anything themselves: releasing from here would mean re-deriving the
// native guard (`FUN_14240a180`/`FUN_14240a1f0` on the job) in our own code, and a guard

// SAVE-DISPATCH OBSERVERS. Pure observation of the three native save-dispatch lanes and
// the character serializer that gates two of them. They change nothing; they exist so a
// save that never reaches the enqueue can be attributed in ONE run instead of three.
//
// Why they are needed (1.16.2 decompile, `FUN_140aff640` = MoveMapStep step 18, the
// steady in-world step -- its step-table entry sits at MoveMapStep+0x378, and the table
// base 0xa8 with 0x28-byte entries puts that at index 18, the `STEP_MoveMap` index this
// repo already tracks; the array ends at +0x4b8, which the same function reads):
//
//   FUN_140aff640 (every in-world frame)
//     -> DoSaveStuff              polls the SL status while GameMan.saveState == 1
//     -> FUN_140afb880            the save DISPATCHER
//          gate: !BOOL_143d856a0, (ShouldSave() || b73 || slotLoad != -1),
//                and FUN_14067a080() == (GameMan.saveState == 0)
//          lane: b72 && b73 -> FUN_14067b940   (combined: char slot + system)
//                b72        -> FUN_14067b750   (char slot only)
//                       b73 -> FUN_14067b570   (system only)
//
// The two CHARACTER lanes only build a submit when `FUN_14067dc00` (the character
// serializer) returns non-zero:
//
//   cVar2 = FUN_14067dc00(GameMan, buf, 0x280000, 0);
//   ...
//   if (cVar2 != '\0') { cVar3 = FUN_140e6ef60(iodev, buf, slot, ...); }   // -> the enqueue
//   if (cVar3 != '\0') { bc4 1->2; bb8 = 1; saveState = 1; b72 = b73 = 0; }
//
// So a serializer that returns 0 makes the lane return 0 having touched NOTHING: b72/b73
// stay set, saveState stays 0, the dispatcher re-enters next frame, and no SL enqueue is
// ever created. From the outside that is indistinguishable from "the dispatcher never
// ran" -- and both look identical to a one-shot bypass token, which simply expires.
// These observers make the three cases distinguishable.
//
// The serializer's own first gate is
//   `buf == 0 || GameMan+0xcb1 != 0 || GameMan+0xcb2 != 0 || [0x143d68078] == 0`
// and it is the ONE exit that returns without writing the byte counter `_DAT_143d69920`.
// That gate is PROVEN UNREACHABLE in this scenario, so the byte counter is written on
// every exit we can actually observe -- see `SAVE_SERIALIZE_BYTES_RVA` for the proof and
// `serialize_fail_step_label` for the decode.
