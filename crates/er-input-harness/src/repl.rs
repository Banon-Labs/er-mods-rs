//! A live command loop, so exploring the running game stops costing a relaunch.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Every structural question about the menu so far has cost a full launch: edit the DLL, rebuild,
//! tear the session down, boot for a minute, read one line of log, repeat. That is the wrong unit of
//! work for exploration, and it is why a single wrong offset (`pause_menu_grid` deriving a vtable
//! from a window that is not up yet) burned four launches before its own log line said so.
//!
//! # Why not Frida
//!
//! Frida would give read and call in one attach, which is exactly the shape wanted here. It is not
//! usable on this target: `frida.attach()` on the Wine/Proton `eldenring.exe` injects a bootstrapper
//! that segfaults inside the game -- "bootstrapper crashed with signal 11", process gone, measured
//! 2026-08-12 on a live session that was being held open. Attaching at spawn is a different code
//! path and might survive, but me3 owns the spawn: it launches the exe and injects the mod host, so
//! there is no point at which frida could own the process first without displacing the loader the
//! whole product depends on.
//!
//! This module gets the same capability from the other end. The harness is already in the process
//! from `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH` -- attached at the beginning, by construction, which is the condition
//! frida needs and cannot have here. It runs on the game thread, so it can read anything and (once
//! the command set grows) call anything, with no injection and nothing to crash.
//!
//! # Protocol
//!
//! `er-harness-cmd.txt` (env override `ER_HARNESS_CMD_PATH`) holds:
//!
//! ```text
//! <sequence number>
//! <command>
//! ```
//!
//! The sequence number is what makes the file a queue rather than a repeating instruction: the
//! command runs when the number changes, so rewriting the file with the same number is inert and a
//! command cannot fire twice because a frame happened to re-read it. Results go to the harness log,
//! which is already redirected per-run.
//!
//! Commands are read-only by design. Exploration must not be able to break the session it is
//! exploring -- that is the property that makes "try again" cheap, and the reason a `call` verb is
//! not here yet rather than being added speculatively.
//!
//! ```text
//! scan <hex-qword> [max-hits]   every address in committed memory holding that qword
//! read <hex-addr> [n-qwords]    dump n qwords from an address
//! grid                          every CS::GridControl instance, with its selected cell
//! picker                        the save-file picker's own cursor, named rather than guessed
//! point <x> <y>                 move the menu pointer there, then report every grid's cell
//! release                       stop authoring the pointer; the game sees the real mouse again
//! sweep [x0 y0 x1 y1 nx ny]     walk a grid of coordinates and report every hovered-cell CHANGE
//! key <dik> [polls]            hold a DirectInput scancode for N polls, then release
//! click [polls]                hold the left mouse button for N polls, then release
//! vk <code> [polls]            hold a Win32 VIRTUAL KEY -- the channel a text field reads
//! type <text>                  type an ASCII string one character per poll (SHIFT handled)
//! backspace <n>                send N backspaces, one per poll
//! pad <id> [polls]             hold one FD4 pad virtual-key id (1000..1080), then release
//! padsweep [lo] [hi]           hold each pad id in turn, reporting every picker-cursor change
//! force <code> [polls]         answer the game's own menu-code query "pressed" for N polls
//! qstats                       which menu-query candidate is live, and what codes it polls
//! openmenu                     native request for the IngameTop pause menu (CSPopupMenu+0x121)
//! optionsetting                native submit of the System pause row's MenuJob, opening
//!                              02_040_OptionSetting on tab 0 (needs the pause menu already up)
//! ```
//!
//! `openmenu` and `optionsetting` are the two verbs that are not read-only, and they are here
//! because this build's menus do not take injected input. Measured 2026-09-12 on a live session:
//! `openmenu` opened the pause menu in one frame, while `key 0x1`, `key 0xc8`, `key 0x12` and
//! `force 0x2d` all reported delivered and left the pause `CS::GridControl` at `selected_cell=0`.
//! Both verbs go through the game's own job factory and submit path rather than writing menu state,
//! so what they do is what the row does.
//!
//! `sweep` is the verb that makes the others usable. Hunting a row by trying coordinates by hand
//! costs one command and one poll per guess, and a menu that answers cell 0 everywhere is
//! indistinguishable from a pointer that is not landing at all. So the sweep drives itself: it
//! holds one coordinate per poll -- the game needs a frame to hit-test, which is exactly why this
//! cannot be a loop inside a single command -- and logs only the coordinates where a hovered cell
//! changed. The output is therefore a coordinate-to-row map, and after one sweep a row is addressed
//! by index rather than searched for.
//!
//! ```text
//! ```
//!
//! `point` is the one verb that writes, and it writes the field a real mouse writes -- the pause
//! menu is a hit-test of that coordinate pair (proven by watching a user nudge move exactly one
//! GridControl's `+0xd4` while every other one held still). Pairing the write with the resulting
//! cell in a single command is what makes navigation WATCHED: the row is read back before anything
//! is confirmed, and on the Quit tab one row off is *Return to Desktop*.
