//! er-input-harness -- standalone Elden Ring INPUT SELF-DRIVE HARNESS.
//!
//! A separate cdylib (`er_input_harness.dll`), loaded as its own `[[natives]]` entry in the ME3
//! profile ALONGSIDE the product (or with the telemetry-only DLL for a vanilla capture). Its mere
//! PRESENCE enables it (DEFAULT-ON, no env/marker gate); omit it from the profile for production.
//!
//! MECHANISM: ER input is driven by writing the game's OWN input memory -- the CSMenuMan keystate
//! bitmap (`inputmgr+0x90+eventId`), the DLUID input-active flag (`+0x88d`), and the title global
//! accept byte (`base+0x4589bdc`) -- on the GAME THREAD each frame. SendInput/XInput/window-focus was a
//! DEAD path and is not carried over.
//!
//! TITLE-ACTIVE HOOK (2026-07-22): the per-frame callback is a `CSTaskImp` `FrameBegin` recurring task
//! (same registration as er-telemetry), which fires at the TITLE and boot screens AND in-world --
//! unlike the previous in-world-only union MinHook anchor, which never ran at the title and so could not
//! drive PRESS ANY BUTTON / Continue. This lets the harness drive the FULL native boot+reload standalone
//! (bd USER-chose-build-harness-title-drive-cstaskimp-hook-accept-byte-2026-07-22).
//!
//! CROSS-DLL STATE: separate DLLs do not share Rust statics, so this DLL re-derives menu/game state by
//! reading GAME memory directly (game_mem) instead of reading product statics.

// A cdylib whose every consumer is `DllMain` and the per-frame game task it registers, all of
// them `#[cfg(windows)]`. On a host build the shell is compiled with its only callers cfg'd out,
// so `dead_code`/`unused_imports` there report the cfg, not real debt (measured 2026-08-21: 108
// on the host, 0 on the shipping target). The SHIPPING target carries the full deny.
