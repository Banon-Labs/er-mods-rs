//! Zero-dependency Win32 FFI surface for the input-harness DLL.
//!
//! Mirrors the raw-`extern`/`#[link]` style of `er-reload-trace` (no `windows`-crate
//! dependency, so nothing extra crosses the cargo-xwin cross-compile boundary). Only the calls the
//! DIRECT-input-memory self-drive uses are declared: module resolution (find the game image),
//! timing/log helpers, and `ReadProcessMemory` for fault-safe
//! game-memory reads. There is deliberately NO `SendInput`/`XInput`/window-focus surface: those were
//! the dead path (user, 2026-07-19) -- ER menu/gameplay input is driven by writing the game's own
//! input memory (CSMenuMan keystate bitmap + DLUID input-active flag), never synthesized OS input.
