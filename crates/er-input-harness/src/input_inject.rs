//! Direct in-process input injection -- the verified ER input lever (user-confirmed 2026-07-19; the
//! SendInput/XInput/window-focus path was a dead end). No OS input is synthesized: the game's own
//! input memory is written on the game thread each frame.
//!
//! Two writes, both ported verbatim from the product with their exact reverse-engineered addresses:
//!
//!  1. Menu events -- the front-end/menu reads a KEYSTATE BITMAP at `inputmgr+0x90+eventId`, edge-
//!     triggered (`&1`). `inputmgr = *(base + 0x3d6b7b0)` (CSMenuMan / SelectBot input manager). Tap
//!     an event by or-ing bit0 into `inputmgr+0x90+eventId`; the bitmap is re-polled every frame, so
//!     assert for a couple frames then gap for a clean single edge (no auto-repeat). Verified event
//!     ids (RE 2026-06-17, `frontend-menu-input-injection-ids-2026`): vertical-move = 0x00 and 0x45
//!     (inject both; only Down advances, Up saturates), Confirm/OK = 0x3d. Mirrors the product's
//!     `menu_input_probe` (crates/er-quickload/src/experiments/continue_load/product_continue.rs).
//!
//!  2. Stay-active (unfocused input) -- ER clears `[DLUID+0x88d]` every frame it is not
//!     `GetActiveWindow`; re-setting it to 1 lets the injected input apply while the window is
//!     UNFOCUSED (bd `breakthrough-pad-boundary-injection-moves-char-needs-focus`). `DLUID =
//!     *(base + 0x485dc18)` (input-device manager). This is why the direct path needs no window focus.
//!
//! Both writes are guarded by a fault-safe readability probe first, so a not-yet-initialized singleton
//! pointer can never fault the game thread.
