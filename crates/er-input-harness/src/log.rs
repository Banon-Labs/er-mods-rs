//! Fresh-per-run debug log, modeled on `er-reload-trace`'s log helper. The harness leaves a
//! diagnosable evidence trail (default runtime research mode is telemetry/non-fatal per AGENTS.md)
//! without a `bd` memory or a screenshot -- those are separate oracles.
//!
//! Both files describe exactly ONE process run: `er_game_base::log` truncates each on this
//! process's first write to it (rotating the previous run's aside as `.prev`), which is what makes
//! a count over `er-input-harness-phases.jsonl` a count for THIS run.
