//! Answer the game's own menu-code query, instead of writing an input device by hand.
//!
//! # Why this layer and not another device write
//!
//! `CS::GridControl`'s pager (vtable slot 2) never touches a pad device directly. Every direction it
//! tests goes through `FUN_14075d970` (1.16.2), which gates on a predicate and then invokes a lambda
//! carrying a menu code at `+0x08` and a mode byte at `+0x0c`; the lambda asks the input provider at
//! `*(CSEzMenuViewerPad+0x10)`, vtable `+0x28`, whether that code is pressed. So "press list-down" is
//! not a byte in an array -- it is this function returning non-zero for code `0x2c`.
//!
//! Everything else has been measured dead against the save-file picker, which is why this is the
//! remaining channel rather than the first guess:
//!
//! | channel | result |
//! |---|---|
//! | keyboard `Down`/`S`/`Tab` | `ProfileLoadDialog` byte-identical across the press |
//! | binding table | list up/down are codes `0x2c`/`0x2d` with `kb=0xffffffff` -- unbound by design |
//! | mouse, 36-point sweep | no transition on any live `GridControl` |
//! | `padDevices[dev]+0x88` | inert: the menu's device is resolved through `padMaps`, not `padDevices` |
//! | the menu's own device | crashed the game -- that object is live-owned, not a scratch array |
//!
//! Answering the query is also the only one of those that does not fabricate state the game did not
//! ask for: the game asks a question every frame, and this returns a different answer for exactly one
//! code, for exactly as long as a press should last.
//!
//! # Two hooks, because the address is genuinely ambiguous
//!
//! Mapping 1.16.2 `0x14075d970` to 1.17 yields two candidates with the same prologue and near-equal
//! bodies (`0x14075e7c0` at 179/192 bytes identical, `0x14075e880` at 177/192). Byte scoring cannot
//! separate near-identical siblings, and picking the higher score would be a guess dressed as a
//! measurement. Both are hooked; each logs its own hit count and the codes it is asked about, so one
//! run says which one the picker actually drives -- and the wrong one simply never fires.
