//! WHICH keys drive the effect selector, read from `er-net-effects.toml` and re-read while the
//! game runs.
//!
//! # Why these stopped being constants
//!
//! Every key here was a `VK_*` constant with no config line: the four arrows, numpad `+`/`-`,
//! `Alt+'`, and the three show/hide chords. Two of those choices are actively contested --
//! the arrows are the game's own menu and quick-item keys, and `Alt+Insert` is a key another mod
//! in the same me3 profile may well have taken. A player who did not want this DLL eating their
//! arrows had exactly one remedy: unload it.
//!
//! # The two things a rebind must get right
//!
//! **The DirectInput edge mask must be reset.** `input_suppression` remembers which selector keys
//! were down on the previous poll as a bitmask, and the bits are positional -- slot 3 is
//! "cursor right" only while the bindings that produced them are still in force. Carry that mask
//! across a rebind and a key held at that instant either swallows its own press or manufactures
//! one. The [`slot`] indices are therefore fixed, and the caller clears the mask whenever
//! [`refresh_live`] reports [`BindingsUpdate::moved`].
//!
//! **A malformed value must keep the key that was working.** `er_hotkey_config::Binding` owns that
//! rule; this module supplies the parse and the log line.
//!
//! # Alt is a REQUIREMENT, never a filter
//!
//! A chord with Alt fires only while Alt is held. A chord WITHOUT Alt fires whether or not it is
//! -- which is what the hard-coded table did, and it matters: holding Alt while arrowing through
//! the list must keep moving the cursor. Getting this backwards would make the arrows deaf
//! whenever the player happened to rest a thumb on Alt.

// Windows-only in practice; kept portable so `cargo test` proves the binding table on the host
// instead of it being reasoned about in a review.
