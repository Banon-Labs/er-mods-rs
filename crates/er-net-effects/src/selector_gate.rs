//! WHEN the effect selector may take the keyboard, and WHICH keys it may take.
//!
//! # The bug this exists to kill
//!
//! Elden Ring reads the keyboard through `IDirectInputDevice8::GetDeviceState` (vtable slot 9,
//! detoured with MinHook in [`crate::input_suppression`]). While the selector claims the keyboard
//! this DLL blanks the four arrow DIK bytes -- `DIK_LEFT 0xcb`, `DIK_RIGHT 0xcd`, `DIK_UP 0xc8`,
//! `DIK_DOWN 0xd0` -- out of that 256-byte table before the game reads it, and separately returns
//! `LRESULT(1)` for arrow key-down/key-up from a `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook. Both are hard takings: the
//! game never learns the key was pressed.
//!
//! What armed them was `NetEffectsState::effect_selector_visible`, which is seeded from the
//! `overlay_visible_on_start` config key and DEFAULTS TO TRUE. That flag does not mean "the
//! selector list is on screen". The bar is drawn by hudhook and starts COLLAPSED
//! (`present_overlay::START_COLLAPSED`), so a default install shows a two-word `ER NET EFFECTS [+]`
//! header and no effect list at all -- while blanking the player's arrow keys out of every
//! DirectInput read. Worse, the DirectInput blanking consulted no runtime gate whatsoever, so it
//! was in force at the title screen and in every menu, where the arrow keys are how you navigate.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! Open means the selector is genuinely on screen and able to act: the player has not hidden the
//! bar, the bar is not minimized to its button, and the DLL's own runtime gate says there is a
//! live player.
//!
//! TAKING and ACTING are separate questions, and conflating them is what made the first version of
//! this gate wrong in the other direction.
//!
//! **Taking** is the narrow one: only the four arrows, only while open. A key taken from the game
//! is a key the player pressed and the game never saw, so nothing else is ever taken -- every
//! other key the selector reads is passed straight through.
//!
//! **Acting** splits by what the key does:
//!
//! - Keys that drive the ON-SCREEN CURSOR -- [`SelectorKey::Arrow`] and [`SelectorKey::StackEdit`]
//!   -- require open. A cursor nobody can see is not a thing to drive, and numpad `+` on an
//!   invisible highlight would stack an effect the player never chose and rewrite
//!   `er-net-effects.toml` to match.
//! - Deliberate chords and player-chosen bindings stay live whether the bar is open or not:
//!   [`SelectorKey::ShowHide`] (the only way back to a hidden bar),
//!   [`SelectorKey::ExpandCollapse`] (the only way OPEN -- see below),
//!   [`SelectorKey::EffectToggle`], and [`SelectorKey::Other`] -- which is where the hotkeys from
//!   `.er-net-effects-hotkeys.json` land. Firing an effect while the bar is minimized IS this
//!   DLL's primary use; the bar ships minimized precisely so it can be played that way. Gating
//!   those on open would make the DLL useless for the thing it is for.
//!
//! None of them can be taken from the game in the first place: they need Alt, and Elden Ring binds
//! nothing to Alt+0, Alt+9 or Alt+'.
//!
//! # Why expanding needs a KEY, not just the button
//!
//! The `[+]` header is a mouse target at absolute screen coordinates, hit-tested against
//! `imgui::Io::mouse_pos`, which hudhook fills from `WM_MOUSEMOVE` / `WM_INPUT` on the game's
//! window. From #317 until 2026-08-31 that click was the ONLY thing that could expand the bar,
//! and it never once fired.
//!
//! WHAT WAS MEASURED, live, run `br-20260831-063324-0a97`, `/proc/<pid>/mem` (no injection):
//!
//! - `overlay_toggle_clicks` finished the ~8-hour session at **0** across 1,296,264 rendered
//!   frames. The button was drawn on every one of them.
//! - The wndproc path itself WORKS -- `MouseClickedPos[0]` held `(2155, 821)`, so imgui had seen
//!   real positions and a real left click at some point. This was not a dead hook.
//! - `MousePos` was nevertheless FROZEN at `(3190, 794)` on a 3840x2160 display across 12s of
//!   sampling while the game rendered at ~45fps -- far from the button's corner box, which sits
//!   within `SCREEN_MARGIN` of the top right.
//!
//! WHAT IS INFERRED, not proven: that the freeze is Elden Ring holding the mouse for the camera
//! through DirectInput and leaving the Windows cursor where it lies. It fits (the game polls a
//! DirectInput device every frame, and the cursor is hidden in play), but a still pointer is also
//! what a player who is not touching the mouse produces, and that was not separable from a read.
//!
//! Either way the conclusion is the same and does not rest on the mechanism: a hit box in a screen
//! corner is the wrong affordance on a host that may own the pointer, and a feature with exactly
//! one affordance that scores zero in 1.3M frames needs a second one. The click stays -- it works
//! wherever the pointer IS free -- and the key is what the player uses.

// Windows-only in practice; kept portable so `cargo test` proves the decision table on the host
// instead of it being reasoned about in a review.
