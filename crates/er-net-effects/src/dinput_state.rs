//! Which `IDirectInputDevice8::GetDeviceState` calls are KEYBOARD reads.
//!
//! THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO KILL. Every DirectInput device of a class shares one vtable, so hooking
//! the keyboard's `GetDeviceState` slot also intercepts the mouse when both resolve to the same
//! implementation -- the install path already detects that case. A mouse read hands the hook a
//! 16-byte `DIMOUSESTATE`, and reading DIK offsets out of it finds nothing, so the arrow keys all
//! look RELEASED. That wipes the held-key mask, and the next genuine keyboard read -- same frame,
//! key still physically down -- looks like a brand new press.
//!
//! The result is one queued step per interleaved poll for as long as the key is held: the
//! selector runs away and a single tap cannot be delivered reliably. It also silently disables
//! hold-repeat, because a key that re-presses every poll never survives long enough to latch.
//! Measured on run br-20260816-225144-95cb: 139 queued selector keys, 0 of them repeats.
//!
//! Sizes are the discriminator, and they are unambiguous: a keyboard state is the 256-byte DIK
//! table and nothing else is 256 bytes.

// Windows-only in practice; kept portable so the sizes below are asserted by `cargo test` on the
// host instead of being trusted from memory.
