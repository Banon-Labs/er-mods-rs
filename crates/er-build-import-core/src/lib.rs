//! Import an Elden Ring build from an `er-build-planner` share link.
//!
//! The planner's `?b=<id>` links are not encoded payloads -- they are ids for
//! builds stored server-side, fetched with a single unauthenticated
//! `GET https://er-inventory-api.nyasu.business/inventories/<id>`. The response
//! identifies every item by **display name**, so importing a build is two
//! problems: parsing the document ([`model`]) and resolving those names to item
//! ids ([`catalog`]) before computing what to grant ([`plan`]).
//!
//! This crate is deliberately host-buildable and free of game and network
//! dependencies, so the whole mapping is provable with `cargo test`.
//!
//! ```
//! use er_build_import_core::{catalog::{entry, Kind, MapCatalog}, model, plan::plan};
//!
//! let doc = model::parse(r#"{
//!     "name": "example", "weaponUpgrade": 25,
//!     "inventory": {"slots": [{"name": "Misericorde", "infusion": "Occult"}]}
//! }"#).expect("valid build document");
//!
//! let catalog = MapCatalog::new().with(Kind::Weapon, "Misericorde", entry(1_070_000));
//! let result = plan(&doc, &catalog);
