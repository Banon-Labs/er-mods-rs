//! Turning a parsed build into concrete item grants.
//!
//! # The grant record
//!
//! The layout below is not invented here: it is the record the community's
//! long-standing `ItemGib` routine consumes, recovered from the planner's own
//! Cheat Engine exporter (`yF`), which emits per item
//! `dd <id+upgrade> <quantity> <reinforceLv:16><0:16> <weaponSkill>` and
//! terminates the array with `00000000 00000000 00000000 FFFFFFFF`.
//!
//! Three details are easy to get wrong and are pinned by tests:
//!
//! 1. The affinity is an **offset added into the item id** (`Occult` = +1200),
//!    not an index and not a separate field.
//! 2. The upgrade level goes in **both** places, exactly as the record above spells
//!    it: folded into the id (`<id+upgrade>`) AND passed as the separate 16-bit
//!    `reinforceLv`. The id is the half that is actually read back -- see
//!    [`armament_item_id`] for the measurement. `EquipParamWeapon::GetEntry`
//!    normalises to `(paramId / 100) * 100` because the last two digits are the
//!    LEVEL, not because they are noise; setting only `CSWepGaitemIns::reinforcement`
//!    yields a `+0` weapon whose `GetReinforcement` still answers 25.
//! 3. `weaponSkill` is the ash of war's **`EquipParamGem` row**, re-tagged with
//!    the game's gem category (see [`GEM_ITEM_CATEGORY`]). The planner's own
//!    database tags ashes with nibble 2, which is the planner's convention and
//!    not the game's, so the nibble is REPLACED rather than kept.
