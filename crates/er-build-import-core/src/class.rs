//! Starting classes, in the order the GAME stores them.
//!
//! `PlayerGameData::archetype` is one byte and `ArchetypeToInitParamId` is literally
//! `archetype + 3000`, so the byte is an index into `CharaInitParam` rows starting at 3000 and
//! the order is that table's, not any list's on any website.
//!
//! # The order was wrong, and it was wrong in a way that reads as plausible
//!
//! Both halves of this repository carried the planner's DISPLAY order, in which Samurai comes
//! sixth. In `CharaInitParam` it is Confessor. So a Confessor exported as `Samurai`, and a build
//! saying `Samurai` imported as a Confessor -- two names swapped in a list of ten, which no smoke
//! test notices and which is exactly what was reported.
//!
//! # Then the list stopped being ten
//!
//! ELDEN RING **1.17** added two classes, `CharaInitParam` 3010 and 3011. This table was a
//! `[&str; 10]`, so `class_for_archetype` answered `None` for both -- and every consumer treats
//! `None` as "no class", not as "this table is older than the game". Export dropped the class
//! silently; import silently never set one. The length now comes from the list itself
//! ([`STARTING_CLASS_COUNT`]), and `scripts/check-starting-classes.py` re-derives the whole table
//! from the installed `regulation.bin` so the next patch fails a gate instead of a character.
//!
//! # Proven from the game's own data, not from a wiki
//!
//! Read straight out of the installed `regulation.bin`: each row carries a starting level at row
//! offset 192 and the eight attributes at 194..=201 (vigour, mind, endurance, strength,
//! dexterity, intelligence, faith, arcane). The rows come out:
//!
//! ```text
//! 3000 Vagabond    lvl  9  vig 15      3006 Confessor    lvl 10  vig 10
//! 3001 Warrior     lvl  8  vig 11      3007 Samurai      lvl  9  vig 12
//! 3002 Hero        lvl  7  vig 14      3008 Prisoner     lvl  9  vig 11
//! 3003 Bandit      lvl  5  vig 10      3009 Wretch       lvl  1  vig 10
//! 3004 Astrologer  lvl  6  vig  9      3010 Idus Knight  lvl  7  vig 10   (1.17)
//! 3005 Prophet     lvl  7  vig 10      3011 Heavy Knight lvl 10  vig 14   (1.17)
//! ```
//!
//! **The `(level, vigour)` pair no longer identifies a class**, which it did on 1.16.2 and which
//! the previous revision of this file said outright: Prophet and Idus Knight are both level 7 with
//! 10 vigour. The full eight-attribute run still is unique, so that is what the tests below pin.
//!
//! # How each NAME is bound to its row
//!
//! `BaseChrSelectMenuParam` -- the class-select list -- links the two tables explicitly. Its class
//! rows (32-byte stride, s32 fields) carry the `CharaInitParam` row id in field 2 and the
//! `GR_MenuText` message id in field 4:
//!
//! ```text
//! row 2000: [1, 3100, 3000,  6, 288100, 0, 0, 0]     -> CharaInit 3000, text 288100 "Vagabond"
//! row 2008: [1, 3112, 3006, 12, 288106, 0, 0, 0]     -> CharaInit 3006, text 288106 "Confessor"
//! row 2010: [1, 3120, 3010, 16, 288110, 0, 0, 0]     -> CharaInit 3010, text 288110 "Idus Knight"
//! row 2011: [1, 3122, 3011, 17, 288111, 0, 0, 0]     -> CharaInit 3011, text 288111 "Heavy Knight"
//! ```
//!
//! Across all rows the message id is exactly `288100 + (charaInitRow - 3000)`, i.e.
//! [`FIRST_CLASS_NAME_MESSAGE_ID`]` + archetype` -- note rows 2006..2008 list Samurai and Prisoner
//! *before* Confessor, which is the display order, and is precisely the trap that produced the
//! original swap. The names themselves are the strings at those ids in
//! `msg/engus/menu.msgbnd.dcx` -> `GR_MenuText.fmg`.
//!
//! Reproduce all of it with `python3 scripts/check-starting-classes.py`, which reads the installed
//! regulation and (when an extracted message corpus is reachable) the FMG, and fails on any
//! disagreement with the table below.
