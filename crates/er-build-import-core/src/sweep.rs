//! What the character is still entitled to be holding once an import has finished.
//!
//! # The invariant
//!
//! Every gear entry the character holds after an import is a copy the build's grant list names,
//! in no more items of it than that list asks for, and every copy that is not has to appear by
//! name in the import's own report with the reason it could not be moved.
//!
//! This module makes the first two thirds of that sentence a function rather than a habit.
//! [`plan_sweep`] gives *every* entry exactly one [`Disposition`], so an entry cannot fall out of
//! the accounting by taking an early exit, and [`survivors`] is the same function run again over
//! the state the pass produced -- which makes the invariant a fixpoint rather than a second
//! opinion about it:
//!
//! ```text
//! survivors(apply(plan_sweep(before, allowance)), allowance) is empty
//! ```
//!
//! # Why this is not a list of cases
//!
//! The pass it serves grew one branch per reported failure: a shield that survived because the
//! shelf count was stale, a shield that survived because the copies being kept were not counted,
//! a shield that survived because taking its Ash of War off changed its item id. Each fix was
//! right and none of them was a rule, so the next shape of the same failure needed a fourth.
//!
//! What all three have in common is that the pass was answering a question about *copies* in a
//! vocabulary of *ids*, over a population it modelled instead of measured. So the decision here
//! is made per entry, keyed on the one name that identifies a copy -- the `GaItemHandle` -- and
//! every category that genuinely behaves differently does so through a named property of the
//! item: its [`Category`], whether it is an [`is_engine_placeholder`], what [`identity`] two
//! copies share. None of them is a branch that names the item.
//!
//! # What the allowance is counted in
//!
//! Items, not entries. A build asking for one Serpent Crest Shield entitles the character to one,
//! however many entries the inventory files them under; a build asking for ninety-nine arrows
//! entitles it to ninety-nine, which may arrive as a single stack. An entry whose quantity runs
//! past what is left of its budget is kept in part and surplus for the remainder, because holding
//! six of something a build asks five of is exactly the state this module exists to forbid.
