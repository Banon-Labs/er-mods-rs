//! Cutting a build's display name down to something Elden Ring will accept as a CHARACTER name.
//!
//! The game has no rename UI, so the only way to give an imported character the build's name is to
//! call `CS::PlayerGameData::CopyChrName` -- and that native validates nothing it needs to. This
//! module is the validation, kept here rather than beside the call because it is pure and this is
//! the half `cargo test` can reach. The call itself is
//! `er_build_import_runtime::chr_name::adopt_build_name`, which pins [`CHR_NAME_MAX_UNITS`] below
//! against the real `PlayerGameData` layout so the two cannot drift.

/// UTF-16 code units a character name may actually contain.
///
/// `PlayerGameData::characterName` is a `wchar_t[17]` (`+0x9c`..`+0xbe`), and the last unit is the
/// terminator -- but the binding number is the native writer's own gate, which is literally
/// `if (wcslen(name) < 0x11)`. A 17-unit name would FIT the array and still be refused, silently,
/// leaving the old name in place and the caller with nothing to report.

/// # The UTF-16 handling, which is the whole of this function
///
/// Three separate ways a name can be wrong here, and the native catches none of them:
///
/// 1. **Length is counted in UTF-16 code units, not chars and not bytes.** `CopyChrName` compares
///    `wcslen(name) < 0x11`. An emoji or any other astral character is TWO units, so a 16-character
///    name can be a 32-unit string. Counting `chars()` would build a buffer the native silently
///    refuses; counting `len()` (bytes) would cut a name far shorter than it needs to be. This
///    accumulates `char::len_utf16` and stops before the budget is exceeded, so a surrogate PAIR is
///    never split -- a lone surrogate is not valid UTF-16, and is what a byte- or char-based cut
///    produces.
/// 2. **An interior NUL truncates the name silently.** A Rust `String` may contain `U+0000`; the
///    native measures with `wcslen`, so everything after the first NUL would vanish without a word.
///    Control characters are dropped for the same class of reason -- they render as boxes, and this
///    name goes out to other players.
/// 3. **The buffer must be NUL-terminated.** `CopyChrName` runs `wcslen` on the argument BEFORE it
///    validates anything, so handing it an unterminated slice is an out-of-bounds read of the
///    caller's memory, not a rejected name. The terminator is pushed here, once, rather than left
///    to a caller to remember.
