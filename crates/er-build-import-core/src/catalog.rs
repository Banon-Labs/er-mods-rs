//! The item catalog: name -> item id, scoped by category.
//!
//! # Why lookup MUST be category-scoped
//!
//! Elden Ring reuses item names across categories, so a flat name->id map grants
//! the wrong item. Measured against the planner's own database (2063 entries),
//! seven names are ambiguous:
//!
//! | name | spell | ash of war | other |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `Golden Vow` | 6600 | 60300 | consumable 2003170 |
//! | `Beast Claw` | 6820 | -- | weapon 68500000 |
//! | `Glintstone Pebble` | 4000 | 20300 | -- |
//! | `Glintblade Phalanx` | 4300 | 20000 | -- |
//! | `Carian Greatsword` | 4430 | 21900 | -- |
//! | `Carian Retaliation` | 4640 | 30500 | -- |
//! | `Thops's Barrier` | 4630 | 31000 | -- |
//!
//! A build that lists `Golden Vow` under `spells` and a weapon whose `weaponArt`
//! is `Golden Vow` means two different item ids from one string, so [`Catalog`]
//! takes the [`Kind`] as part of the key rather than as a hint.
