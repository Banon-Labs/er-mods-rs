//! The import's inventory invariant, over generated prior inventories rather than chosen ones.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! The sweep that sends the previous build's gear back to storage was fixed three times in one
//! day, each time against the case that had just been reported: a shield that survived a stale
//! shelf count, a shield that survived an uncounted kept copy, a shield that survived its own Ash
//! of War changing its item id. Three fixes, three cases, no rule -- and a fourth live run found
//! five more survivors.
//!
//! So the rule is asserted here instead, against pairs nobody chose. Each case generates a prior
//! inventory and a target build, runs [`plan_sweep`], applies it, and checks the invariant on the
//! result. A sweep that handles the three reported cases and misses the fourth shape fails one of
//! these long before it reaches a player.
//!
//! # The invariant, in three parts
//!
//! * **Totality.** Every entry has exactly one disposition. An entry that leaves the
//!   classification without one is how a survivor becomes invisible rather than reported.
//! * **Exactness.** After the plan is applied, no identity is held in more items than the build
//!   asks for, and nothing outside the gear categories has been touched at all.
//! * **Maximality.** An entry is surplus only when no arrangement of the allowance covers it.
//!   Without this half the invariant is satisfiable by evicting everything, which would pass a
//!   test and empty a player's pockets.
//!
//! Maximality is checked against an independent oracle -- a max-flow over identities and budgets,
//! written here and sharing no code with the thing it judges.
