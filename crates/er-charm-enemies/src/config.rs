//! `er-charm-enemies.toml`, re-read while the game runs.
//!
//! Hand-parsed rather than pulled through a TOML crate: four scalar settings do not justify a
//! dependency in a DLL that is cross-compiled into the game process.
//!
//! # Why it reloads
//!
//! The hotkey was read ONCE, at attach, into a `OnceLock`. Changing it meant quitting Elden Ring,
//! which is a long way to go to find out you picked a key another mod had already taken -- and
//! finding that out is exactly what makes a player want to change it. The file is now re-read about
//! once a second (`er_hotkey_config::HotFile`, which compares the file's TEXT so a fast edit cannot
//! fall inside one mtime tick) and the new key is live on the next keyboard poll.
//!
//! Two rules the reload has to get right, both of them ways a "working" reload looks broken:
//!
//! * A key that moved RESETS the edge detector. Without that, a key held at the instant of the swap
//!   is already latched as down, and releasing it -- or the very next poll -- reads as a fresh
//!   press the player never made.
//! * A key that did NOT move must not report a change, or every reformatting of the file produces
//!   that same phantom press.
//!
//! # Why it also WRITES
//!
//! `enabled` is the one setting that changes from inside the game: the hotkey toggles it. Holding
//! that in memory only means the feature is off again on every launch, so [`persist_enabled`]
//! writes it back here -- which makes this DLL both the writer and the watcher of one file, and
//! that is a feedback loop with three ways to go wrong. All three are handled where they arise
//! rather than discovered at runtime:
//!
//! * The write must not read back as somebody's EDIT. `HotFile` compares text, so the write is
//!   followed by a read-back and [`HotFile::adopt`] of the exact bytes that landed. A reload
//!   resets the key edge detector, so a self-write reported as an edit is a phantom keypress once
//!   a second.
//! * The write must not DESTROY the file. It is mostly comments, and those comments are this
//!   feature's only documentation. `er_hotkey_config::persist::set_scalar` rewrites the one
//!   `enabled` line where it already is and copies every other byte through.
//! * The player may be editing at the same time. The write re-reads the file immediately before
//!   rewriting it, so an edit made since the last poll is carried through rather than reverted,
//!   and the read-back is applied so that edit takes effect NOW instead of a second later. What is
//!   left is a microsecond-wide window between that read and the rename in which their save loses;
//!   nothing portable closes it, and only the `enabled` line is ever at stake.

// Windows-only in practice; kept portable so the parser and the reload decision below are covered
// by `cargo test` on the host, where the windows-gated modules that consume them are compiled out.
