//! The in-game hotkey, read where Elden Ring itself reads the keyboard.
//!
//! A `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook is not enough: with the game focused, its keyboard state comes from
//! `IDirectInputDevice8::GetDeviceState`, so the DIK table that call fills is the only place a
//! keypress is guaranteed to be visible from inside the process. This hooks vtable slot 9 on a
//! throwaway probe device -- every DirectInput device of a class shares one vtable, so the probe's
//! slot address is the game's -- and reads the combination out of the buffer on the way back.
//!
//! Devices of different classes can also share that implementation, and then the mouse arrives at
//! the keyboard hook with a 16-byte `DIMOUSESTATE`. Reading DIK offsets out of one finds nothing,
//! which reads as "the hotkey was released" and re-arms the press on the very next keyboard poll.
//! The 256-byte size check is what keeps a held hotkey from toggling once per interleaved poll.
