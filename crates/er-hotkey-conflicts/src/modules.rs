//! The loaded-module map: which DLL owns a given code address, and has the list stopped moving.
//!
//! Two jobs, both feeding the same question:
//!
//! * **Attribution.** A return address captured in a detour is just a number. Turning it into
//!   `er_invasion_warp.dll` is what makes "which mod polled F7" answerable without that mod
//!   exporting anything, cooperating, or even knowing this DLL exists. That property -- working
//!   against ANY author's binary -- is the whole reason the observation is done at the API rather
//!   than by asking each mod what it binds.
//! * **The settle gate.** A fingerprint over the module list, so "everything has loaded" is a
//!   thing that can be observed instead of slept through.
