//! Which module actually asked for the key -- and why a stack walk alone does not answer that.
//!
//! # The problem
//!
//! A detour on `GetAsyncKeyState` wants the CALLER's return address, and a stack walk gives it.
//! But this DLL registers through the cross-DLL hook union, and the union chains handlers: the
//! stack inside our detour is
//!
//! ```text
//!   [ our handler ]                       <- where the walk starts
//!   [ another mod's handler on this API ] <- zero or more of these
//!   [ union_dispatch, in whichever DLL owns the MinHook instance ]
//!   [ the real caller ]                   <- the one we want
//!   [ whatever called that ]
//! ```
//!
//! Taking "the first frame outside our own module" therefore names the union host, or another
//! mod's handler -- and the second case is worse than useless, because it would report the mod
//! that merely OBSERVES the keyboard as the one that binds every key on it. That is a confident
//! wrong answer in a tool whose entire output is an accusation.
//!
//! # The rule, in three clauses
//!
//! 1. **Strip our own frames.** The walk starts inside this DLL's detour, so the first frames are
//!    always ours. Matched by MODULE, never by a hard-coded skip count -- which frame the unwinder
//!    calls "frame zero" differs between Windows and Wine, and a constant there would be an
//!    untested assumption sitting under every attribution the DLL makes.
//!
//! 2. **Strip the union host.** Exactly one dispatcher frame stands between the patched prologue
//!    and the first handler, and it lives in whichever DLL owns the MinHook instance. That module
//!    is KNOWN at registration time (`HookRoute`), so this clause is exact rather than inferred.
//!
//! 3. **Strip the leading frames every chain agrees on -- but only while they still look like
//!    handlers.** Other mods' handlers on the same prologue are fixed overhead too, and their
//!    modules are not known in advance. They ARE the leading frames every call to that API shares,
//!    so a common prefix finds them. A common prefix ALONE is not safe, though, so the walk stops
//!    at the first frame that stops looking like a handler; [`fixed_prefix`] lists the four tests.
//!
//! Those four tests are not caution, they are the difference between a correct answer and a
//! confident wrong one. A raw longest-common-prefix breaks in two shapes that both occur:
//!
//! * a mod that is the ONLY caller of an API shares its whole stack with itself, so the "common
//!   prefix" is its entire stack and the frame past it is the GAME's task runner -- the report
//!   would accuse `eldenring.exe` of binding the mod's hotkey;
//! * a mod polling one key from two call sites has chains that agree for several frames and then
//!   diverge somewhere deeper, so the prefix eats its own frames and lands past it.
//!
//! Requiring two distinct chains kills the first. Refusing to take two frames from one module, and
//! refusing to take a frame in the game executable at all, kill the second.
//!
//! Clause 2 also handles the case a hand-written skip-list cannot: when the union host DLL is
//! itself a caller, its module appears both in the stripped prefix and past it, and the strip is
//! positional rather than a name filter, so it stops in the right place.
//!
//! # Why the raw addresses are kept
//!
//! The prefix is only correct once enough chains have been seen, and more arrive throughout a
//! run. So nothing is attributed on the hot path: raw frame addresses are tallied as they come
//! and the WHOLE tally is attributed from scratch each time a report is rendered. An early call
//! and a late one are always scored by the same rule.

// Windows-only in practice; ungated so the attribution rule -- the part that can be confidently
// wrong -- is covered by `cargo test` on the host.
