//! The one warning, and everything that must be true for it to be worth reading.

//! * **The verdict is the first line.** A reader who stops there must still learn whether they
//!   have a problem.
//! * **A finding names the key AND every module.** "There is a conflict on F7" is a riddle;
//!   "F7: er_invasion_warp.dll, er_invasion_path.dll" is an instruction.
//! * **What was NOT checked is printed as loudly as what was.** Parts of this DLL's coverage are
//!   structurally limited: DirectInput hands back the whole keyboard and never names the key, an
//!   API that could not be hooked is a hole, and the game's binding singleton is NULL until the
//!   game initialises it. Leaving any of those silent turns "I did not look" into "there is
//!   nothing there", which is the failure mode that lets a real conflict ship.
//! * **Identical evidence renders identical text.** Everything upstream is a `BTreeMap`, so two
//!   runs can be diffed to see whether a config change helped.
