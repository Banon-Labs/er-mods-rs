//! What was observed, and what it adds up to.
//!
//! The whole product of this DLL is one paragraph of text, so the part worth testing is the part
//! that decides what that paragraph says. Everything here is pure: observations go in, a report
//! comes out, and no game, no Windows API and no hook is involved. The Windows half's only job is
//! to feed it honest input.
//!
//! # Two tiers of evidence, kept apart on purpose
//!
//! Some input APIs name the key in their arguments -- `GetAsyncKeyState(VK_F7)` says *F7*, right
//! there. Those give an EXACT `(module, key)` pair and an exact collision.
//!
//! DirectInput does not. `IDirectInputDevice8::GetDeviceState` hands back all 256 scancodes at
//! once and the caller picks its own out of the buffer afterwards, in its own code, where nothing
//! is observable. A module reading that buffer could be bound to any key on the board. Reporting
//! that as "no collision found" would be a lie of omission, so it is reported as its own,
//! explicitly weaker claim -- and the keys that turn out to be CONSUMED from that buffer (see
//! [`crate::dik`]) are reported as a third thing again.
//!
//! Conflating the tiers is the failure this split exists to prevent: the reproducer that motivated
//! the crate (two mods on `F7`) is tier one, and drowning it in tier-two noise would bury it.

// Windows-only in practice; ungated so the census, the collision table and the report renderer
// stay covered by `cargo test` on the host.
