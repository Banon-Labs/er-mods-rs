//! Elden Ring's OWN key bindings, read out of the game's configuration singleton.
//!
//! # Where this comes from
//!
//! Static reverse engineering against the 1.16.2 Ghidra dump, 2026-08-25. The whole binding
//! configuration -- keyboard, mouse and gamepad together -- lives in one FD4 singleton whose
//! global pointer sits at [`CS_PC_KEY_CONFIG_SINGLETON_RVA`]. Ghidra names that global
//! `GLOBAL_CSPcKeyConfig`.
//!
//! ```text
//!   CSPcKeyConfig* cfg = *(u64*)(game_base + 0x3d5dea8);   // NULL until the game initialises it
//!
//!   cfg + 0x000   u8    input-device source (title screen writes 0 = pad, 1 = keyboard/mouse)
//!   cfg + 0x004   u32   ACTIVE input device: 0 -> pad bindings, 1 -> keyboard then mouse
//!   cfg + 0x008         DEFAULT binding table, 0x36 entries x 0x14, from KeyAssignParam_TypeA
//!   cfg + 0x440         CURRENT binding table -- what the PLAYER configured. This one.
//!
//!   struct KeyAssign {          // 0x14 bytes, one per action, -1 = unbound
//!       i32 padKeyId;           // +0x00  CS_PAD_KEY
//!       i32 keyboardKeyId;      // +0x04  CS_KEYBOARD_KEY
//!       i32 keyboardModify;     // +0x08  CS_MODIFIER_KEY bitmask
//!       i32 mouseKeyId;         // +0x0c  CS_MOUSE_KEY
//!       i32 mouseModify;        // +0x10  CS_MODIFIER_KEY bitmask
//!   };
//! ```
//!
//! The accessor `GetAssign(cfg, out[0x14], actionIndex, mode)` at RVA `0x242ab0` is literally
//! `cmp r8d,0x35; ja fail; lea rcx,[rcx + idx*0x14 + 0x440]`, which is where both the entry stride
//! and the `0x36` bound come from. This crate does NOT call it -- reading the table directly is a
//! pure load and cannot re-enter the game -- but it is the citation for the layout.
//!
//! # The keyboard key id is not a scancode
//!
//! `keyboardKeyId` is a game-internal enum in `0x46..=0xd5`, turned into a DirectInput scancode by
//! a lookup table in the game's own image. From `KeyboardDevice::IsKeyDown` (RVA `0x1f6d0f0`):
//!
//! ```text
//!   if ((unsigned)(keyId - 0x46) < 0x90) {
//!       int dik = ((i32*)(base + 0x3c449a0))[keyId - 0x46];
//!       if (dik >= 0) return (diState[0x7e8 + dik] & 0x80) != 0;
//!   }
//! ```
//!
//! The table is READ from the running image rather than transcribed here. A transcribed copy is a
//! second source of truth that goes stale on the next patch and produces a warning naming the
//! wrong key, which is worse than no warning.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not read
//!
//! * **Action NAMES.** They are not strings in the executable: `CS_KEY_ASSIGN_MENUITEM_PARAM`
//!   carries a `textID` into an FMG message table, so naming them means loading and decoding
//!   `menu.msgbnd.dcx`. The action INDEX is reported instead -- enough to say "the game already
//!   uses this key", which is the question, without inventing a label.
//! * **Mouse bindings.** `CS_MOUSE_KEY` is a separate id space starting at `0x400` that the RE
//!   pass did not enumerate. Guessing at it would put wrong buttons in a warning.
//! * **Pad bindings.** They ARE in the table and could be decoded, but a mod's pad binding is not
//!   observable on the other side: `XInputGetState` hands back the whole pad and never names a
//!   button, so there is nothing to compare them against.

// Windows-only in practice; ungated so the decode and the comparison are covered by `cargo test`.
