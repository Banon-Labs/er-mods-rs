//! Scancodes, virtual keys, and catching the bindings that carry neither.
//!
//! # The blind spot this closes
//!
//! `IDirectInputDevice8::GetDeviceState` -- where Elden Ring itself reads the keyboard, and where
//! `er-charm-enemies` and `er-net-effects` read theirs -- hands back all 256 scancodes at once.
//! The caller picks its own key out of the buffer afterwards, in its own code. Hooking the call
//! therefore says *that* a module reads the keyboard and never *which key* it is bound to.
//!
//! But several of those mods do something observable: they ZERO their trigger key in the buffer on
//! the way back, so the game does not also act on it. That is visible. A key that
//! `GetAsyncKeyState` says is physically held, while the DirectInput buffer the game receives says
//! it is up, has been taken by somebody in the chain.
//!
//! So this module carries the scancode table needed to line the two views up, and the state
//! machine that decides when the disagreement is real rather than a sampling artefact.
//!
//! # What it cannot see, stated plainly
//!
//! * A mod that merely READS its key without blanking it consumes nothing and leaves no trace
//!   here. It still shows up as a whole-keyboard reader; its key stays unknown.
//! * The buffer is snapshotted at THIS DLL's position in the handler chain. A handler that
//!   registered before us blanks the byte after we have already looked, so its key is invisible.
//!   Handlers that registered after us are seen.
//! * The consumer is not named. Every module that hooks the DirectInput slot is a candidate, and
//!   the API gives nothing to tell them apart.

// Windows-only in practice; ungated so the table and the streak rule are covered by `cargo test`
// on the host, where a wrong table would otherwise only show up as a wrong warning in a game.
