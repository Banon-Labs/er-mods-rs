//! One line on whatever overlay the process already has. Never a second one.
//!
//! This DLL is a GUEST and only a guest. It never calls `Hudhook::apply()`, even when nothing else
//! in the process hosts an overlay -- two `apply()` calls double-hook `Present` and the second one
//! silently renders nothing, which is the failure `er_build_watermark_core::overlay_host` exists
//! to end. A diagnostic sentence is not worth owning the swapchain and putting a richer UI at risk
//! of being the one that loses.
//!
//! The consequence, stated rather than hidden: loaded ALONE, with no watermark and no path
//! overlay in the profile, this DLL draws nothing at all. The report is in the log either way, and
//! the log is the primary surface.
