//! Which mods in this profile are fighting over the same key -- and does the game already use it.
//!
//! # The bug this exists to have caught
//!
//! In a live fifteen-DLL profile, `er-invasion-warp` polled `VK_F7` every frame and a second shell
//! had defaulted its own toggle to `F7`. Pressing F7 warped the player instead of toggling the
//! other feature. Nothing crashed, nothing logged an error, and nothing anywhere warned -- the
//! collision was found by a human noticing that a key did the wrong thing. Every piece of
//! information needed to predict it was already in the process; nobody was looking.
//!
//! This DLL looks. It watches the input APIs, works out which module each call came from, and once
//! the profile has settled it prints ONE warning naming every input that more than one party
//! wants.
//!
//! # Why it observes the APIs instead of asking the mods
//!
//! It has to work against ANY author's DLL. A third-party mod exports nothing you can query, ships
//! no manifest of its bindings, and will never cooperate. Sitting on `GetAsyncKeyState` and
//! attributing the caller works on a binary you have never seen, which is the only property that
//! makes the tool worth having.
//!
//! # It changes nothing
//!
//! Every detour chains to the original and returns its value untouched; no input is swallowed,
//! altered or injected; no param row is patched (that breaks Seamless invasions); no game memory
//! is written; nothing is loaded into the process that was not already there. The two reads it
//! does perform -- the loaded-module list and the game's own key-configuration table -- are loads.
//!
//! # What it cannot see
//!
//! Written down here rather than left to be discovered, because a blind spot the reader does not
//! know about is worse than one they do:
//!
//! * **A binding read through DirectInput has no key.** `GetDeviceState` returns all 256 scancodes
//!   at once and the caller picks its own afterwards, in its own code. Those modules are reported
//!   as whole-keyboard readers, explicitly as NOT CHECKED. The one thing that does recover a key
//!   is a mod BLANKING it -- see [`dik`].
//! * **A mod that reads `inputmgr+0x90+eventId`** -- the game's decoded per-action keystate bitmap
//!   -- calls no API at all. Catching it needs a data breakpoint, which is not passive.
//! * **Action names.** The game's binding table gives an action INDEX; the names live in an FMG
//!   message table, not in the executable, so the report prints the index.

// Ungated on purpose: the census, the attribution rule, the scancode table, the settle gate and
// the report renderer are pure and are exercised by `cargo test` on the host. That is most of the
// crate, and it is where a wrong answer would come from.
