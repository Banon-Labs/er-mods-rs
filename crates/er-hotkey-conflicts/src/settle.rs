//! When "everything has loaded and the checks have run" is actually true.
//!
//! The brief for this DLL is one warning, printed once the profile has settled. A sleep would be
//! the obvious way to decide that and the wrong one: me3 loads natives in profile order, each one
//! spawns its own install thread, and several of them arm their input hooks lazily from a game
//! frame rather than at attach. A fixed delay is a guess about all of that, and it is a guess that
//! silently reports half a profile whenever a machine is slower than the machine it was tuned on.
//!
//! So the gate is evidence-driven, and it needs BOTH halves:
//!
//! * **The module list has stopped changing.** A signature over the loaded modules, unchanged for
//!   [`STABLE_TICKS`] consecutive frames. This is what says every DLL is in.
//! * **Input is actually being polled.** [`MIN_CALLS`] observed calls. The module list goes stable
//!   at the title screen, long before any mod's per-frame hotkey loop is running, so stability
//!   alone would fire the report against an empty census and call the profile clean.
//!
//! And a backstop, because a report that never prints is worse than an early one: after
//! [`BACKSTOP_TICKS`] the gate fires regardless. A profile where no hook ever fired still gets its
//! verdict, which in that case is `UNKNOWN` and says so.

// Windows-only in practice; ungated so the gate is covered by `cargo test` -- it is a state
// machine whose failure mode is a report that never appears, which no other gate would catch.
