//! The observation surface: every input-read API a mod can plausibly bind a hotkey to.
//!
//! # The constraint that shapes all of this
//!
//! It must work against ANY author's DLL. A third-party mod exports nothing you can query, has no
//! config you can parse and will never cooperate. The only general mechanism left is to sit on the
//! APIs everybody has to call and record who called them -- so this DLL hooks the input functions
//! and attributes each call to the module it came from.
//!
//! # Passive means passive
//!
//! Every detour here has the same body: call the rest of the chain FIRST, then record what was
//! asked for, then return the chain's value byte for byte. Nothing is swallowed, nothing is
//! altered, nothing is injected, and no buffer is written. The bookkeeping cannot even delay the
//! call, because it happens after the value is already in hand.
//!
//! # Through the union, never a private MinHook
//!
//! `er-effects-rs`, `er-net-effects` and `er-charm-enemies` all detour the DirectInput
//! `GetDeviceState` slot. A fourth private MinHook instance on that prologue would overwrite
//! somebody's trampoline and silently disable their feature -- which is exactly the class of bug
//! this DLL was written to report on, and it would be absurd to cause one. So every registration
//! goes through [`er_hook::register_shared_hook`], which chains into the single instance the
//! product DLL owns when the product is loaded, and into this DLL's own union when it is not.
//!
//! # What this cannot see, stated where it is implemented
//!
//! * A mod that reads `inputmgr+0x90+eventId` directly -- the game's own decoded per-action
//!   keystate bitmap -- calls no API at all. Catching that needs a data breakpoint on the bitmap,
//!   which means stealing the debug registers process-wide and taking every write through a
//!   vectored handler. That is not a passive observer, so it is not done. It is the one input
//!   path in this file's list with no coverage.
//! * A mod that reads raw input (`WM_INPUT` / `GetRawInputData`) from its own subclassed window
//!   procedure. Reachable in principle; not hooked here.
