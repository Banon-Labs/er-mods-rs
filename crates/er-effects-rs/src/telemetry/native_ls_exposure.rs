// NATIVE LOADING-SCREEN EXPOSURE SEMAPHORE (er-effects-rs-wmw defect #1, user report 2026-07-30:
// "the custom loading screen disappeared for about one frame and the vanilla loading screen flashed
// through").
//
// The defect is a PER-FRAME event, so it needs a per-frame oracle: the aggregate counters we already
// had (`oracle_boot_view_stop_reason`, `oracle_portrait_onto_draw_hits`) can say the cover stopped,
// but never that a frame REACHED THE SCREEN with the game's own loading screen visible. This module
// closes that gap. On every Present the detour reports which gate decided this frame's cover; when
// the game's `CS::LoadingScreen` is live and the cover did NOT draw, the frame is latched as an
// EXPOSURE frame -- literally the frame the user saw vanilla -- and attributed to the blocking gate.
//
// Telemetry-only: nothing here changes what is drawn. It converts a visual report into a RAM oracle
// so the flash-through can be reproduced and attributed without reading a screenshot.
//
// NOT the same thing as `BOOT_VIEW_NATIVE_EXPOSURE_FRAMES` / `oracle_boot_view_native_exposure_*`
// (branch loading-portrait-semaphores-20260730). That one lives in the cover state machine and
// counts times the cover was RESUMED because the native loading screen reappeared -- a mitigation,
// measured at the decision layer, which cannot say whether a frame actually reached the screen. This
// one is measured at Present, the last point before the user's eyes, and counts the frames
// themselves. Whether that resume mitigation works is exactly a question these counters can answer.
//
// Reading the oracles:
//   oracle_native_ls_exposure_frames   > 0  the defect occurred; the user COULD see vanilla
//   oracle_native_ls_exposure_max_run  == 1 a one-frame flash (the exact user report)
//                                      >> 1 a sustained hole (e.g. the FPS bail killing the cover)
//   oracle_native_ls_exposure_by_gate  which gate blocked the cover, by `NATIVE_LS_GATE_*` code
//   oracle_native_ls_exposure_last_stop_reason  BOOT_VIEW_STOP_REASON at the last exposure frame
//                                      (1 = release fade, 2 = FPS bail, 3 = world handoff)
//
// THE OTHER HALF OF THE FRAME (2026-08-22). This module only judges frames where the native
// loading screen is LIVE, and that turned out to be a blind spot as large as the one it closed: the
// "loading screen reappears after Escape" report happens AFTER the native screen stops ticking, so
// the only per-frame oracle in the DLL switched itself off for the whole window the user was
// describing and the reproducing run logged nothing at all. The stale frames now go to
// `cover_after_release.rs` instead of being dropped. Nothing here changed to make room for it.
//
// A frame is only judged while the native loading screen is LIVE. `LOADING_SCREEN_UPDATE_LAST_MS` is
// stamped by the native CS::LoadingScreen::Update hook every frame the screen ticks, so freshness is
// the live signal. The window is deliberately wider than one frame (the game presents as slowly as
// ~5 fps during loading, bd FPS-DELTA-CONFIRMED-load2-20fps-load1-45fps) so a slow frame is not
// misread as the screen having closed; it is still far below the 1500 ms window-close quiet period
// used by [`portrait_loadwin_tick`].
