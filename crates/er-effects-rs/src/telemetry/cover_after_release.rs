// POST-RELEASE COVER WATCH: product re-export facade.
//
// The watch itself -- the per-frame cover-plate sample, the in-game-menu open stamps, the log/
// telemetry clock map and the oracle emitter -- moved to
// `er_loading_portrait_core::cover_after_release` with the loading-cover crate extraction. Its
// rationale, its cost note and every oracle's meaning travelled with it.
//
// What stays here is the three product entry points, each wrapped so the loading-cover seam is
// installed before any moved code runs: the moved module reaches `append_autoload_debug`,
// `push_json_usize`, `process_log_elapsed_ms`, `boot_view_epoch_ms_if_anchored` and
// `fake_loading_screen_visible` through it.

/// Sample the post-release state for one presented frame. Called from
/// [`native_ls_exposure_record`] on exactly the frames that function declines to judge.
