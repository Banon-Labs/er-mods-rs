// POST-RELEASE COVER WATCH (user report 2026-08-22: "pressing Escape quickly after the loading
// screen fades out -- while the location banner is still on screen -- makes the loading screen and
// portrait briefly reappear and tear down"; timing-dependent on opening the menu swiftly).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The run that reproduced the defect, br-20260822-184123-fa3d, left ZERO
// trace in the DLL log. Not a weak trace -- none. Every aggregate counter said the cover was long
// dead (`BOOT_VIEW_STOPPED` latched and never cleared, `oracle_boot_view_epoch_seq=0`,
// `oracle_boot_view_fps_bail_resumes=0`), and the only PER-FRAME oracle we own,
// [`native_ls_exposure_record`], switches ITSELF off in this exact window: it returns unless the
// game's `CS::LoadingScreen` ticked within 250 ms, and in that run the native screen stopped
// ticking ~2.2 s BEFORE our cover stopped. The one moment worth watching was the one moment
// nothing watched. This is the mirror of that function for the other side of the release.
//
// WHAT IT MEASURES, and what each answer means:
//
//   oracle_cover_after_release_samples == 0
//       the watch never opened. Every zero below is then meaningless -- read this FIRST. It is 0
//       when no cover window has stopped yet, or when every stop is older than the watch span.
//   oracle_cover_plate_visible_after_release > 0
//       the GAME's own `CSFakeLoadingScreenImp` cover plate read VISIBLE on a frame that reached
//       Present, after our cover had already released. That is the surface the user described, and
//       it is the game's, not ours. `_max_run` separates a brief reappearance (short run) from a
//       plate that simply never went down (one run as long as the watch).
//   oracle_native_ls_activity_after_release_updates / _fadeouts > 0
//       the game's own loading screen kept working past our release: `CS::LoadingScreen::Update`
//       ticks and Scaleform fade-out stamps, measured as deltas against baselines snapshotted at
//       the stop. A legitimate NEW load starting inside the watch span (a death, a fast travel)
//       would also show here, so read these next to `oracle_portrait_loadwin_history` rather than
//       alone.
//   oracle_in_game_menu_open_first_ms_after_cover_stop
//       when the user opened the in-world pause/System menu after the cover released -- the Escape
//       press the report is about. Subtract it from
//       `oracle_cover_plate_visible_after_release_first_ms` and the answer is the press-to-
//       reappearance interval, which used to be a hand pairing of a log line against an oracle. 0
//       means no menu open was seen past a cover stop, which makes any plate hit above NOT the
//       reported defect. `_edges` / `_last_ms` cover the whole session; see
//       `in_game_menu_note_run_tick` for what the edge is and what it costs in precision.
//   oracle_log_epoch_offset_ms
//       the constant separating this log's `[+Nms]` prefixes from every telemetry `*_ms` above:
//       `log = telemetry + offset`. Emitted so nobody measures it again by hand.
//
// This changes NOTHING that is drawn. It is telemetry, and it deliberately does not attempt a
// pixel probe: whether the plate is up is answerable from RAM, and a full-frame readback in the
// Present path is not something to add before the cheap question has been asked.
//
// COST. Two `ReadProcessMemory` self-reads per sampled frame (the fault-guarded singleton walk in
// `fake_loading_screen_visible`) and a handful of relaxed atomics. Bounded by
// `COVER_AFTER_RELEASE_WATCH_MS` so gameplay does not pay for it forever: after a stop the watch
// runs for that span and then goes quiet until the next cover window stops.

/// How long past a cover stop the watch samples. The reported defect happens while the location
/// banner is still up -- seconds, not minutes -- so this is generous by an order of magnitude and
/// still bounds the per-frame cost to one span per cover window. It is a COST bound, not a
