// Portrait FRAMING oracles: the frozen crop envelope and the applied orbit camera.
//
// These live in their own include file rather than inline in `write_game_module_oracles.rs` only
// because that file sits within ~20 lines of the 3200-line hard gate
// (`scripts/check-rust-file-sizes.py`) and has no room for a group this size; the split is the same
// mechanism `runtime_oracles.rs` already documents for exactly that pressure.
//
// What the group as a whole answers: "why is this character's portrait framed like that, and is the
// framing the same as the last character's?" Until 2026-08-21 an artifact set could not answer either
// question -- the apparent size of the portrait is decided by a crop rect and an orbit camera, and
// neither exported a single value, only derived summaries and "it ran" counters.

fn write_portrait_framing_oracles(body: &mut String) {
    // CROP ENVELOPE (portrait_overlay.rs): the head's alpha bounding box, unioned over the first
    // PORTRAIT_CROP_SEED_N frames and then FROZEN; the crop is rescaled so its height is 80% of the
    // screen, which makes this rect -- not the camera alone -- the last word on apparent portrait size.
    // Only the derived AREA (`oracle_portrait_alpha_cover_pct`, emitted just above) was exported, and a
    // percentage cannot say WHERE the rect is or what shape it has, so two characters' framing could not
    // be compared and an implausible percentage could not be attributed. The four bounds do both.
    //
    // Reading them: minx/miny start at `usize::MAX` and maxx/maxy at 0, so a run that never seeded
    // reports exactly that sentinel pair rather than a plausible-looking rect. `seed_frames` counts the
    // frames FOLDED INTO the envelope and saturates at PORTRAIT_CROP_SEED_N (until 2026-08-22 it counted
    // every composited frame and a live run read 324 against a window of 40, so it could not answer the one
    // question it exists for); at the cap the rect can no longer move, so a bad rect at that point is
    // permanent for the rest of the loading screen. `growth_events` is how many of those folds actually
    // MOVED a bound -- i.e. how many visible size steps the settle took, since apparent head size is
    // `dst_h / crop_h`. The per-event detail (which bound, by how much, resulting crop_h) is in the autoload
    // debug log as `portrait-crop[sN/40]` lines; only the DLL can see it, because the seed window is under a
    // second and this file is a point-in-time latch with no history. A rect covering
    // (near) the whole source is the signature of one fully-opaque, unkeyed frame having been folded in
    // -- which is what a measured cover_pct of 99 against a depth_key_bg_pct of 76 implies.

    //     a frame to publish. The head appears when the worker publishes; nothing wrong.
    //   * draw > 0 -- an unmasked buffer got PAST publish and only the compositor stopped it. That is a
    //     publish-side hole, not a compositor one; find the writer.
    //   * both 0 with `oracle_portrait_alpha_cover_pct` near 100 -- the gate is not catching what it was
    //     built for. The percentage and the refusals disagreeing is the signal, which is exactly why a
    //     permanently-0 counter here would have been worse than no counter.
