// `GLOBAL_CSGaitem` is a PROCESS-LIFETIME FD4 singleton (constructed once at boot by the giant
// repository-init FUN_140cd6d40 behind `if (GLOBAL_CSGaitem==0)`; NOT rebuilt per world-load). Its
// pointer lives at dump 0x143d69890 (data RVA, stable across deobf; the unmodified
// PlayerGameData::Deserialize reads this same global and boot loads work through it). On a normal
// quit-to-title the world/inventory teardown releases the player's gaitems back to the free-queue
// via RemoveCSGaitemIns; our lightweight return-title chain (0x67a3a0) skips that, so char#1's
// items stay resident, char#2's reload deserialize exhausts freeTableIdxQueue (head==end ->
// GetUnindexedGaItemHandle returns 0 -> gaitemInsTable[-1] OOB dispatch = the AV at live 0x67141a).
// We restore pristine at clean title before the reload by sweeping occupied gaitemInsTable slots
// and calling the native per-item release RemoveCSGaitemIns (which frees the ins AND returns its
// index to the free-queue) -- the exact primitive the native teardown would use, no hand-rebuilt
// queue. See bd system-quit-postswitch-crash-gaitem-freequeue-exhaustion-2026-07-02.
