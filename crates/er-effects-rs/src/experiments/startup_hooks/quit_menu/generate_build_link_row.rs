//! The System>Quit **Generate Build Link** row -- the exact inverse of the row above it.
//!
//! Load Build from URL takes a planner link and rewrites this character. This one takes this
//! character and writes a planner link: it reads the equipped loadout, the memorised spells and the
//! stats, encodes them into a self-contained `?i=` share URL, puts that URL on the clipboard and
//! asks the OS to open it.
//!
//! # Nothing is sent anywhere
//!
//! The planner has two share formats and only one of them is a server record. `?b=<id>` is an id
//! for a build stored on the API; creating one needs an account, which would mean minting a user
//! per player per link on one person's free hobby service. `?i=<payload>` carries the WHOLE build
//! in the URL -- LZUTF8 over base64 over JSON -- and is decoded entirely in the player's browser.
//! This row emits the second. There is no request, no account, and no way for it to fail because
//! someone else's server is down.
//!
//! # Which half runs where
//!
//! The press latches a request and returns; it may arrive on any thread, inside a native
//! `PropertyNewButtonController` action, and reading `PlayerGameData` from there is not allowed.
//! The recurring `FrameBegin` task does the read -- a few dozen native getter calls -- and hands the
//! finished document to a worker, because `ShellExecuteW` spawns `winebrowser`, which spawns
//! `xdg-open`, which spawns a browser, and none of that belongs on the frame.
//!
//! # The row reports on itself
//!
//! Unlike the link field next door, this row opens no dialog, so when the export finishes there is
//! no other surface to say what happened. Its help line is a live buffer that becomes the outcome:
//! how long the link is, whether it was copied, whether a browser took it.
