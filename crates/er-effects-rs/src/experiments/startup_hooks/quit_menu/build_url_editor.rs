//! The in-game link field behind the System>Quit **Load Build from URL** row.
//!
//! Pressing the row opens the game's own `CS::SoftwareKeyboard` over the Quit dialog, pre-filled
//! with the link on the clipboard (or the bare `?b=` prefix). Accepting a link that validates
//! imports it; accepting one that does not RE-OPENS the field with the text still in it and the
//! reason on the row's help line; backing out applies nothing.
//!
//! # Why "refuse to accept" is a re-open and not a veto
//!
//! There is no native validation hook to say no with. `FUN_14081d3d0`, the job's per-frame result
//! gate, reports `Continue` while `CSMenuManImp+0x858` says the keyboard is up and then reads the
//! controller's result code at `+0x78` -- 2 means the player pressed accept, anything else means
//! they backed out. The validator struct the job is built with (`FUN_140e70920`) holds a max length
//! and flags, not a predicate: nothing in it can refuse a string.
//!
//! So the accept is allowed to complete natively, and the refusal is expressed the only way the
//! engine offers -- by submitting another keyboard job through the same `MenuJobQueue` the row used
//! the first time. The native job owns its own lifetime; we own the decision to ask again. From the
//! player's side the effect is what was asked for: pressing accept on a bad link does not take, the
//! text is still there to fix, and the row says why.
//!
//! # Why the re-open is bounded
//!
//! [`MAX_REJECTED_REOPENS`] caps the chain. The back action always ends it, so the cap is not what
//! lets a player out -- it is what stops a submit that fails for a reason validation cannot see
//! (a queue that never becomes ready, a recipe that stops resolving) from re-arming forever. The
//! save picker learned this the expensive way: an OS dialog that reopened ~57 ms after every cancel,
//! with no way out of the flow (bd `er-effects-rs-rsxi`).
//!
//! # Why the clipboard is read while the field is OPEN and not only when it opens
//!
//! Ctrl+V inside the field does nothing -- the field has no paste, and the one native clipboard
//! reader in the image is unreachable from it (`build_url_clipboard`'s module docs carry the
//! evidence). For a while the answer was "read the clipboard once, when the field opens", and the
//! user's own session shows exactly how that fails, from `er-effects-autoload-debug.log`
//! (`dll:41638ed8`, 2026-08-23):
//!
//! ```text
//! [+47142ms]  submitted native SoftwareKeyboardJob  initial_units=43   <- the bare prefix
//!             ... the player pastes, and waits 36 seconds ...
//! [+83008ms]  native editor accepted text="https://er-build-planner.nyasu.business/?b="  43 units
//! [+83009ms]  REFUSED (nothing was typed after the prefix)
//! [+155745ms] prefilling the editor from the clipboard (57 chars)
//! [+155747ms] submitted native SoftwareKeyboardJob  initial_units=57
//! [+158095ms] native editor accepted ...?b=bc2a932db14675  -> ACCEPTED, import applied
//! ```
//!
//! Two things are proven there. The round trip is sound: 36 seconds in the field returned EXACTLY
//! the 43 units that were put in it, so nothing is stale, dangling or misread. And the link only
//! appeared on a LATER open because that is the only moment this DLL looked at the clipboard. The
//! player experiences that as a one-entry lag -- paste, see nothing, accept, back out, re-enter,
//! and there it is.
//!
//! So the mirror runs every frame the field is up: [`clipboard_sequence`] is a lock-free counter
//! that says whether anything was copied at all, and only a change justifies a real read. A read
//! that yields an importable link REPLACES the field through the game's own SetText. An unrelated
//! copy cannot pass [`clipboard_build_url`]'s validation, so it cannot overwrite what the player is
//! typing.
//!
//! The first few frames also re-read unconditionally, because under Wine the X11-to-Win32 clipboard
//! bridge is asynchronous: a link copied moments before the row press can land after it, with the
//! sequence number already bumped before we first looked.
