//! Save Game destination, commit, and deadline state machine.

use super::*;

// === SAVE-FLOW state machine (save-game-flow WP1 + WP2 + WP3, 2026-07-28) ===
// Drives the System->Quit "Save Game" row's destination pick and CLOSE-THEN-FIRE commit.
// Stage map lives on `er_telemetry_core::counters::SAVE_FLOW_STAGE` (oracle_save_flow_stage):
// 0 IDLE, 3 DEST_BROWSE, 4 OVERWRITE_CONFIRM, 5 CLOSING_ABORT, 6 CLOSING_COMMIT,
// 7 FIRE_GATE_WAIT, 8 COMMIT_WAIT. Ids 1 and 2 are RETIRED (see `autoload_state.rs`).
//
// THE ROW PRESS OPENS THE LIST (stage 3) AND ASKS NOTHING. It used to open two confirms
// first -- "Are you sure you want to save?" then "Overwrite your loaded save?" (which
// DEFAULTED to Yes) -- which made the user commit to a destination before seeing one.
// Reviewer report, 2026-07-31: "I'd prefer it if when you clicked Save game it took you
// straight to a list of save files ... Prompting to overwrite the current file or not
// every time up front seems like it will lead to more mistakes."
//
// So there is exactly ONE question left, stage 4, and it is asked about a file the user
// has already pointed at: "Are you sure you want to overwrite this file?", default No. A
// destination whose name is FREE is written with no question at all. `[ new ]` is not
// exempt: it computes a leaf, and if that leaf is already taken the pick IS an overwrite
// and confirms like any other.
//
// The tick POLLS the box result (pure reads). Every terminal path runs the proven close
// sequence (OptionSetting immediately, IngameTop deferred 2 frames), and only once the
// menus are closed AND the RAM gates are green does the tick arm the one-shot
// er-save-suppress bypass and fire the FORCED (throttle-skipping) native save request
// pair. The tick only reads and decides; all menu mutation stays on the paths that already
// own it, except the window CLOSE, which the shipping deferred IngameTop close already
// performs from this same game task.
//
// A chosen destination is committed by ARMING a scoped write-open redirect just before the
// fire, so the native writer's own container write lands on the destination while the
// loaded save is only read; stage 8 verifies both files before returning to IDLE. A pick
// that resolves back to the LOADED save takes the sanctioned in-place overwrite instead --
// the only remaining way to overwrite your own save, so that identity check now carries
// the whole "overwrite my current file" use case.

/// This stage's next tick count -- FROZEN while a modal OS file dialog is up.
///
/// Every save-flow deadline derives from `SAVE_FLOW_STAGE_TICKS`, which the game task increments
/// once per frame at exactly one site. The game task runs CONCURRENTLY with the menu/Scaleform
/// pump, so a modal dialog that blocks the pump does not stop the tick: a user browsing folders for
/// twenty seconds would spend ~1200 ticks and watch the destination-browser bound (180), the
/// confirm-box build bound (180) and eventually the commit watchdog (900) all expire underneath
/// them -- pick a file, nothing happens. Freezing this one READ freezes all of them.
///
/// The COUNTER is frozen, not the handlers. An early `return` from `save_flow_tick` would also
/// suspend the event-driven work that must keep running while a dialog is open (a box decision
/// arriving, the writer-idle teardown interlock, the IDLE-tick deferred-teardown sweep); a frozen
/// `ticks` value suspends only the deadlines. That is why this is a frozen read and not a skipped
/// tick.
///
/// Freezing is NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT: stage 3's "abandoned" branch has no tick bound at all,
/// so it needs the separate liveness term in [`dest_browse_verdict`].

///    a bypassed one, so a native request we drop would have been swallowed anyway -- the
///    retraction cannot lose a byte that would otherwise have been written. On the degraded
///    fail-open path (suppression not armed) native saves are real, so we never retract.
/// 2. **No return-title sequence is in flight** (`GameMan+0xbc4 == 0`). The quit chain
///    advances `bc4` 1 -> 2 -> 3 *through* a dispatched save; retracting a request during
///    that window is exactly how System->Quit would hang. `bc4 != 0` means hands off.
/// 3. **The flag was clear before our own fire.** Sampled into
///    `SAVE_FLOW_B72_BEFORE_FIRE`/`_B73_` immediately before the forced pair. A flag the
///    game had already set is not ours and is left set; an unreadable pre-sample is treated
///    as "not ours" too.
/// 4. **No submit was built.** The caller only reaches here after the enqueue grace window
///    expired with the one-shot token unconsumed -- i.e. the dispatcher ran, refused, and
///    nothing downstream ever happened.
///
/// The residual case this cannot separate is a request the game raised *inside* our own
/// fire-to-bailout window: it and ours are one shared byte, and no read can tell them
/// apart. Condition 1 is what makes that acceptable -- that request could not have written
/// anything either -- and the game re-raises its own autosave requests from its own
