//! Per-slot character attribute extraction from a plaintext ER `.sl2`.
//!
//! The ProfileSelect / Load-Game screen shows only a per-slot summary
//! (name/level/map/playtime); the eight attributes exist in no live struct until
//! a slot is actually loaded. To render them per row we read them straight out of
//! the plaintext save slot body (see [`crate::bnd4`]).
//!
//! **The `PlayerGameData` is not at a fixed offset in the slot body** — the
//! variable-length data that precedes it (event flags, inventory, ...) shifts it
//! per slot (offsets from 0xe0b6..0xe8a4 observed across real saves). We locate it
//! by the Elden Ring identity **`RuneLevel == (sum of the 8 attributes) − 79`**,
//! which holds for every class and every level the GAME assigned. All offsets below
//! are relative to the located `PlayerGameData` and were verified against real saves
//! 2026-07-04.
//!
//! That identity is a LOCATOR, not a licence to exist: a stored `level` word can
//! disagree with its own attribute sum (a build importer or save editor that writes
//! one side without the other), and such a character must still decode. See
//! [`slot_stats_from_body`] for the measured case and the structural fallback.
