//! The RAM/pixel semaphores the invasion-warp feature must go green on to be PROVEN.
//!
//! AGENTS.md is explicit: a rendered/behavioural feature is never proven by build success,
//! launch success, "no crash", hook counters, or "the draw task ran". So the oracles are
//! designed HERE, before any runtime exists, and this module is the single place their names
//! and pass conditions are written down.
//!
//! Most of these are NAMES and CONTRACTS, not counters. A counter that is read to emit an
//! oracle but never written reports 0 forever and actively misinforms
//! (`scripts/check-oracle-writers.py`), so each atomic lands in the same change that first
//! WRITES it. Today that is oracle 1 only: [`INVASION_WARP_CATALOG_TARGETS`],
//! [`INVASION_WARP_CATALOG_BLOCKS`] and [`INVASION_WARP_CATALOG_AREAS`] are written by
//! [`crate::sampler`] every time the live singleton is read. Oracles 2-5 stay names until the
//! UI interception that can write them exists.
//!
//! # The proof chain
//!
//! Five oracles, in the order a run must satisfy them. A run that stops early is NEGATIVE or
//! UNPROVEN evidence, never product proof.
//!
//! 1. [`ORACLE_INVASION_WARP_CATALOG_TARGETS`] / [`ORACLE_INVASION_WARP_CATALOG_BLOCKS`] --
//!    the catalog was actually read out of the live `CSAutoInvadePoint`. Pass condition is an
//!    EXACT match against the shipped fingerprints, not "> 0": with only the base container
//!    mounted the totals are 257 blocks / 4482 points, and with `_dlc02` as well 365 / 7073
//!    (`crate::aip::AIP_FINGERPRINT_BASE`, `AIP_FINGERPRINT_DLC02`). A smaller number means
//!    the read raced the loader; a larger one means it double-counted.
//! 2. [`ORACLE_INVASION_WARP_LIST_ROWS`] -- the world-map warp list actually held that many
//!    invasion rows while the dialog was open. Distinguishes "the catalog built" from "the
//!    catalog reached the UI".
//! 3. [`ORACLE_INVASION_WARP_SELECTED_ID`] -- the target identity under the cursor at confirm
//!    time, as [`crate::InvasionWarpTarget::stable_id`]. Must equal the id of the row the
//!    driver moved to; proves the selection index maps to the intended target rather than to
//!    a `BonfireWarpParam` row that happens to sit at the same index.
//! 4. [`ORACLE_INVASION_WARP_REQUESTED_BLOCK`] / [`ORACLE_INVASION_WARP_REQUESTED_POSITION`]
//!    / [`ORACLE_INVASION_WARP_REQUESTED_YAW`] -- what the warp was asked to do. Must equal
//!    the selected target's block and its `world_position(block_origin)`.
//! 5. [`ORACLE_INVASION_WARP_FINAL_BLOCK`] / [`ORACLE_INVASION_WARP_FINAL_POSITION`] -- where
//!    the local player actually ENDED UP, read back from the player instance after the warp
//!    settled. This is the direct objective measurement; 1-4 only prove the request was
//!    formed. Pass condition: same block, and position within
//!    [`INVASION_WARP_POSITION_TOLERANCE_METRES`] of the requested one.
//!
//! # The negative oracle that must stay at zero
//!
//! [`ORACLE_INVASION_WARP_SESSION_TOUCHES`] counts any entry into a session/multiplayer path
//! from this feature. The user's hard boundary is that the feature never fakes an invasion,
//! so "we did not start a session" has to be MEASURED, not asserted. Any non-zero value fails
//! the run outright regardless of how the other five look.
//!
//! [`ORACLE_INVASION_WARP_MSGBOX_BUILDS`] is the standing repo-wide rule restated for this
//! feature: product proof requires zero `CS::MessageBoxDialog` builds.
//!
//! ## Both are UNMEASURED as of the catalog slice, and deliberately have no counter
//!
//! Neither has an `AtomicUsize` yet, and adding one now would be the exact defect this module
//! opens by warning about:
//!
//! * SESSION_TOUCHES would have no writer, because there is no call site to count. The catalog
//!   slice makes exactly one kind of engine access -- a fault-tolerant READ of
//!   `CSAutoInvadePoint` (see [`crate::live_read`]) -- and calls nothing under `CSNetMan` /
//!   `QuickmatchManager` / `CSBreakInPointManager`. A counter incremented from a branch no
//!   reachable code takes reports 0 for a structural reason, not a measured one, and a reader
//!   cannot tell those apart. What DOES carry evidence today is the absence of any such call in
//!   a crate whose only unsafe engine surface is one read -- reviewable, but not a semaphore.
//! * MSGBOX_BUILDS needs either a detour on the `CS::MessageBoxDialog` builder (`0x1409275b0`)
//!   or the passive full-address-space vtable scan `er_telemetry_core::read::dialog_active` runs.
//!   The DLL that hosts this crate installs no detours at all, and the passive scan answers
//!   "a box is on screen", not "THIS feature built one" -- so it could not attribute a hit
//!   even if it were cheap enough to run every tick.
//!
//! [`catalog_oracle_json`] therefore reports both as JSON `null` with
//! `negative_oracles_measured: false`, which a reader cannot mistake for a measured zero.
//! They land with the UI/warp interception that first gives them a call site.
