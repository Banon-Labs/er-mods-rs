//! The local warp itself: put the player at an invasion spawn point.
//!
//! # Which primitive, and why
//!
//! Three candidates were reversed against ER 1.16.2. The plan doc named two of them and chose
//! neither; the one actually used here is the third, and it is the engine's own.
//!
//! * `WarpPlayer` (`0x1405f7ad0`) is **entity-id anchored** -- it moves you to a map's initial
//!   spawn entity, not to a coordinate. Unusable for arbitrary points.
//! * `PlayerIns::Respawn`, the `ChrIns` vtable slot `+0x5a0` (target `0x140657b60`, read out of
//!   the shipped image at `*(u64*)0x142a7d0e0`), does take arbitrary coordinates -- but it
//!   **heals to full and reinitialises SpEffects**, and it performs no map load or streaming
//!   request at all, so a long-distance teleport would drop the player into unstreamed world.
//! * `TriggerAreaReload` (`0x1405f2890`), the EMEVD `Event2003` warp, is an arbitrary-coordinate
//!   warp **with** the load. Its input shape is `BlockId + block-local xyz + euler yaw` --
//!   which is, field for field, the `.aip` record this crate already decodes. That is the one
//!   replicated here.
//!
//! `TriggerAreaReload` itself always reloads the *current* map, so it cannot be called directly;
//! what this module does is run its exact sequence with our destination and our coordinates
//! substituted for the "where I am standing now" values it derives.
//!
//! # Why the coordinates are handed over untouched
//!
//! `MoveMapStep`'s spawn resolver (`FUN_140afcf60`) reads the explicit-spawn slot and calls
//! `ConvertBlockCoordsToPhysicsCoords` on it *itself*. So the block-local `.aip` xyz goes in
//! raw: converting first would double-apply the block origin.
//!
//! # Hard boundary
//!
//! One session-manager call exists in this sequence and it is **vanilla**: `TriggerAreaReload`
//! calls `CSSessionManagerImp::SetupMapReentry` when `protocolState == InGame`, on every EMEVD
//! warp in the game. Omitting a step the engine always performs is how a reload softlocks, so
//! it is replicated -- and [`WarpOutcome::session_touches`] **counts** it rather than pretending
//! the number is zero. Nothing here starts, fakes or spoofs invasion/multiplayer state; no
//! `CSNetMan`, `QuickmatchManager` or `CSBreakInPointManager` code is entered.
//!
//! Every RVA below is byte-checked against `eldenring-deobf.bin` at shift 0
//! (`python3 scripts/check-dump-deobf-identity.py --count 32 0x<va>`); see
//! `docs/plans/world-map-invasion-warp.md`.
