//! Loading [`LocalInvasionConfig`] from `er-invasion-warp-core.toml`, and RELOADING it while the game
//! runs.
//!
//! # Hot reload, and why it is content-polled rather than event-driven
//!
//! The user edits this file to change where they are hunting -- or which key marks a location --
//! mid-session, and expects the next match and the next keypress to follow the new rules. A watcher
//! API (ReadDirectoryChangesW, inotify) would be more elegant and is the wrong tool here: it needs
//! a thread and a handle owned by a DLL that can be unloaded, and it fires on events we do not care
//! about. Polling is not a compromise here; it is the cheaper correct thing.
//!
//! It polls the file's TEXT (`er_hotkey_config::HotFile`), not its mtime, which is what it used to
//! do. mtime has one-second resolution on several filesystems -- including the kind a Wine prefix
//! sits on -- so two saves inside one second lost the second one, which reads as the edit not
//! working. And a `touch`, a re-save with no changes, or this DLL's own write-back of a mark all
//! moved mtime without changing anything, each of which was reported as a reload. That matters more
//! now than it did: a reload RESETS the key edge detectors, so a spurious one makes a key held at
//! that instant fire.
//!
//! # Parsing without a TOML dependency
//!
//! This crate is `no-std`-adjacent in spirit and is compiled into a DLL that already avoids
//! pulling weight it does not need. The schema is a handful of scalars and one string array, so it
//! is parsed directly. The parser is deliberately STRICT about unknown keys and bad values --
//! reporting them rather than ignoring them -- because a typo in a filter that cancels other
//! players' matches should be visible, not silently inert.
//!
//! # Composition
//!
//! [`parse_local_invasion_config`] takes the file's text and nothing else, so the same schema can
//! be read out of a shared TOML when this crate is used as a library alongside others: hand it the
//! `[local_invasion]` section's body and it behaves identically. [`SECTION_NAME`] is exported for
//! that purpose.

# Seamless decides WHERE an invasion sends you, server-side, and tells the client. This filter

# are not where you want to be. Cancelling is safe: the session returns to idle and searching
# continues. Nothing here fakes an invasion or spoofs session state.
#
# EDITS TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. The file is re-read about once a second while the game runs; no
# restart. The log names what changed each time.

# Master switch. OFF by default -- this cancels real matches, so it has to be asked for.
enabled = false

# How a destination is judged:
#   "exact" -- only the exact location you are anchored to.
#   "area"  -- that exact location, or anywhere sharing one of its place names. If where you stand
#              carries one name, that is one place to look; if it carries five, five.
#   "named" -- ignore where you are; accept only the locations listed below.
#
# OPEN YOUR WORLD MAP ONCE per session if you use "area" or "named". Place names are read off the
# world map's own rows, so before you have opened it no location has a name, every name-based
# judgement fails closed, and both modes behave like "exact". The log says so the first time it
# happens. "exact" compares locations directly and never needs the map.
mode = "exact"

# HUNT MODE -- ask Steam for ONE location instead of rejecting what it sends.
#
# The filter above DECLINES matches: it sees every host and cancels the ones you do not want, which
# always works but can take many tries. Hunt instead narrows the QUERY, so the answer arrives right
# the first time.
#
# The cost, and why this is separate and off by default: it filters on a key only this DLL
# publishes, so while hunt is on you will NOT see hosts who are not running it. Your friend needs
# it too. Leave it off to keep meeting everybody.
#
# A Steam filter tests ONE value and has no OR, so hunt uses the single marked location if you have
# marked exactly one, or the map you are standing in if you have marked none. Several marked
# locations cannot be expressed and hunt will say so and stay out of the way.
hunt = false

# Announce a rejection on the game's own message banner ("Rejected invasion: m60_42_36_00").
#
# Only a CHANGE of wrong destination is announced. Seamless retries roughly every 20 seconds and
# the same wrong place comes back around constantly, so announcing every one would be wallpaper
# within a minute. Silence after the first means "still being sent to the same wrong place".
reject_notice = false

# Match ONLY other players running this DLL with this option turned on.
#
# Seamless finds worlds with a `lobby_key` that is a fingerprint of your game's params and Seamless
# build -- NOT your co-op password. This rewrites that key into a pool of our own, and because one
# value drives both the search and the advertisement, the separation is symmetric: vanilla players
# cannot see you and you cannot see them.
#
# It is ABSOLUTE, not a preference. While this is on, the entire vanilla population is invisible to
# you for hosting AND for invading -- you will only ever meet other people running this DLL with
# this same option on. Turn it on for a session with friends, not permanently.
dll_users_only = false

# THE TWO USEFUL COMBINATIONS, since these switches are independent:
#
#   enabled = true,  dll_users_only = false   filter by LOCATION, meet everybody (the default use)
#   enabled = false, dll_users_only = true    invade ANYWHERE as normal, but only ever meet other
#                                             DLL users -- a private global community
#
# Both together works too: only DLL users, and only at the place you are standing.

# NOT IMPLEMENTED YET -- anything listed here is parsed and then ignored, and the log says so on
# every load. Turning a typed place name into the FMG text id the game matches on has not been
# reversed, so there is nothing to compare a string against.
#
# Use Shift+Insert instead: stand somewhere, press it, and every location sharing that place's name
# is accepted from then on. That writes `named_location_text_ids` below, which IS consulted.
#
# Be careful with mode = "named": if this list is the only thing you filled in, no ids exist and
# EVERY match is rejected.
named_locations = []

# Locations you marked, and the two lists the in-game keys write to. Both WIDEN whatever `mode`

#   Shift+unmark_key un-mark those
#
# The world map colours its invasion pins by these two lists, and by nothing else: chosen is the
# brightest marker, excluded the dimmest, and anything in neither list keeps the middle one. That
# is a property of the LOCATION, so the map reads the same wherever you are standing.
#
# The keys rewrite this file, so marks survive a restart. Hand-edits are equally fine; the file is
# re-read about once a second while you play.

# Case and spacing do not matter. A raw virtual-key code works too ("0x2d"). A name this file does
