//! What destination a Seamless invasion actually chose, read straight out of `CSGameMan`.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Seamless Co-op does not use retail matchmaking and does not use the `.aip` / MSB
//! `InvasionPoint` tables this crate's map surface is built from -- none of `ersc.dll`'s 286
//! resolved signature slots reach `CSBreakInPointManager` or `CS::QuickmatchManager`. So the
//! pins cannot tell anyone where a Seamless invader will land, and reading `ersc.dll` cannot
//! either: the code that picks a target sits inside the ~3.4% of its `.text` that Themida
//! encrypted.
//!
//! What IS readable is the answer, after the fact. An invader's destination is not a coordinate
//! -- it is an MSB **entry-point entity ID** plus a destination map, and both are handed to the
//! engine through `CSGameMan` where anything can read them. One invasion therefore tells us what
//! the encrypted code decided, which is the fact the static analysis could not produce.
//!
//! # Offsets, each byte-verified against `eldenring-deobf.bin` via its own named getter
//!
//! | field | offset | getter |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | entry-point entity id | `+0xaf0` | `GetNpcInvadeTargetEntryPoint` `0x140679650` |
//! | destination block id  | `+0xac8` | `GetTargetMapId` `0x140679630` |
//! | rapid-reentry flag    | `+0xafc` | `ShouldUseRapidReentry` `0x14067a150` |
//!
//! All three are `mov rax,[0x143d69918]` followed by a load at their offset, so the singleton
//! pointer is confirmed three times over. `FUN_140afcf60` -- the spawn resolver `ersc.dll` hooks
//! at `0x140af9d20` -- calls the first two, which is what puts these fields on the placement path
//! rather than merely near it.
//!
//! This module only READS. It never writes `CSGameMan` and never calls into the engine, because
//! the point is to find out what Seamless does, and a probe that perturbs the thing it measures
//! answers a different question.
