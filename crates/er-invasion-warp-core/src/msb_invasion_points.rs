//! Invasion spawn points for the maps the `.aip` table does not cover.
//!
//! # Why a second source exists at all
//!
//! `other:/AutoInvadePoint.aipbnd` holds 7073 points across 365 blocks -- and every one of them is
//! in area **60** (Lands Between overworld) or **61** (Shadow Lands). Leyndell, Stormveil, Farum
//! Azula, the Haligtree, every cave, catacomb and tunnel have **no `.aip` entries whatsoever**, so
//! a map surface built only from that table can never show a marker in them.
//!
//! That is not an oversight in the shipped data. The engine selects between two entirely separate
//! mechanisms on a param bit: `CS::PlayRegionParamLookupResult::isAutoIntrudePoint`
//! (`0x140d44a20`) returns `_PLAY_REGION_PARAM_ST` byte `0x45` bit 0. Of the 593 `PlayRegionParam`
//! rows in the shipped `regulation.bin`, exactly **90** have that bit set, and all 90 are area 60,
//! area 61, or an `areaNo == 0` row whose id sits in the 6100000..=6941010 overworld band. Every
//! row for areas 10..=45 has it clear. `CSBreakInPointManager` accordingly has two consumers:
//!
//! * `_GetCurBreakInPointVecFromAutoIntrudePoint` (`0x140a0c4f0`) -- the `.aip` path, and
//! * `FUN_140a0c100` (`0x140a0c100`) -- the general path, which enumerates **MSB `POINT_PARAM_ST`
//!   regions of subtype `InvasionPoint`** out of each resident map.
//!
//! This module is the second one. An offline harvest of all 1347 shipped MSBs found **2807**
//! `InvasionPoint` regions across 113 maps, 2596 of them outside the overworld (Leyndell 168,
//! Farum Azula 119, Volcano Manor 115, Stormveil 94, Haligtree 88, catacombs 285, caves 229,
//! the m12 underground 399, ...). That harvest is a CHECK, never the product's data: per the
//! project rule the surface must reflect what is actually loaded, because a mod can rewrite it.
//!
//! # Why the catalog accumulates instead of being read once
//!
//! `.aip` is a single global table (`CSAutoInvadePoint`) that is resident for the whole session,
//! so it can be read once and be complete. MSB point data is **per map**, lives on that map's
//! `MsbResCap`, and is evicted when the map unloads. There is no moment at which every map's
//! points are simultaneously readable. So a complete-in-one-read design is not merely awkward
//! here, it is impossible.
//!
//! What is possible is to read whichever maps are resident right now and *remember* them. Every
//! visit adds coverage and nothing is ever lost, so the surface strictly improves as the session
//! goes on. The alternative -- resolving non-resident maps by reading their MSB through the
//! engine's own virtual file system -- is a larger piece of work and is deliberately not attempted
//! here; this type is the accumulator either path needs.
//!
//! Nothing in this module is a multiplayer call. `CSBreakInPointManager` is where session state
//! lives and it is not entered: the point geometry is read, the same way the `.aip` table is.
