//! The dependency-injection seam between this feature crate and its host DLL.
//!
//! Same pattern as `er_loading_portrait_core::host` and `er_quit_menu_core::host`: function pointers
//! installed once at DLL attach, neutral defaults until then, crate-internal wrappers
//! bearing the names the feature code calls. Until a host installs, every seam answers a
//! neutral default (logging is a no-op, the feature gate is off), so the crate is INERT
//! rather than wrong.
//!
//! # Why this seam is small
//!
//! The repo rule is that a seam entry is legitimate only when a consumer OUTSIDE the feature
//! genuinely needs the thing; a cross-call whose consumers all live inside the feature is a
//! MOVE, not a seam entry. This feature is self-contained -- it reads one engine singleton
//! and owns its own catalog -- so the only things that genuinely cross are the host's log
//! sink and the host's decision that the feature is on at all. Nothing here reaches back
//! into `er-quickload`, and nothing may be added speculatively: an entry lands with the
//! slice that first calls it.
