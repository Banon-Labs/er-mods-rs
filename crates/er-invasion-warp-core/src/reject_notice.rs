//! Decides when a rejection is worth putting on screen, and what it should say.
//!
//! Kept separate from the code that displays it so the policy can be tested on a host with no game
//! attached. The display side is a game-thread call into `CSPopupMenu`; this half is arithmetic.
//!
//! # Why this is not simply "one banner per rejection"
//!
//! Measured 2026-08-06: Seamless retries roughly every 20 seconds, and during a hunt in a busy
//! bracket most of those retries end in a rejection at the same wrong place — the same host, or
//! the same popular area, coming back around. A banner every time would be wallpaper within a
//! minute, and a notification the player learns to ignore is worse than none: it costs screen space
//! and teaches them the mod is noisy.
//!
//! So a place is announced when it is new relative to the last thing announced, and consecutive
//! rejections at that same place stay silent. Moving to a different wrong place is genuinely new
//! information and is announced again, including a return to somewhere announced earlier — the
//! player's question is "where am I being sent right now", not "where have I ever been sent".
