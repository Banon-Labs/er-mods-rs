//! Standalone "apply one SpEffect to every loaded enemy" toggle DLL.
//!
//! Press the configured hotkey in-game and every enemy currently loaded is put under the
//! configured `effect_id` (Charming Branch by default, but any SpEffectParam row works -- the
//! shipped config uses `[Incantation] Darkness`); while the toggle is on, any enemy that is not
//! under it -- one that just
//! spawned, or one whose 180 seconds ran out -- is put back under it on the next frame. Press it
//! again and the effect is stripped back off.
//!
//! Ships as its own `er_enemynpc_effects.dll`, listed as its own ME3 `[[natives]]` entry. It shares
//! no state with the product DLL and hooks nothing but DirectInput's keyboard read.
