// hook union (2026-07-16, user-directed). MinHook binds one detour per address,
// so two features hooking the same game function silently drop one -- the native-
// Windows menu race. This unions them: the first feature to hook an address installs
// a single dispatcher detour (from a fixed pool, so no runtime codegen) that owns the
// real trampoline; every feature's handler is chained by pointing its existing `orig`
// slot at the next handler, with the last handler's `orig` = the real game trampoline.
// A handler that calls its orig now calls the next handler in the chain (or the game),
// so existing handlers work unchanged and no handler is ever silently dropped.
//
// Constraint: the shared signature is `extern "system" fn(usize,usize,usize,usize)->usize`
// -- correct for the integer/pointer <=4-arg game functions we contend on (menu/dialog
// Run/activate/build). Not for float-arg targets at any arity: an integer dispatcher
// receives and forwards no `xmm` register, so a target taking a float is handed whatever the
// caller happened to leave in `xmm1`. That exclusion is unchanged by the five-argument path
// below, and `dlstring_lookat_math.rs`, `er-npc-possess/src/hud/detour.rs`,
// `er-invasion-warp/src/announce.rs` and `install_title_update_hook` record the hooks that stay
// on a bare `MhHook` because of it.
//
// # A handler is the dispatcher's arity exactly, not at most it
//
// This paragraph used to read "a handler using fewer args just ignores the extras; unused
// register args are harmless", and that is true only of a handler that is alone on its address
// -- which is the one case the union does not exist for. Chaining is what breaks it:
// `register_union_hook_resolved` stores the new handler's address into the previous handler's
// `orig` slot, so a narrow handler calling its orig through the game's own narrower signature
// leaves `r8`/`r9` unset for the next handler and returns nothing for one whose return the game
// uses. Twenty-seven handlers were written to the old sentence and twenty-three addresses ended
// up carrying handlers that disagreed about arity, four of them inside `er_quickload.dll` alone
// (`0x746e80`, `0x67b200`, `0x67b290`, `0xb0d960`) where no second module is needed to chain.
// The safety contract on [`register_shared_hook`] already stated the rule; this is the same rule
// stated where a handler author reads it first, and `scripts/check-union-hook-abi.py` enforces
// it. A game function that genuinely takes fewer arguments is unharmed: the extra registers are
// the caller's own, forwarded verbatim instead of left as the handler's scratch.
//
// # Five arguments, added 2026-09-10, as a parallel path rather than a widening
//
// [`UnionFn`] is four arguments, and where a target really takes five that alias is a silent
// lie. In the Microsoft x64 convention the fifth argument is a stack slot the caller writes
// at `[rsp+0x20]`; a four-argument dispatcher never allocates or writes it, so a
// five-argument callee reached through one reads whatever the caller happened to leave above
// its 32-byte home area. Worse than a wrong integer: for `AddCancelButton` the fifth argument
// is a function pointer the game calls. This is the same failure class as the world block
// ctor at `0x62ec00`, which `menu_trace_hooks.rs` records as runtime-proven on 2026-07-17 --
// stack args lost by a four-register forwarding hook, access violation.
//
// The `AddCancelButton` row cloner (`system_quit_duplicate_add_cancel_button_hook`, five
// arguments) is the concrete case, and it is why that hook could not use the union at all and
// installed a bare [`MhHook`] instead -- which is the trampoline-corruption hazard the union
// exists to remove.
//
// Widening [`UnionFn`] in place was rejected: 270 references across 39 files would have to be
// re-typed for one caller, putting every shipped cdylib in the blast radius. So [`UnionFn5`]
// is a second signature with its own dispatcher pool, and the four-argument handlers compile
// untouched.
//
// One address is one arity, enforced rather than raced. Both pools index the same slot table,
// so a target already union-owned at one arity is refused at the other by [`union_admission`]
// before MinHook is touched. Two dispatchers on one prologue is not a contest worth having:
// MinHook binds one detour per address, so the second `MH_CreateHook` would come back
// `MH_ERROR_ALREADY_CREATED` and one arity's handlers would silently never run -- the exact
// failure mode this whole module was built to delete.

// That is measured, not hypothetical. `er-quickload` and `er-armament-icons` both detour
// `TITLE_SCALEFORM_FILE_OPEN_RVA` (0x11ced80); in an eleven-native profile the product reported
// `file_open_observer_installed = true` with `file_open_hits = 0` for an entire session and every

// build gate (2026-08-28). Every game address in this workspace is a 1.16.2 RVA. ELDEN RING 1.17
// moved code, and a detour installed at a stale RVA does not fail -- it lands mid-function and
// corrupts the game: `0x1407ada40` is a real prologue in 1.16.2 and `xor r15d, r15d` in 1.17, and
// hooking it killed a boot with an access violation whose backtrace blames game code.
//
// MinHook cannot catch this. It refuses only what it cannot decode (several hooks did come back
// MH_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION on 1.17); mid-function bytes that happen to decode are installed
// happily. So the check has to be "is this the build these addresses came from", asked once, here,
// where every detour in every DLL of this workspace passes through.
//
// Scope is the detour installers plus the two RVA-taking byte primitives. `patch_3byte_stub` and
// `apply_xor_ret_stub` were ungated until 2026-08-30 on the theory that validating the overwritten
// byte was gate enough; it is not. They take a 1.16.2 `rva`, and on 1.17 all three call sites hit a
// byte that is simply different, so each aborted reporting a signature mismatch while the map knew
// exactly where the function had gone. They now resolve first and refuse when nothing knows.
//
// `write_code_byte` stays ungated on purpose: it takes an absolute address that its callers
// discover themselves, so there is no RVA to translate and a gate could only refuse work that is
// already version-agnostic. The caller that established this was `er-ersc-sigshim`, retired
// 2026-09-03 with support for old Seamless builds; the property is about the argument, not it.

/// * a translated address -- the running build moved the function, and this pair was verified as
///   the same function: `scripts/map-rvas-1162-to-1170.py` found it by masked signature and
///   `scripts/verify-rva-map-1170.py` then confirmed the normalised instruction sequences are
///   identical over the body, not just the prologue;
/// * `None` -- the build moved the function and nothing here knows where to. Refusing is the only
///   safe answer: `0x1407ada40` is a real prologue in 1.16.2 and `xor r15d, r15d` in 1.17, and
