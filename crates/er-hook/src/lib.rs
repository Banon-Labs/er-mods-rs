// ============================================================================
// BUILD GATE (2026-08-28). Every game address in this workspace is a 1.16.2 RVA. ELDEN RING 1.17
// moved code, and a detour installed at a stale RVA does not fail -- it lands mid-function and
// corrupts the game: `0x1407ada40` is a real prologue in 1.16.2 and `xor r15d, r15d` in 1.17, and
// hooking it killed a boot with an access violation whose backtrace blames game code.
//
// MinHook cannot catch this. It refuses only what it cannot DECODE (several hooks did come back
// MH_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION on 1.17); mid-function bytes that happen to decode are installed
// happily. So the check has to be "is this the build these addresses came from", asked once, here,
// where every detour in every DLL of this workspace passes through.
//
// Scope is the DETOUR installers plus the two RVA-taking byte primitives. `patch_3byte_stub` and
// `apply_xor_ret_stub` were ungated until 2026-08-30 on the theory that validating the overwritten
// byte was gate enough; it is not. They take a 1.16.2 `rva`, and on 1.17 all three call sites hit a
// byte that is simply different, so each aborted reporting a signature mismatch while the map knew
// exactly where the function had gone. They now resolve first and REFUSE when nothing knows.
//
// `write_code_byte` stays ungated on purpose: it takes an ABSOLUTE address that its callers
// discover themselves, so there is no RVA to translate and a gate could only refuse work that is
// already version-agnostic. The caller that established this was `er-ersc-sigshim`, retired
// 2026-09-03 with support for old Seamless builds; the property is about the argument, not it.
// ============================================================================

///   outside the game image (a Win32 detour, correct on every build);
/// * a TRANSLATED address -- the running build moved the function, and this pair was verified as
///   the same function: `scripts/map-rvas-1162-to-1170.py` found it by masked signature and
///   `scripts/verify-rva-map-1170.py` then confirmed the normalised instruction sequences are
///   identical over the body, not just the prologue;
/// * `None` -- the build moved the function and nothing here knows where to. Refusing is the only
///   safe answer: `0x1407ada40` is a real prologue in 1.16.2 and `xor r15d, r15d` in 1.17, and

// RAW CODE-PATCH PRIMITIVES (moved from `er-quickload/src/experiments/mem.rs`,
// docs/plans/experiments-crate-targets.md S5). Behaviour-preserving move: the bodies are the
// product's, and every log string is unchanged. They belong here because they are the same
// "reach into the game image and rewrite bytes" capability MinHook itself provides, and both
// consumers (the product DLL and er-title-flow) already depend on this crate -- so hosting them
// here deletes the two `TitleFlowHost` fn-pointer seams that existed only to reach back into the
// product for them.
//
// Kept as two functions rather than one because their log text differs and this is a MOVE, not a
// redesign. `apply_xor_ret_stub` is `patch_3byte_stub` plus a success line and an
// "online-disable"-prefixed abort line; deduping them changes what a diagnostic log says and is
// deliberately left for a separate slice.
//
// The `windows` crate is NOT pulled in for this -- er-hook has zero `[dependencies]` and keeps it
// that way, following the raw-extern pattern already used above for `GetModuleHandleExW` and the
// `MH_*` family.
