//! Is this address a legitimate place to write into the RUNNING image?
//!
//! # The question the version gate cannot answer
//!
//! `er_game_base::game_build::resolve_detour_address` answers "where did this 1.16.2 address go on
//! the running build". That is the right question for an address that came from a constant, and it
//! is a question with no meaning for an address the caller found by SCANNING the running image --
//! an AOB hit, a function pointer read out of a live vtable. Those addresses are already correct
//! for the build in front of them; asking the table where they moved to gets a REFUSAL, because
//! the table is keyed by 1.16.2 RVAs and a 1.17 address is not one of its keys.
//!
//! Measured 2026-08-30: `er-armament-icons` and `er-invasion-warp` both locate the GFx tag-parse
//! function by a unique 30-byte `.text` signature -- *precisely because* hardcoded RVAs drift
//! between patches -- and the scan is CORRECT on 1.17 (`0x1411cf1a0` -> `0x1411d0fa0`,
//! byte-identical body, `.pdata` extent `0x68` in both images). Both then handed the hit to the
//! translating installer, which refused it, and both features were off on a build where the
//! address was right all along. The one mechanism built to survive a patch was the one the
//! migration gate turned off.
//!
//! # What replaces translation, because something must
//!
//! Skipping translation must not mean skipping validation. A wrong absolute address is exactly as
//! fatal as a stale one: MinHook overwrites five bytes, and five bytes written into the middle of
//! a live function corrupt the image with no error anywhere.
//!
//! So a runtime-derived address is checked against the running image's OWN function table -- the
//! `.pdata` exception directory, which the linker wrote and which the OS itself binary-searches on
//! every unwind. Three answers, and the middle one is the whole reason this module exists:
//!
//! * `Entry` -- `.pdata` declares a function start exactly here. Hook it.
//! * `Leaf` -- no `.pdata` record covers it. The x64 ABI lets a function omit unwind data when it
//!   allocates no stack and calls nothing, so the game's many small getters and `jmp` thunks have
//!   no record at all. Hooking one is fine, and refusing them would throw away a large, legitimate
//!   population -- including `ONLINE_DISABLE_RVA` (`0x67a030`), a LEAF in 1.16.2.
//! * `MidFunction` -- the address is INSIDE some other function's declared extent. Refuse.
//!
//! # Why the middle of a function is the case worth a whole module
//!
//! Because it verifies beautifully. A mid-function address sits in the middle of a stable
//! neighbourhood, so every similarity metric agrees at length about the wrong thing:
//! `scripts/classify-1170-entry-kind.py` records six such addresses reaching or nearly reaching
//! the verified map on 2026-08-30, each `IDENTICAL` over 20-94 instructions. `0x140aec480` scored
//! `IDENTICAL 1.000` over 56 instructions and is `+0x360` inside `0x140aec120..0x140aec567`. That
//! script is this check's offline twin, run against the image files; this is the same question
//! asked of the image that is actually loaded, which is the only image a runtime caller can be
//! wrong about.
//!
//! The four stale stub targets are the other half of the demonstration. On 1.17, at their
//! unchanged 1.16.2 RVAs, `0x67a030`, `0xe56310`, `0x24129b0` and `0x240f490` are ALL
//! MID-FUNCTION -- and three of the four open with a byte that passes their caller's one-byte
//! signature check, because `0x40`/`0x48`/`0x4c` are REX prefixes and the image is full of them.
