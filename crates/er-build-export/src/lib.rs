//! Produce an `er-build-planner` `?i=` share link, entirely offline.
//!
//! This is the write half of what `er-build-import` reads, and it is a different problem.
//! A `?b=` link is an id the planner resolves server-side, so writing one would mean holding
//! an account and posting a build. A `?i=` link is *self-contained*: the whole character
//! document is compressed into the URL, so it can be produced from nothing but the document,
//! by anyone, with no network at all. That is the link this crate emits.
//!
//! # The pipeline
//!
//! Transcribed from the live site bundle -- `serialise() { return zc(btoa(JSON.stringify(
//! this.character))) }` and the `zc` it calls -- and verified against the site's own decoder.
//! In order:
//!
//! 1. [`ascii_json`] -- `JSON.stringify(character)`, with every non-ASCII character escaped
//!    as `\uXXXX`. See [`json_ascii`] for why this crate escapes where the site cannot.
//! 2. [`base64::encode`] -- `btoa` of that ASCII text.
//! 3. [`substitute_json_tokens`] -- the site's three JSON-shorthand substitutions, which are
//!    provably no-ops on base64 and are applied anyway; see that function.
//! 4. [`lzutf8::compress`] then [`base64::encode`] again -- `LZUTF8.compress(text, {
//!    outputEncoding: "Base64" })`, i.e. the compressed *bytes*, base64'd.
//! 5. [`to_url_alphabet`] -- the URL-safe substitution and two legacy prefix rewrites.
//! 6. [`SHARE_URL_PREFIX`] in front.
//!
//! ```
//! use er_build_export::{model::BuildExportDoc, share_url, SHARE_URL_PREFIX};
//!
//! let mut doc = BuildExportDoc::with_level(150, false);
//! doc.name = "Occult Mage".to_string();
//! doc.stats.intelligence = 36;
//!
//! let url = share_url(&doc);
//! assert!(url.starts_with(SHARE_URL_PREFIX));
//! ```
//!
//! # Testability
//!
//! Every stage above is a public function taking and returning plain data, so each can be
//! pinned on its own. On top of that sit three end-to-end checks, in descending order of
//! authority and ascending order of availability:
//!
//! * `tests/reference_decoder.rs` -- the site's **actual** decoder, run under Node over the
//!   finished payload, asserting the recovered JSON is byte-identical. The real gate. Skips
//!   when Node or the extracted bundle is absent.
//! * `tests/python_decoder.rs` -- `scripts/decode-build-link.py`, an independently written
//!   decoder that lives in this repository. Compares parsed documents rather than bytes.
//!   Skips when Python or the script is absent.
//! * `tests/pipeline.rs` and `tests/lzutf8_roundtrip.rs` -- pure Rust, against a decoder
//!   transcribed from the reference implementation. Never skip, so `cargo test` is still
//!   meaningful on a machine with no interpreter at all.
