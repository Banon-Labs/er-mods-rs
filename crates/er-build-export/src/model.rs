//!
//! [`crate::model`] is the mirror image of `er_build_import_core::model`: that one models the
//! *subset* a reader needs and ignores everything else, because an upstream field addition
//! must not fail a parse. A writer cannot afford the same laxity. The planner's
//! `importState` merges the incoming object into the live character with a helper that sets
//! any key **missing from the source** to `undefined`, so a key this crate omits is not
//! defaulted -- it is erased, and the planner then reads `undefined.slots` and dies. Every
//! key of the planner's own `makeDefault()` is therefore modelled here, defaulted here, and
//! always emitted.
//!
//! Two keys are omitted on purpose, and only these two: `computed` (the planner recomputes
//! it from scratch on its next save) and `activeEffects` (read with `?.`, so `undefined` is
//! a value it already handles). Both are large, both are derived, and neither survives a
//! round trip anyway.
//!
//! The defaults below are transcribed from the live bundle's
//! `static makeDefault(e=0,t=!1)`, not invented.
