//! The acceptance gate: the **site's own decoder** must recover our document.
//!
//! Everything else in this crate is a claim about the format. This is the only test that
//! checks the claim against the code the planner actually runs -- `Bc`, the exact inverse of
//! the `zc` that `serialise()` calls -- by handing it a payload this crate produced and
//! asserting `JSON.parse(atob(Bc(payload)))` deep-equals the document we started from. That
//! expression is not an approximation of the planner's import path; it is copied out of
//! `loadFromSerialised`.
//!
//! It needs two things this repository does not carry: a `node` on PATH, and an extracted
//! copy of the planner's LZ-UTF8 bundle. Neither is versioned here -- the bundle is
//! third-party minified JavaScript pulled from a live site, and the point of a reference
//! decoder is that it is *theirs*, so vendoring a copy that then drifts would defeat it. So
//! this test SKIPS, loudly, when either is missing, exactly like the game-asset corpus tests
//! in `er-gfx`. Point `ER_LZUTF8_REFERENCE_JS` at the bundle to run it.
