//! The appearance, end to end: a character's own `FaceDataBuffer` out through the encoder, back
//! through the independent decoder and the importer's reader, and written over a fresh buffer.
//!
//! # Why this is the test the old key never had
//!
//! The document used to carry a `faceData` key: the whole 288-byte buffer as hex. It was written,
//! stored, and echoed back byte for byte -- and none of that was evidence of anything, because
//! nothing ever read it. "The hex survives" only proved a string round-tripped through a string.
//!
//! What has to be true now is that the **bytes** come back, having been taken apart into two
//! hundred named sliders by a layout a second program chose and put together again. A test that
//! only checked the sliders object would miss an offset error; a test that only checked the bytes
//! on one pass would miss a codec that dropped a field symmetrically. So this runs the whole
//! chain -- encoder, independent decoder, importer's reader, encoder again -- and differences the
//! buffer at both ends.
