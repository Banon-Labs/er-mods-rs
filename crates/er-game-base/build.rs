//! Bakes the commit this build came from into `er-game-base`, for `build_id`.
//!
//! # Why the git sha and not a version string
//!
//! Every crate in this workspace is `version = "0.1.0"`, so the manifest version identifies
//! nothing. The question a log has to answer is "which SOURCE produced the binary that wrote
//! this line", and the only honest answer is a commit id plus whether the tree was clean.
//!
//! # Why `dirty` is load-bearing
//!
//! A sha alone invites a false certainty: `git show <sha>` looks authoritative, but if the
//! build came from a tree with uncommitted edits, that diff is NOT what ran. `+dirty` is the
//! flag that stops someone reading the wrong source with total confidence.
//!
//! # The staleness this cannot fully close
//!
//! `rerun-if-changed` on `.git/HEAD`, the ref it names, and `.git/index` catches commits,
//! checkouts and `git add`. It does NOT catch a bare edit to a tracked file that is never
//! staged -- cargo has no reason to rebuild this crate for that, so the `+dirty` suffix can
//! be absent from a build whose tree had edits. That is why the runtime line pairs this with the DLL's
//! own PE timestamp, which is written by the linker on every relink and cannot go stale.

///
/// * it discards a function SHORTER than the floor even when the comparison was complete. Five
///   leaves of 3 to 13 instructions verified at ratio 1.000 over their entire bodies and were
///   dropped anyway, taking the Seamless null-container guard (`0x4f9940`) with them;
/// * it waves through a PREFIX of a long function. `STEP_MoveMap` matched over 120 instructions
///   of 975, cleared this floor comfortably, and was promoted to detour-safe -- while the two
///   instructions 1.17 inserted sat at index 873.
///
/// So it does not apply to a verdict in [`EXHAUSTIVE_VERDICTS`], where the comparison covered
/// every instruction of both bodies and found them the same length. That is not a longer prefix,
/// it is a different claim, and there is no next instruction for a floor to insure against.

/// rescued row would quietly go back to being discarded, so change them together.
///
/// * `BYTE-IDENTICAL` -- both `.pdata` extents, byte for byte, unchanged.
/// * `IDENTICAL-WHOLE` -- both `.pdata` extents, normalised instruction streams equal over all of
///   them, and the two extents the same length.
/// * `IDENTICAL-LEAF` -- the same, for a function neither image declares in `.pdata` at all. The
///   x64 ABI omits unwind data for a function that allocates no stack and calls nothing, so
///   ELDEN RING's small getters simply have no entry and no extent can be read; the verifier
///   decodes the end instead, and three facts back that decode -- it stops on a real terminator
///   past every forward branch target, the two images decoded separately arrive at the SAME byte
