// branches independently moved the same constants into two different new crates: er-title-flow
// (the autoload/title-flow slice) and er-diag-harness / er-quit-menu-core (already on main).

// Its own prescription is followed here: declare the value ONCE, cross-cutting singletons in
// this file, and derive every other name from it. One address, one literal.
