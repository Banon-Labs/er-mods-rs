//! Tier A: stable singleton RVA / offset table (game 1.16.x, image base
//! 0x140000000). These are version-anchored facts shared by all three DLLs;
//! they were previously re-declared under ~4 different aliases in the product
//! `constants/*` tree and hand-copied verbatim into the two mini-DLLs. This is
//! the single source of truth.
//!
//! Feature-specific / experiment-local offsets do NOT belong here — only the
//! cross-cutting singleton globals + their generic field offsets.
