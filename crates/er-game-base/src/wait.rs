//! Wait for a game singleton to exist without deadlocking the process that is building it.
//!
//! # The failure this replaces
//!
//! Every shell in this workspace opens the same way: spawn a thread, then
//!
//! ```ignore
//! loop {
//!     match unsafe { CSTaskImp::instance() } {
//!         Ok(task) => break task,
//!         Err(_) => std::thread::yield_now(),
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! On a build where the singleton turns up promptly that loop runs a handful of times and nobody
//! notices. On 1.17 it does not turn up promptly, and the loop becomes an unbounded stream of
//! `NtYieldExecution` calls. Under Wine every one of those is a round trip to the wineserver,
//! which is shared and serialising, so a couple of these threads is enough to starve every OTHER
//! thread in the process -- including the game's.
//!
//! MEASURED, 2026-08-29. Full profile, eighteen DLLs. Three minutes after launch the game had
//! accumulated 104 CPU ticks -- about one second of work -- while `er-telemetry-standalone` and
//! `er-invasion-path` had 19,380 and 19,348 each, roughly half of it system time. Fifty-nine game
//! threads sat in `S`, the main thread blocked in `anon_pipe_read` on the wineserver, and around
//! thirty of our own threads had never been scheduled at all (`cpu=0`). No window, no crash, no
//! log line after +124 ms. Relaunching with those two shells excluded and nothing else changed
//! took the same build from 104 ticks to `boot-view: first draw onto backbuffer 3840x2160`.
//!
//! # What this does instead
//!
//! [`poll_until`] spins in USER SPACE between attempts -- `core::hint::spin_loop()`, which is a
//! `pause` instruction and reaches no kernel and no wineserver -- and backs that budget off
//! exponentially, so a wait that does not resolve quickly settles into yielding a few thousand
//! times a second rather than a million. And it is BOUNDED: after [`MAX_YIELDS`] rounds it
//! returns `None` and the caller degrades, because a shell that cannot find its task manager
//! should be an inert shell, never a hung game.
//!
//! No sleep is involved, which `scripts/check-no-timeouts.py` would reject and which would be the
//! wrong instrument anyway: the thing being waited for is a state, and this polls that state.
