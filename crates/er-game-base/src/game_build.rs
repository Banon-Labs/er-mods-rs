//! Which ELDEN RING this DLL is loaded into, read from the running image's own version resource.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Every game address in this workspace is a 1.16.2 RVA. On 2026-08-27 the game shipped 1.17,
//! which moved code, and a detour installed at a 1.16.2 RVA landed in the MIDDLE of a different
//! 1.17 function: `0x1407ada40` is a real prologue in 1.16.2 (`push rbp; push rsi; push rdi`) and
//! `xor r15d, r15d` in 1.17. The result was an access violation ~3.5s into boot with a fabricated
//! `image_base | 0x64` pointer in `rcx` -- a crash whose backtrace points into game code and gives
//! no hint that the real fault was an address from a previous patch.
//!
//! A hook installed on an unrecognised build cannot be made safe by trying harder at the call
//! site; the address itself is meaningless. So the useful thing to know, before any detour goes
//! in, is simply *which build is this* -- and the image says so itself.
//!
//! # What it does NOT do
//!
//! It does not gate `er-hook`'s `write_code_byte`, which takes an ABSOLUTE address its caller
//! discovered by scanning rather than a 1.16.2 RVA -- there is nothing to translate, so a gate here
//! could only refuse work that is already version-agnostic. Its motivating caller was
//! `er-ersc-sigshim`, patching a FOREIGN module on builds this one calls unsupported; that crate
//! was retired on 2026-09-03 when the mod dropped support for old Seamless builds. The reasoning
//! outlives it: a scanned absolute address is not this module's business either way.
//!
//! `patch_3byte_stub` / `apply_xor_ret_stub` were named here too until 2026-08-30 and should not
//! have been: they take a 1.16.2 `rva`, not a scanned address, so they have something to translate
//! and now go through [`resolve_game_address`] like everything else.

// Reading the running image's own PE headers is a Windows-only operation, and these externs are
// undefined at LINK time on the host -- which host-unit-tested crates hit through `describe_build`.

// ONE TRANSLATION LINE PER ADDRESS, NOT PER RESOLUTION.
//
// `ADDRESS TRANSLATED` states a fact about an ADDRESS -- this 1.16.2 constant was carried to 1.17
// and the pair was verified as the same function. That fact does not change between two calls, so
// emitting it per call says nothing new and costs a formatted file append every time.
//
// MEASURED on the 2026-08-30 session's `er-quickload-autoload-debug.log`: 1.955 GB from a single
// run, of which a 40 MB sample taken at five points across the file was **99.03%** this one
// message (145,006 of 146,434 lines). The largest single contributor is
// `GX_RESERVE_CMD_QUEUE_SLOT_RVA (cmd-queue producer attribution band)` at ~18,500 lines per 8 MB
// in the tail -- `resolve_call_site_band` re-resolving the same anchor from the per-frame
// command-queue producer path. Extrapolated over the file that is ~6.8 million lines, ~4.5 million
// of them that one address.
//
// The second cost is the one that actually blocked work: the log became unreadable. A scan of the
// last 8 MB for `ADDRESS REFUSED`, `HOOK REFUSED`, `catalog: N named`, `GRANTED:`, `EQUIP LEDGER`,
// `loading-bar:`, `backstop` and `icon_id=` returned ZERO hits on all eight, because the tail is
// effectively 100% this message. The acceptance evidence for several landed fixes was in there
// somewhere and could not be found.
//
// So the line is emitted the FIRST time each row translates, and suppressed after. REFUSALS are
// bounded separately and much more loosely -- see the refusal ledger below. They are a different
// kind of fact and must never be reduced to one line per address, because a refusal is attributed
// to its CALLER (`mem::game_rva` puts the asking `file:line` in the label) and two callers
// refusing the same address are two different dead features.

//
//   * 339,764 lines of `ADDRESS REFUSED (game_rva): 0x140000000` in one 25-hour session, from
//     `delay_delete_pending` resolving RVA 0 on the 4 Hz telemetry write purely to obtain the
//     module base. Root-caused and gated by `scripts/check-no-rva-zero.py`.
//   * 628 lines of `ADDRESS REFUSED (CS_MSB_POINT_CTOR_RVA): 0x140cf9300` in the 2026-08-30 21:16
//     session's `er-invasion-warp.log`. That one is NOT a bug: `docs/recon/rva-map-1162-to-1170
//     .verified.tsv` records the row as deliberately absent (its 1.17 pair is correct by 16 caller
//     votes but verifies DIVERGES 0.09 on an Arxan entry-jmp, and writing the row would drop the
//     constructor from the CALL map too). The address is genuinely unmapped on 1.17, the feature
//     is genuinely unavailable, and the map-point reader asked again on every map open.
//
// The second one is the point: fixing individual callers does not close this, because the NEXT
// unmapped address does it again. The bound belongs here, once.
//
// WHAT IS BOUNDED, AND WHAT IS NOT.
//
//   * The first [`REFUSALS_LOGGED_PER_ADDRESS`] refusals of an address are logged in full,
//     unconditionally. The cap is 12 rather than 1 precisely because of the caller attribution
//     above: several distinct callers refusing the same address all get their own line.
//   * Refusal `REFUSALS_LOGGED_PER_ADDRESS + 1` logs a WENT-QUIET marker, so a reader can tell
//     "it stopped happening" from "it stopped being written down".
//   * After that the address logs again at each power of ten -- 100, 1,000, 10,000, ... -- each
//     line stating the running count. Growth is therefore logarithmic in the number of refusals
//     while the true magnitude still reaches the log. This is the part that matters: a bound that
//     merely truncated would leave a reader of 13 lines unable to tell 13 refusals from 4.5
//     million, and the magnitude is what says how hot the dead path is.
//
// Every one of those lines keeps the `ADDRESS REFUSED (<label>): 0x<addr>` prefix, so
// `scripts/record-1170-refusals.py` -- which harvests the DISTINCT addresses a real run asked for
// and was refused -- sees exactly what it saw before. It de-duplicates into a set, so fewer
// repeats of an address it already has cannot change its output.

/// A call site is a RETURN ADDRESS: a byte in the middle of a function, captured off the live
/// stack by `RtlCaptureStackBackTrace` and compared -- as `frame - module_base` -- against a
/// 1.16.2 constant. Nine such comparisons existed in this workspace on 2026-08-30, and every one
/// of them failed in PERFECT SILENCE on 1.17: no hook is installed, no address is resolved, so
/// there is no `HOOK REFUSED` and no `ADDRESS REFUSED`. The comparison simply never matches and
/// the feature behind it never runs. Two user-visible features were dead this way -- the three
/// cloned rows on the System>Quit tab, and the title FadeIn suppression -- with nothing in any
/// log to say so.
///
/// # Why it takes a function and an offset rather than one address
///
/// The address map is keyed on `.pdata` function STARTS, because that is what a masked signature
/// can identify and what the linker records. A mid-function address is not a function start, so
/// it can never appear in the map -- `scripts/select-needed-1170-rows.py` cannot even see it.
///
/// What a call site DOES have is a stable identity: it is the return of the Nth `call` in a named
/// function, and the offset of that call within its function survives the move whenever the body
/// is unchanged. So the mappable half is the containing function, and the offset rides along.
/// `scripts/derive-callsite-1170.py` prints the evidence for a given site: the `.pdata` record
/// that contains it, the map's pair for that function, and the callee each image's `E8` reaches
/// at the same offset -- which must be the same function under the map.
///
/// # Why this is not a detour licence
///
/// It resolves through [`resolve_game_address`], which reads the CALL/READ table. A detour needs
/// `resolve_detour_address` and its separate, stricter table. That separation is the whole point:
/// putting a mid-function address in a verdict table would license it as a DETOUR target --
/// `DETOURABLE_ENTRY_EVIDENCE` accepts `NEITHER-ENTRY` -- and MinHook would then write five bytes
/// into the middle of a live function. The offset here is added in Rust, AFTER resolution, and
/// never enters a table at all.
