//! Which ELDEN RING this DLL is loaded into, read from the running image's own version resource.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Every game address in this workspace is a 1.16.2 RVA. On 2026-08-27 the game shipped 1.17,
//! which moved code, and a detour installed at a 1.16.2 RVA landed in the MIDDLE of a different
//! 1.17 function: `0x1407ada40` is a real prologue in 1.16.2 (`push rbp; push rsi; push rdi`) and
//! `xor r15d, r15d` in 1.17. The result was an access violation ~3.5s into boot with a fabricated
//! `image_base | 0x64` pointer in `rcx` -- a crash whose backtrace points into game code and gives
//! no hint that the real fault was an address from a previous patch.
//!
//! A hook installed on an unrecognised build cannot be made safe by trying harder at the call
//! site; the address itself is meaningless. So the useful thing to know, before any detour goes
//! in, is simply *which build is this* -- and the image says so itself.
//!
//! # What it does NOT do
//!
//! It does not gate raw byte writes. [`crate::mem`]'s readers and `er-hook`'s
//! `write_code_byte` / `patch_3byte_stub` are used by version-AGNOSTIC code that discovers its
//! own addresses by scanning (`er-ersc-sigshim` rebuilds Seamless Co-op's lost AOB landmarks on
//! exactly the builds this module calls unsupported). Refusing those would break the one thing
//! that currently works on 1.17.
