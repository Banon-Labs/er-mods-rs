//! Make a Rust panic in a mod DLL say where it came from.
//!
//! # The gap this closes
//!
//! A `panic!` inside a cdylib loaded into ELDEN RING is, by default, invisible. The message goes
//! to `stderr`, which under me3 + Proton is nobody's file; the unwind then crosses an
//! `extern "system"` boundary -- a render-loop callback, a detour handler -- and the process
//! aborts. What reaches an investigator is a `0xe06d7363` record with `cpp_throw_type=rust_panic`
//! and a stack scan, which names the MODULE and nothing else.
//!
//! MEASURED, 2026-08-29. `er_build_watermark.dll` panicked 229 ms after the first backbuffer draw
//! and took the boot with it. `er-crash-latest.txt` identified the module and the throw type; the
//! backtrace symbolised to `core::result::unwrap_failed` and then to `??`, because the frames
//! below it were a raw stack scan rather than an unwind. Three `.expect()` calls in the
//! statically-linked renderer could have produced exactly that, and nothing on disk could say
//! which -- for a panic that had already been carried as unexplained for weeks.
//!
//! # What this does instead
//!
//! [`report_panics_to`] installs a `std::panic` hook that writes the payload and the source
//! location into the calling module's own log before the unwind starts, then chains to whatever
//! hook was already installed. The message is the part that matters: `.expect("D3DCompile")` and
//! `.expect("D3D12SerializeRootSignature")` are one line apart in the same file and produce
//! identical stack scans, and only the payload tells them apart.
//!
//! It does NOT stop the process dying. A panic unwinding out of an `extern "system"` callback is
//! already an abort by the time any hook runs, and pretending otherwise would be worse than the
//! silence -- see [`report_panics_to`]'s own note.

/// panicked" into "this line panicked" -- and a named failure can be fixed, where an anonymous
/// one gets rediscovered.
