//! Tier A: fault-safe readers for `FD4FileCap`, `DLString<wchar_t>` and the DLIO virtual-root
//! table.
//!
//! These moved down here from `er-title-flow` on 2026-08-25 because a SECOND image now needs
//! them: `er-diag-harness` carries the msb-parse / DLC-root / loadlist-wait traces that used to
//! be compiled into the product DLL, and every one of those traces names a file cap or a virtual
//! root in its log line. Copying the walkers into the harness would have put two literal
//! declarations on one address, which `scripts/check-rva-alias-drift.py` refuses -- and rightly:
//! divergent copies of a struct walk are divergent CLAIMS about the layout.
//!
//! They belong at this tier by construction. Every function below is a bounded `safe_read_*`
//! walk: no writes, no native calls, no vtable dispatch, no locks, and no allocation beyond the
//! returned `String`. They run on the game thread during a stall, so a fault or an unbounded
//! walk would be worse than the stall they are measuring. `er-title-flow` re-exports the whole
//! module, so its own call sites and the product's `constants/gaitem_restore.rs` re-export chain
//! are unchanged.
