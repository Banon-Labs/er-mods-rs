//! Tier A: the one line that says WHICH BINARY wrote a log.
//!
//! # The failure this exists to end
//!
//! A tester's log arrives with a symptom in it and the first question is always the same:
//! which build is that? On 2026-08-24 an `er-invasion-warp` log had to be dated by
//! string-matching its own format literals against the repo's source, because its opening
//! line was `loaded module_base=0x…` and nothing else -- no commit, no build time, no file
//! name. The alternative on offer was asking a human to courier DLLs across so a machine
//! could hash them. Both are archaeology in place of a field the writer already had.
//!
//! # Three facts, three different failure modes, all needed
//!
//! | fact | source | goes stale when |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | git sha + dirty | `build.rs`, baked at compile time | a tracked file is edited but never staged |
//! | PE timestamp | the DLL's own header, read at runtime | never -- the linker rewrites it on every relink |
//! | module file name | the loader, read at runtime | never |
//!
//! The PE timestamp is the anchor: it is per-module and exact, so a run mixing DLLs built
//! days apart (the ordinary case -- `er-crash-modules.txt` from 2026-08-23 carried a
//! bugfixes DLL from the 21st beside a crash logger from the 5th) shows that divergence
//! instead of hiding it behind one workspace-wide sha. It is also the SAME field
//! `er-crash-logging-core` prints for every loaded module, so a feature log and a crash dump can
//! be joined on it without anyone hashing anything.
