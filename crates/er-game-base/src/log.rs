//! Tier A: fresh-per-process file logger + game-directory resolver.
//!
//! The three DLLs each hand-copied a `log_line` / `append_autoload_debug`
//! writer. This is the shared core, parameterized by target filename. Callers
//! keep their own named wrappers (e.g. the product's `append_autoload_debug`,
//! `append_continue_trace`) over these primitives so log paths / prefixes stay
//! owned by each caller.
//!
//! # A log describes exactly ONE process run
//!
//! Standing rule (2026-08-04): no product DLL, shell or harness in this repo may
//! append to a log ACROSS runs. Every log file is truncated by the first write of
//! the process that owns it; keeping an older run means copying the file aside
//! yourself, not letting it accumulate.
//!
//! The concrete failure that set the rule: `er-invasion-warp` opened its log
//! with a plain `append(true)` on a fixed name next to the game executable. Twelve
//! separate launches piled into one 565 KB file, so a count taken over it ("37
//! confirms") read as ONE run doing something 37 times when it was really twelve
//! runs -- and per-run state could only be recovered by hand-splitting on the
//! module-base banner. Worse, lines from builds that no longer exist sat
//! indistinguishably next to lines from the build under test.
//!
//! [`begin_fresh_run`] is the one-shot that enforces it, and
//! [`open_fresh_run_append`] is the only sanctioned way to open a log for append.
//! `scripts/check-fresh-run-logs.py` fails the build on any other `.append(...)`
//! opener, so the rule is executable rather than a comment.
