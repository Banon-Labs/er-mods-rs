//! Tier A: has this process got a real, sized, top-level window yet?
//!
//! # Why an overlay has to ask
//!
//! hudhook's D3D12 pipeline is built on the first `Present` it intercepts, and building it starts
//! with `GetClientRect(swap_chain.GetDesc().OutputWindow).unwrap()`. Install the Present hook
//! before ELDEN RING has its window and the first Present you intercept can carry an
//! `OutputWindow` that is not a live window -- `GetClientRect` fails with `0x80070578`
//! ERROR_INVALID_WINDOW_HANDLE, the unwrap panics, and the panic unwinds out of an
//! `extern "system"` callback, which is an abort.
//!
//! MEASURED, 2026-08-29, twice, in different modules and therefore not a property of either:
//! `er_build_watermark.dll` died that way 229 ms after the first backbuffer draw; with that shell
//! excluded, `er_net_effects.dll` -- the next module to win the overlay-host claim -- died the
//! same way at +2060 ms. A third run with the same binaries did NOT die and reached a mapped
//! 3072x1712 window, which is what makes it a RACE against window creation rather than a
//! systematic failure, and what makes waiting the fix.
//!
//! # What it does not claim
//!
//! A window existing is not the game being ready, and this deliberately says nothing about the
//! swapchain, the device, or whether anything has been drawn. It answers exactly one question --
//! is there a visible top-level window belonging to this process with a non-empty client area --
//! because that is the precondition the `GetClientRect` above actually needs.
