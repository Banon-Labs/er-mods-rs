//! Run-length suppression for log lines that repeat verbatim.
//!
//! # The shape of the problem this solves
//!
//! Some diagnostics sit on a POLLED path: the game asks the same question every frame and
//! the hook answers it identically every frame. Measured on run `br-20260831-160354-2513`
//! (8m39s), `combined_load_67b940` was entered 8,639 times with `slot=-1 arg1=0 arg2=1`
//! every single time, from ONE caller stack, and the 8,639 `ENTER` lines had exactly
//! **seven** distinct contents between them. The trace cost 5.43 MB (37 MB/h) to carry
//! seven facts.
//!
//! # What is memoised, and what is NOT
//!
//! The suppression predicate is **full-message byte equality against the previous message
//! under the same key** -- the VALUE, not a label. This is the same governing rule as the
//! address-translation memo (bd
//! `memoise-on-the-value-not-the-label-one-label-covered-9-addresses-2026-08-30`), where
//! keying on the human-readable label would have suppressed 8 of 9 genuinely different
//! addresses that shared one label. Here the key selects only WHICH SLOT remembers the last
//! message; it is never itself the thing compared.
//!
//! That distinction is what makes a key collision harmless. Two families that hash to one
//! slot interleave, their messages differ, nothing matches, and both are emitted -- the
//! filter FAILS OPEN into today's behaviour. The only case where a collision suppresses
//! anything is two call sites emitting byte-identical text back to back, and byte-identical
//! text carries no distinct fact. There is no input for which this filter drops information
//! that the surviving lines plus their counts do not carry.
//!
//! # Counts are mandatory, not decoration
//!
//! A reader must never mistake "3 lines" for "3 calls". Every suppressed run is accounted
//! for twice over: a restatement on a 1-3-10 schedule while the run is still going (so
//! magnitude reaches the log even if the process dies mid-run, under-reporting by at most
//! 3x), and an exact total the moment the run ends.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! Formatting the message and taking one mutex per line. That is deliberately NOT the shape
//! chosen for the address path, which was 145,006 events and got a lock-free bitset; this
//! one replaces an `open()`+`write()`+`close()` per line, so a mutex is orders of magnitude
//! cheaper than what it removes. It is not for per-frame paths that currently do no I/O.
