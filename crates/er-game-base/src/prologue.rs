//! Tier A: compare a live function prologue against a generated pin, ignoring the operand bytes
//! that a game patch is GUARANTEED to re-encode.
//!
//! # The failure this exists to stop
//!
//! Every detour in this workspace byte-checks its target's prologue before installing, and
//! disarms with a log line when the bytes differ. That is the right default -- calling unknown
//! code costs the process. But three of those pins open with `mov rax, [rip+disp32]`, and a
//! rip-relative displacement is the delta from the end of the instruction to the global it names.
//! Both ends move when the game is patched. Measured on ELDEN RING 1.17: `FUN_140678740`,
//! `FUN_140678710` and `FUN_14067a980` are the same three instructions doing the same job at
//! correctly translated addresses, and all three gates disarmed -- on four bytes that could not
//! have survived. The features were silently off, and the log line blamed the game build.
//!
//! So the pin has to test instruction SHAPE at those four bytes and exact identity everywhere
//! else. The mask that says which is which is derived at build time from the same named
//! `iced-x86` instructions the pin itself is assembled from (`build-support/prologue_build.rs`),
//! so it cannot drift away from the bytes it describes and nobody hand-marks an offset.
//!
//! # What this deliberately does NOT do
//!
//! It does not make a pin lenient. A masked byte is only ever a RIP-relative displacement; the
//! opcode, the ModRM byte, register-base displacements (the struct field offsets that are the
//! ONLY difference between the `+0xb72` and `+0xb73` retractions), immediates and relative branch
//! targets are all still compared exactly. A target that is a different instruction still fails.
