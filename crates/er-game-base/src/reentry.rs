//! One thread-local re-entrancy latch, for the code paths that can be called from inside
//! themselves.
//!
//! # Why this keeps being needed
//!
//! Three separate places in this workspace have now been killed by the same shape, and each one
//! grew its own copy of the same latch before this module existed:
//!
//! | where | the loop |
//! |---|---|
//! | `save_policy_logs::append_autoload_debug` | the logger's own file open re-enters the `CreateFileW` detour, which logs |
//! | `er_save_redirect::reentry` | a detour's own `fs::read` re-enters the detour |
//! | `crashlog::veh_exit_hooks::crash_vectored_handler` | describing a fault faults, and a VEH is re-entered for its own faults |
//!
//! All three are SAME-THREAD synchronous recursion, so the latch is thread-local: a process-wide
//! flag would wrongly mute a legitimate concurrent call on another thread, which in the logger's
//! case silently drops most of the log.
//!
//! None of them are bounded by a call budget. A budget is checked once per entry and each entry
//! costs a whole stack frame, so the stack always runs out first -- measured on the VEH at 4704
//! bytes a level against a 1 MiB stack, dead after ~220 of a permitted 256.
//!
//! # The "unanswerable means nested" rule
//!
//! [`ReentryLatch::enter`] returns `None` when the thread-local cannot be reached at all -- during
//! thread teardown, or a fault early enough that TLS is not up. That counts as nested on purpose:
//! refusing one diagnostic costs a line, and guessing the other way costs the process.
