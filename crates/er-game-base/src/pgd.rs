// CS::PlayerGameData LAYOUT PINS (2026-08-30)
//
// WHY THESE EXIST. 44 sites across this workspace compute a PlayerGameData offset with
// `offset_of!`, and every one of them gets its answer from `../fromsoftware-rs`'s `#[repr(C)]`
// mirror. That mirror is provably a 1.16.2 MODEL: its filler fields are named `unka54`, `unka78`,
// `unka91`, `unkab4` -- which are exactly the 1.16.2 offsets measured as MOVED on 1.17
// (0xa54->0xa58, 0xa78->0xa80, 0xa91->0xa99, 0xab4->0xabc) -- and it ends at 0xae8, eight bytes
// short of the 1.17 object.
//
// Nothing is wrong today: every field this workspace actually references sits at or below
// face_data 0x760, and the first measured 1.17 move is at 0x960. The hazard is the SHAPE of the
// mechanism. A
// compiler-computed, `offset_of!`-bound constant looks maximally trustworthy -- it is the thing
// this repo reaches for INSTEAD of a hand-decoded hex number -- and it is one added field
// reference away from silently reading a neighbouring field. A wrong struct offset is the only
// 1.17 failure class with no refusal, no fault and no log line: it returns a plausible number of
// the right width, forever.
//
// So each referenced field's offset is frozen to a literal that was VERIFIED AGAINST THE TWO
// DE-ARXAN'D IMAGES, not copied out of the binding. The moment the sibling binding drifts -- an
// inserted field, a resized enum, a corrected `unk` filler -- these stop compiling and a human
// looks, instead of the DLL reading `base_max_hp` and calling it `current_max_hp`.
//
// HOW EACH LITERAL WAS VERIFIED. Every offset below is READ AS A PlayerGameData FIELD BY BOTH
// IMAGES, established by three routes that each prove the base register holds a PGD without any
// cross-image function pairing (the sets are built per image and then intersected):
//
//   A. the singleton chain -- `mov r64,[rip+GameDataMan]; mov r64,[r64+0x8]` and then
//      `[reg+0xNN]`. `GameDataMan+0x8` is `main_player_game_data`, the route 20+ live sites in
//      this workspace already take. Reproduce with:
//        scripts/check-singleton-field-offsets.py --pgd-offsets
//   B. functions CALLED with that chain's PGD pointer in an argument register, one level deep.
//   C. `CS::PlayerGameData`'s constructor (1.16.2 0x14025d580 -> 1.17 0x14025d550, paired by
//      scripts/map-rvas-1162-to-1170.py) and the methods of the vtable that constructor stores at
//      `[this+0]` (1.16.2 0x1429e15f8 / 0x1429e5fa8, 1.17 0x1429e45f8 / 0x1429e8fa8).
//
// Together those witness 109 PGD field offsets in BOTH images, and ALL 25 VALUES PINNED BELOW ARE
// AMONG THEM. That is the whole claim each pin rests on: 1.17 code demonstrably reads this offset
// as a PlayerGameData field, so the number is not merely "what the binding says".
//
// The two images' witness sets also differ at 20 offsets, and those are NOT all moves. A witness
// set is "offsets somebody's code happens to read inside the scanned window", not the object's
// field list, so a ONE-SIDED witness proves nothing by itself. Below 0xa58 the divergences at
// 0x18, 0x28, 0x38, 0x60 and 0x66 are one-sided coverage gaps.
//
// CORRECTED 2026-08-31 by aligning the CONSTRUCTOR'S two bodies rather than intersecting two
// witness sets (scripts/check-object-field-offsets-1170.py, whose 18 frozen rows re-measure this
// on every run; scripts/pair-object-field-drift.py is the matcher). The earlier reading of "+4
// from 0x9c8" and "0x964 read by 1.17 alone" was a coverage artifact of the census: 0x9c8 was
// merely the LOWEST moved offset that scan happened to witness, and 0x964 is not a new 1.17
// field at all. The real shape is one 4-byte insertion at 0x960:
//
//   1.16.2 ctor: mov [rbx+0x958],..  lea rcx,[rbx+0x960]  call <stat sub-object ctor>
//   1.17   ctor: mov [rbx+0x958],..  mov byte [rbx+0x960],0  lea rcx,[rbx+0x964]  call <same>
//
// 254 of 254 instructions align; the only structural difference is that inserted store. The
// 0x118-byte stat sub-object is otherwise byte-identical (its own ctor aligns with zero moved
// offsets), so it now ends at 0xa7c instead of 0xa78, and the 8-byte-aligned pointer that
// follows lands at 0xa80. Hence TWO bands, not one:
//
//   [0x000, 0x960)  HELD   -- everything this workspace references, up to face_data 0x760
//   [0x960, 0xa78)  +4     -- e.g. resistance_gauges 0x9c8 -> 0x9cc (leaf accessor, independent)
//   [0xa78, 0xae8)  +8     -- e.g. the scadutree override 0xab4 -> 0xabc
//
// A mechanical "+8 above the insertion" fix would therefore put resistance_gauges at 0x9d0 --
// four bytes into the array rather than at its start, reading a neighbouring element with no
// fault and no log line. That is the whole reason the bands are written out here.
//
// EIGHT REFERENCED FIELDS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT PINNED, because the 1.17 image never witnesses
// their offset and a pin asserting a value nobody verified is worse than no pin. They are, with
// the offset the binding computes and what the images actually say about it:
//
//   base_max_hp                    0x18   read by 1.16.2 twice, by 1.17 never in this scan;
//                                         bracketed by BOTH-witnessed 0x14 and 0x1c
//   base_max_fp                    0x24   no witness in EITHER image; bracketed by 0x20 and 0x2c
//   base_max_stamina               0x34   no witness in either; bracketed by 0x30 and 0x3c
//   intelligence                   0x50   no witness in either; bracketed by 0x4c and 0x68
//   faith                          0x54   no witness in either; bracketed by 0x4c and 0x68
//   arcane                         0x58   no witness in either; bracketed by 0x4c and 0x68
//   base_hero_point                0x5c   no witness in either; bracketed by 0x4c and 0x68
//   matchmaking_spirit_ashes_level 0xc7   no witness in either; bracketed by 0xc6 and 0xc8
//
// A bracket is NOT a proof. A compensating insertion-plus-removal inside one bracket moves the
// fields between its ends while leaving both ends exactly where they were -- which is precisely
// what the audit measured happening to `CS::PlayerIns`: an 8-byte insertion in (0x398,0x3a8] and
// an 8-byte removal in (0x560,0x580] (narrowed 2026-08-31 from the earlier (0x38c,0x400] /
// (0x538,0x580] by aligning the constructor, the destructor and 183 vtable slots), net object
// size unchanged, so a "+8 above the insertion" rule would have corrupted
// PLAYER_INS_SESSION_MANAGER_PLAYER_ENTRY_OFFSET = 0x6b8, which is witnessed HELD by both the
// constructor and `~PlayerIns`. Seven of these eight sit in brackets one or two slots wide
// where that is implausible, but implausible is not measured, so they stay unpinned and named
// here rather than argued into place.
