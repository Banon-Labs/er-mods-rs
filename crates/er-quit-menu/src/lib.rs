//! Standalone ME3 shell for all four cloned System>Quit rows -- **Load Character**, **Load
//! Character from File**, **Load Build from URL** and **Generate Build Link** -- with no product
//! DLL in the profile.
//!
//! Everything the rows are made of lives in `er-quit-menu-core`, which the product DLL also links
//! and arms. The two loads now pass the same `RowSet::ALL`; what still differs is the flow table.
//! The product supplies its save-safe character switch, its Save Game flow and its picker; this
//! shell supplies the two openers the feature crate already owns and leaves the rest at `None`,
//! which the router reads as a press it must not carry out.
//!
//! # Why one shell arms all four rather than two shells arming halves
//!
//! Halves were tried on 2026-09-12 and measured the same day. Each cdylib links its own copy of
//! `er-quit-menu-core`, so `ROW_SET`, the row table and the arm latch are per DLL; both
//! `AddCancelButton` detours sat on the hook union and both fired, and each shell cloned its pair
//! into the same dialog and then again on the other's pass. The result was a six-cell grid holding
//! `item_count=10`, two row tables disagreeing about which index is Return to Desktop, and every
//! press resolving `row=AMBIGUOUS` -- so the safety gate suppressed Save Game and refused the
//! instant quit, and what the player saw was the native Return-to-Desktop confirm behind every row.
//! One arm in one process is the only shape that works without shared cross-DLL state.
//!
//! # What this shell has to install that the product already had
//!
//! Three things, and each fails differently, so each is reported separately:
//!
//! * the derived six-cell `02_040_optionsetting` grid the rows are cells of, and the `02_990`
//!   movie the link field opens, both served from the Scaleform file-open prologue;
//! * a `MenuWindowJob::Run` detour, which is the only context in which the link field's job can be
//!   submitted and its display objects resolved;
//! * a `FrameBegin` task, which is the only context in which an import may touch the inventory.
//!
//! # Never in the same profile as `er-quit-load-character`, and never beside a `quit-rows` product
//!
//! Any other host that arms rows is a second cloner, for the reason above, and both derive the same
//! movie -- `er_gfx::options_02_040::quit6` fail-closes when its input is not vanilla, so a second
//! deriver handed already-derived bytes correctly refuses. `scripts/me3-dll-conflicts.toml` records
//! those pairs and the profile generator refuses to emit a profile carrying both. A default
//! `er-quickload` is not one of them: it arms no rows and derives no grid since `quit-rows` came
//! off its default features.
//!
//! # What stays refused here
//!
//! Every product-owned answer in the host seam stays at its neutral default -- including the
//! save-write bypass, so a product-less load can never push a write past `er-save-suppress`.

// A cdylib whose every consumer is `DllMain` and the hooks it installs, all of them
// `#[cfg(windows)]`. On a host build the shell is compiled with its only callers cfg'd
// out, so `dead_code`/`unused_imports` there report the cfg, not real debt. The shipping
// target (x86_64-pc-windows-msvc) carries the full deny with no allows.
