// POSITIVE row identity for the five-row System -> Quit dialog.
//
// # Why the previous identity was wrong
//
// The Quit-tab routing keyed every decision on an "action object" pointer read from
// `controller + PROPERTY_NEW_BUTTON_CONTROLLER_ACTION_OBJECT_OFFSET` (`+0xa8`). That pointer is
// **not an object of its own** -- it is a fixed-offset ALIAS of the controller:
//
// `CS::PropertyNewButtonController` is a 0x300-byte heap object (`HeapAlloc(0x300, 8, ...)` in the
// 1.16.2 dump's `FUN_14086a950`) whose constructor `FUN_14086a2a0` copy-constructs the caller's
// action `std::function` into `this + 0x70` (`param_1 + 0xe`) and stores the resulting
// `_Getter()` pointer at `this + 0xa8` (`param_1[0x15]`). MSVC's `std::function` keeps that getter
// slot at `storage + 0x38` and, for a small (inline) callable, it points at the storage itself --
// so `*(controller + 0xa8) == controller + 0x70`, always. Every logged row in the measured run
// agrees on all four rows: `0x23517880+0x70 = 0x235178f0`, `0x23517580+0x70 = 0x235175f0`,
// `0x23518180+0x70 = 0x235181f0`, `0x23517b80+0x70 = 0x23517bf0`.
//
// Therefore `action_obj == captured_action` is exactly `controller == captured_controller` wearing
// a disguise, and it carries no row information whatsoever. Worse, the visible buttons are
// dispatched through only TWO controllers: in the measured run only the two NATIVE row controllers
// ever reached `PropertyNewButtonController::Activate` (0x23517880 with index 0, 0x23517580 with
// index 1, twice per frame), and the two cloned rows' controllers never appeared at all. So a click
// on the fourth visible button ("Load Character from File") arrives carrying the second native row's
// controller -- and the old gate read that as "the user confirmed Return to Desktop" and called
// `ExitProcess(0)`.
//
// # The identity used instead
//
// Each `EditProperty` row carries its own LABEL, and the label is reachable live from the dialog:
// `PropertyEditDialog.properties.items` starts at `dialog + 0x1268`, rows are `0x88` apart, and
// `EditProperty.label` at `+0x8` is a `CS::MenuHelpLabelComponent` whose first field is the
// `MenuString`'s RAW UTF-16 pointer (`CS::MenuString::MenuString` stores the pointer it is given).
// The cloned rows are built from this DLL's own process-lifetime label arrays, so they match by
// exact POINTER equality; every row also matches by text. That is measured, not assumed: a run of
// the four-row build reported `oracle_optionsetting_active_row_count = 4` with
// `oracle_optionsetting_active_row_quit_label_mask = 15`, i.e. all four rows' labels were readable
// and each matched one of the four known Quit labels, on the very dialog (`0x175842080`) the fatal
// click came from. `cloned_mask = 12` and `native_save_mask = 1` pin the order: row 0 Save Game,
// row 1 Return to Desktop, row 2 Load Character, row 3 Load Character from File -- and the fifth
// row, Load Build from URL, is appended after them by the same cloner in the same pass.
//
// Which row was ACTIVATED comes from ONE source for all three input kinds: the dialog's own list
// cursor, `dialog + 0xb0c` -- field `+0xd4` of the `CS::GridControl` embedded at `dialog + 0xa38`
// (`FUN_140739e20` returns it; the widget's item count is `+0xd0 == dialog + 0xb08`).
//
// # Why the cursor is authoritative for the mouse too
//
// `GridControl::Update` (vtable `+0x10`, 1.16.2 `FUN_1407392f0`) is the single writer of that field:
//
//   * MOUSE -- `GridControl::HandleMouse` (`FUN_14073a5c0`) ends by asking, when the cursor is live
//     (`FUN_140758050`: `CSMenuManImp::disableMouseCursor == false`) and the mouse is the active
//     pointer (`FUN_1407588a0`: `CSMouseMan + 0x30`) and no drag/wheel/direction input is in flight,
//     `FUN_140736c90(this, FUN_140757af0(pad))`. That hit-tests each of the `cols * rows` grid CELL
//     proxies via `FUN_14074b0d0`, converts the hit cell's `(row, col)` into an item index, and calls
//     `FUN_14073bc10(this, index)` -- which writes `+0xd4`. Hover moves the native cursor.
//   * PAD / KEYBOARD -- the direction branches of the same `Update` (`FUN_14073b0c0` /
//     `FUN_14073b4d0` / `FUN_14073a250`) land on the same `FUN_14073bc10`, and `Update` then diffs
//     `+0xd4` against its pre-update value to fire the selection-changed callbacks.
//
// There is no separate focus field. So once the two rows this DLL adds are real grid cells, the
// cursor identifies the row for mouse, keyboard and pad alike -- see `er_gfx::options_02_040` for the
// movie-side half (the cells are named `Item_1_0`/`Item_1_1`/`Item_2_0` so the grid measures 2x3,
// which is what makes them hit-testable AND puts the vertical axis in play).
//
// The cursor's two halves are cross-checked and must agree: the captured build-time row TABLE
// (index -> row) and the LIVE label read at that index. A mismatch, an unreadable label, an
// out-of-range cursor or a stale dialog are all `Ambiguous`, and an ambiguous row NEVER quits and
// never runs anything.
