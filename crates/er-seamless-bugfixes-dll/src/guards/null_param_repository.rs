//! The load-balancer frame step, guarded against a torn-down `SoloParamRepository`.
//!
//! # The crash
//!
//! A tester's Elden Ring died the same way twice, a day apart (2026-08-22 18:27Z and
//! 2026-08-23 04:35Z), on a profile carrying only this DLL and the crash logger. The fatal record
//! is a NULL WRITE at `eldenring.exe+0x1eb9999` -- but that address is inside `DLPanic`'s body,
//! not inside the code with the bug. The access violation is the panic's death rattle.
//!
//! What actually happened is an assertion the game raises on itself:
//!
//! ```text
//! DLPanic("w:\\gr\\patch116\\...\\Core/Singleton/FD4Singleton.h", 0xb4,
//!         "%s:<uninitialised singleton accessed>", GetRuntimeClassName(0x143d5ae58))
//! ```
//!
//! Proven rather than inferred: the crash log's frame `#8` is `0x140d3d669`, which is exactly the
//! return address of the `CALL 0x141eb97a0` (`DLPanic`) at `0x140d3d664`, and the only path that
//! reaches that call is the `MOV RCX,[0x143d81ee8]; TEST RCX,RCX; JNZ` immediately above it. The
//! logged `stack_raw[0]` still held `eldenring.exe+0x3292b38` -- the message operand from the
//! `LEA R8` two instructions earlier.
//!
//! # Why it fires
//!
//! The full chain is `WinMain -> MainLoop -> CleanupUpdate -> FUN_140e0cca0 -> FUN_140d3cad0 ->`
//! this function. `FUN_140e0cca0` is the per-frame load-balancer refresh, and it is gated on
//! `GLOBAL_GXRenderingSystem->field_0x13a68 + 0x34`. So the rendering system is still alive and
//! still asking for `LoadBalancerParam` on a frame where the param repository has already been
//! destroyed: a teardown-ordering race inside the game, on the main thread, reachable by anyone.
//!
//! # Why the early return is the right answer
//!
//! This guard does not invent a value; it takes the branch the function already has. When
//! `GetParamResCap` returns null, or when the binary search misses, control falls to
//! `0x140d3d755`:
//!
//! ```text
//! 140d3d755: MOV dword ptr [RSI + 0x8], EBP    ; out->tag   = param_2
//! 140d3d758: MOV qword ptr [RSI], RBX          ; out->value = 0   (EBX was XORed at 0x140d3d634)
//! ```
//!
//! with `RSI` holding the out pointer (`rcx` on entry) and `EBP` holding `param_2` (`edx` on
//! entry, saved at `0x140d3d613`). The stub writes those two fields and returns, which is
//! byte-for-byte the "no row for this platform" outcome the caller is already written against --
//! the same rule the sibling guards follow.
//!
//! # Coverage
//!
//! This is a group of one. It does not pair with the `null_special_effect` guards and arming it
//! alone is a complete, safe state.
