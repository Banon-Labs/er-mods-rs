//! The build watermark as a mod of its own.
//!
//! # Why it is its own DLL
//!
//! The watermark answers "which builds are in this process, and is any of them behind `main`" --
//! a question about the whole profile, not about any one feature. Living inside a feature DLL
//! made it hostage to that feature: it appeared only in profiles that happened to load
//! `er-net-effects`, and a profile of one unrelated mod got no watermark at all. As its own
//! `[[natives]]` entry it is opt-in per profile, ships on its own, and has no opinion about what
//! else is loaded -- it reports whatever answers `er_build_identity_v1`, which every DLL in this
//! workspace exports whether or not it knows this shell exists.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! No detours, no game memory writes, no input. It installs one hudhook overlay, reads the
//! module list, and draws text. If another module in the process already owns the overlay, this
//! one stands down and draws nothing rather than installing a second imgui on the same swapchain.
