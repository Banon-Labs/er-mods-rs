//! Does the MERGED ProfileSelect row header actually fit before the attribute block?
//!
//! Merging `PlayerName` + the `Level` caption + the level value into one left-aligned string moves
//! where the row's ink stops: instead of a short name ending well before a fixed caption, one run
//! now grows rightward toward `ErCharStats`. That boundary is the only new geometric risk the merge
//! introduces, and it is measurable offline -- the menu font's own per-glyph advances are in the
//! extracted `font.gfx`, so this is arithmetic, not judgement.
//!
//! Corpus-gated: SKIPS (does not fail) when the extracted font is absent, like every other test that
//! needs real asset bytes. No game-derived bytes are versioned here.
