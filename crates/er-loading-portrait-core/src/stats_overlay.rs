// Loading-screen character-stats block on the native-Windows isolated overlay.
//
// Ports the EXISTING game-menu-font loading-screen stats (er-effects-rs-jsm) onto the separate-window
// overlay so native Windows shows the stats the USER expects: the game's OWN menu font (MenuFont_01 via
// `er_gfx::raster::RasterFont`, captured from the game's `font.gfx`), the same on-screen SIZE
// (`em_px = screen_max * 48/2056`), and the same LOCATION (top-left at 5% width / 60% height -- the exact
// mapping `stats_text_screen_position` used for the retired in-swapchain Present overlay (path A, deleted)).
//
// The difference vs the Wine path: the composite is PURELY CPU here (`render_lines_to_rgba` -> versioned
// screen bitmap -> `blend_rgba_over`), so it never creates resources or submits command lists on the game's
// D3D12 device -- that shared-device work is exactly what crashes the strict native AMD driver, which is why
// the overlay is a separate isolated device in the first place. The stat LINES are built on the game thread
// by `maybe_build_stats_text` (safe guarded game-memory reads, driven from lifecycle.rs on native); this
// render-thread path only re-rasters those cached lines at screen scale and alpha-blends the bitmap.
//
// Included into gpu_readback.rs (same namespace as boot_progress.rs / save_picker_overlay.rs), so it calls
// the in-namespace `save_picker_overlay_active()` directly and the flat `crate::` re-exports
// (`stats_text_available`, `stats_text_screen_bitmap`, `blend_rgba_over`) for the startup_hooks helpers.

/// Cumulative count of overlay frames where the stats block ACTUALLY blended onto the backbuffer
/// (telemetry `oracle_overlay_stats_draw_hits`). RAM semaphore that the game-font stats composite reached

/// behavioral-feature-proof rule: this proves the composite RAN, not that the pixels look right; visual
/// acceptability is the user's call from the captured frame.
