//! Undo the two mutilations the native profile feed performs on the ChrAsm it is handed.
//!
//! `FUN_140bbe1a0` -- what `PROFILE_RENDERER_SET_MODEL_SOURCE_RVA` names and what the loading
//! portrait's per-slot build kick calls -- is not a plain "install this character's equipment".
//! Decompiled from the 1.16.2 named dump (and byte-identical on 1.17: `docs/recon/

//! score 1.000 over 119 instructions), it does exactly three things:
//!
//! ```text
//!   FUN_140bb9850(renderer, source)   -> ChrAsm::Copy(renderer+0x548, source)   // our record
//!   EquipItemBySpecialIndex(chrAsm, ~RightWeaponSlot,  {0})                     // ... x8, all
//!   EquipItemBySpecialIndex(chrAsm, ~LeftWeaponSlot,   {0})                     // with a ZERO
//!   EquipItemBySpecialIndex(chrAsm, ~RightBoltSlot,    {0})                     // InventoryItem
//!   EquipItemBySpecialIndex(chrAsm, ~LeftBoltSlot,     {0})                     // entry, i.e.
//!   EquipItemBySpecialIndex(chrAsm, 6..9,              {0})                     // a CLEAR
//!   EquipProtectorOrAccessory(chrAsm, 2, handle(GetDefaultProtectorParamId(2)))  // hands
//!   EquipProtectorOrAccessory(chrAsm, 3, handle(GetDefaultProtectorParamId(3)))  // legs
//! ```
//!
//! `EquipItemBySpecialIndex` (0x1403bf660) is `EquipItem(chrAsm, GetBySpecialIndex(chrAsm, i), &h)`
//! and `EquipItem` stores `-1` into `equipment_param_ids[slot]` when the handle resolves to nothing,
//! so those eight calls with a zeroed entry are erasures. `EquipProtectorOrAccessory` (0x1403bf490)
//! is `EquipItem(chrAsm, slot + ProtectorHead, h)`, so the last two overwrite the character's own
//! gauntlets and greaves with the bare-body rows 10200/10300.
//!
//! That is the whole bug, both halves of it. The portrait shows no arm or leg armour because the
//! feed replaced them, and it shows no weapon -- and therefore no handedness -- because the feed
//! erased them. Neither is a limitation of the render path: the per-frame model-resource request
//! `FUN_1409e6fb0` resolves armaments as thoroughly as armour (`EquipParamWeapon::GetEntry`,
//! `weaponCategory` tests) and reads handedness straight out of the ChrAsm
//! (`getSelectedWeaponSlotIndex(&param_2->equipment.armStyle, 0|1)` -> `selectedWeaponSlotIndex`).
//! Hand it a ChrAsm that still has its weapons and it draws them.
//!
//! So the repair is to write the record's own `equipment_param_ids` back over the fed array after
//! the feed returns and before the build is kicked. PARAM IDS only, never the gaitem handles: the
//! render path resolves equipment from the id array alone (`GetProtectorParamIdBySlot` is
//! `mov 0x7c(%rcx,%rdx,4),%eax`), while the handle array is refcounted state this process owns --
//! the feed put two real default-protector handles in it, and stealing or overwriting those is how
//! PR #128 broke refcounts without fixing the picture.
//!
//! This module is the deterministic half: which indices differ, and what to report about them. The
//! unsafe read/write of live renderer memory stays with the caller.
