// === Loading-screen portrait bug SEMAPHORES (2026-07-04) ==========================================
// Two user-reported bugs on the loading transition, resolved to RAM/pixel oracles derived from the
// captured `LOADING_BG_PORTRAIT_RGBA` (the content that feeds the loading-screen portrait display):
//   Bug A -- historically, the portrait rendered too small unintentionally (correct content, ~256px
//            square). Root suspect: the `find_d3d12_resource_ex` "largest TEXTURE2D" scan picked a
//            small RT instead of the intended target RT (deterministic-pointer fix pending). Current
//            low-res experiments may intentionally trip the same size semaphore.
//   Bug B -- our neutral stats-panel texture (RGB 30,28,26) leaked onto the loading screen. Root
//            suspect: the same scan grabbed one of our 256x256 neutral CreateTpfResCap textures.
// These oracles let a monitor detect each condition live without reading the screenshot: they carry the
// captured dims, the neutral-color fraction, and once-seen latches stamped with the capture version.
/// Threshold (px): a captured portrait whose larger side is <= this is "too small" for monitoring.
/// The high-quality loading portrait target should be 1024x1024 after native supersampling, so anything
/// at or below the old 256/512 class remains a regression tripwire.

///
/// The render is what clips a long weapon, and no compositing change can bring back pixels the

/// in turn: centre it and the straight cut edge sits in plain view, or anchor the cut side to the
/// matching display edge (`portrait_dst_left`) and the character is thrown off centre -- measured
/// 2026-09-08 on `TTV/RustBucket`, whose halberd reached the render's left column and pushed the
/// whole composite flush left with the right 45% of the screen left black.
///
/// Matching the aspect removes the choice. The render covers the same shape as the display, the
/// composite fills it edge to edge, and any silhouette that still runs off the side runs off the
/// screen's own edge -- which reads as a character continuing past the frame rather than as a cut.
///
/// # Why the width dword is the one that moves
///
/// Measured, not assumed. `CS::CSMenuProfModelRend::CSMenuProfModelRend` (1.16.2 dump,
/// `0x140bbdf20`) sets the camera aspect at `+0xa24` to
/// `(float)*(int *)(&DAT_143b39848 + row) / (float)*(int *)(&DAT_143b3984c + row)` -- numerator at
/// `row+0x00`, denominator at `row+0x04` -- so the low dword is width, the high dword is height,
/// and the engine derives the render aspect from the pair rather than stretching a square.
///
/// # The 2026-09-07 revert, and why it does not stand
///
/// A 2056x1542 widening was built and backed out the same day because run
/// `br-20260907-201055-59a5` died at the title with `0xe06d7363`. That crash was read again on
/// 2026-09-08 and it is not this: caller `#7=0x1800258b0` is the return address of
/// `mov ecx,5 ; call 0x1800f8e38` at `ersc+0x258ab`, inside Seamless's invade action, throwing
/// `std::system_error` errno 36 on a session mutex it could not take. Same bug as the cancel-side
/// crash that day, one action over, and unrelated to the render target. See bd
/// `nonsquare-portrait-rt-revert-blamed-the-ersc-invade-deadlock-2026-09-08`.
///
/// # The resize case
///
/// The display is read once, when the row is patched, which is before the renderers are
/// constructed. A player who moves the game to a different monitor or resizes it mid-load keeps the
/// aspect this returned, and the composite covers rather than letterboxes, so the result is a crop
/// rather than a black band. Accepted as an edge case by the user, 2026-09-08.
