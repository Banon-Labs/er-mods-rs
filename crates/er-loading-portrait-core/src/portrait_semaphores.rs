// === Loading-screen portrait bug SEMAPHORES (2026-07-04) ==========================================
// Two user-reported bugs on the loading transition, resolved to RAM/pixel oracles derived from the
// captured `LOADING_BG_PORTRAIT_RGBA` (the content that feeds the loading-screen portrait display):
//   Bug A -- historically, the portrait rendered TOO SMALL unintentionally (correct content, ~256px
//            square). Root suspect: the `find_d3d12_resource_ex` "largest TEXTURE2D" scan picked a
//            small RT instead of the intended target RT (deterministic-pointer fix pending). Current
//            low-res experiments may intentionally trip the same size semaphore.
//   Bug B -- our NEUTRAL stats-panel texture (RGB 30,28,26) leaked onto the loading screen. Root
//            suspect: the same scan grabbed one of our 256x256 neutral CreateTpfResCap textures.
// These oracles let a monitor detect each condition live without reading the screenshot: they carry the
// captured dims, the neutral-color fraction, and once-seen latches stamped with the capture version.
/// Threshold (px): a captured portrait whose larger side is <= this is "too small" for monitoring.
/// The high-quality loading portrait target should be 1024x1024 after native supersampling, so anything
/// at or below the old 256/512 class remains a regression tripwire.
