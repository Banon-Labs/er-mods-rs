// PER-LOAD-WINDOW PORTRAIT VERDICT SEMAPHORES (user directive 2026-07-31: "get the semaphores to
// show us that our render portrait isn't working on every load").
//
// Telemetry-only: this file reads existing counters and native-hook timestamps; it changes NO
// product behavior. For EVERY native loading-screen window in a session (boot, profile switches,
// deaths, fast travel -- anything that ticks `CS::LoadingScreen::Update`), it latches one verdict
// record: did the custom rendered portrait actually DISPLAY during that window, at what size, and
// if not, which pipeline stage was empty. The per-window verdict is exposed three ways:
//   1. a `PORTRAIT-LOADWIN VERDICT #n` debug-log line at window close (human-readable per load),
//   2. scalar aggregate oracles (`oracle_portrait_loadwin_total/ok_full/...`),
//   3. `oracle_portrait_loadwin_history` -- a JSON array of the last N window records, so one
//      telemetry snapshot names every load of the session and its failure class.
//
// Window boundaries: OPEN when `LOADING_SCREEN_UPDATE_LAST_MS` turns fresh (the native
// LoadingScreen update hook stamps it every frame the screen is live); CLOSED after it has been
// quiet for `LOADWIN_QUIET_CLOSE_MS`. Sampled from the telemetry writer (~4 Hz), which bounds
// boundary error to ~250 ms on windows that last seconds -- fine for verdict purposes.
//
// Verdict classes (`cause`):
//   ok-full                 displayed, published side >= LOADWIN_FULL_MIN_SIDE (the product bar)
//   displayed-small         displayed, published side <= the small threshold (the PIXELATED defect)
//   displayed-mid           displayed, published side in between
//   displayed-stale         overlay drew frames but NOTHING published this window: the shown head
//                           is a prior window's held frame (the WRONG/STALE-portrait defect)
//   published-not-displayed publishes happened but the overlay never drew them
//   captures-rejected       captures arrived but every publish was rejected (neutral/small gate)
//   kicked-no-publish       a renderer build was kicked but no capture ever published
//   no-kick                 the pipeline never even targeted this window
// A `+short` suffix marks windows shorter than the ~confirm->publish latency, where a missing
// portrait is expected-by-latency rather than a pipeline failure.

/// PUBLISHED-vs-LOADED identity check for one closed window (bd er-effects-rs-qoqc defect 6 /

/// THE DANGLING WINDOW (2026-08-22). `loading_portrait_window_reset` had ZERO callers in the whole
/// workspace; the only live reset was its switch variant, reached solely from
/// `rearm_boot_progress_for_own_menu_load` -- a System->Quit slot confirm. So a NORMAL load never
/// released the published head, the frozen crop envelope, `LOADING_BG_PORTRAIT_SPARED_RENDERER` (a
/// live `CSMenuProfModelRend` retained forever and never delete-enqueued),
/// `PORTRAIT_ANIM_BOUND_RENDERER`, `PROFILE_RT_PIN`/`PROFILE_DEPTH_PIN`, or
/// `PORTRAIT_WINDOW_TARGET_SLOT`.
///
/// WHAT IT BUYS, honestly: a future spurious cover has no portrait left to put on screen, and the
/// per-session renderer leak stops. It does NOT stop the cover surface itself reappearing -- our
/// compositor is not what draws that (`cover_after_release.rs` is the instrumentation that will
/// say what does).
///
/// WHY IT IS DEFERRED RATHER THAN DONE AT THE CLOSE. The window closes `LOADWIN_QUIET_CLOSE_MS`
/// after the native loading screen stops ticking, and OUR cover outlives that by its release fade.
/// In run br-20260822-184123-fa3d the native screen last ticked at 35504 ms, so the window closes
/// at 37004 ms, while the cover's release fade did not complete until 37714 ms -- and
/// `portrait_onto_draw_hits` advanced by 10 across exactly that stretch. Releasing at the close
/// would therefore have blanked the portrait for the last ~710 ms of a fade that was still on
/// screen. So the close only ARMS the release; this runs it on a later ~4 Hz tick, once
/// `BOOT_VIEW_STOPPED` says the cover has genuinely let go.
///
/// MAKE-BEFORE-BREAK is preserved by two guards:
///   * a System->Quit switch in flight (`BOOT_VIEW_OWN_MENU_LOAD_ACTIVE`) is skipped outright. That
///     latch is set at the switch rearm and cleared only when the switch's cover stops, so it spans
///     the return-to-title teardown window -- whose close would otherwise wipe state the
///     character-load window that follows is about to need. The pending flag is dropped when that
///     next window opens and re-armed at its close, so nothing is lost by waiting.
///   * inside the reset itself, an outstanding provisional same-identity hold keeps the bridge and
///     the frozen crop envelope, exactly as the switch variant does -- so the head a confirm-press
///     chose to keep survives this path too.
///
/// ORDER vs THE VERDICT. The reset clears counters `PORTRAIT-LOADWIN VERDICT` reads --
/// `LS_PORTRAIT_PUBLISHED_SLOT` (its `slot_tag` and its whole `identity=` check),
/// `PORTRAIT_TARGET_NAME_HASH`, and `PORTRAIT_KICK_SLOT_KEY` (`kicked=`). Deferring past the close
/// puts it strictly after the verdict line and the history record, so those numbers still describe
/// the window they name.
