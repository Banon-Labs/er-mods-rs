/// First, cost: answering "is this buffer masked" needs a walk of the alpha channel. `portrait_onto`
/// ALREADY walks it -- it has to, to find the head's bounding box -- so the gate rides that existing
/// pass for free, whereas this function is polled at least twice per frame (`boot_view_render_frame`
/// and the Present path both call it to decide `full_frame`) and is documented as a lock plus a
/// presence check. Putting the walk here would add two full alpha scans per frame to buy nothing.
///
/// Second, and the reason it would be wrong even if it were free: this predicate decides the overlay's
/// GEOMETRY, not its content. A true answer forces the full-screen canvas instead of the tight progress
/// strip. If it flipped with the mask, the overlay would start as a strip, then jump to full-screen the
/// instant the first keyed frame landed -- a visible layout snap in the middle of the loading screen,
/// caused by the fix rather than by the defect. Reporting "a portrait is published, lay out for it" and
/// then declining to draw an unmasked one keeps the canvas stable and simply leaves the head absent
/// until it is ready, which is exactly the requested behaviour.
///
/// Both display hosts reach the refusal because both go through `portrait_onto`: the product boot view
/// (`boot_progress.rs` -> `boot_view_rasterize`, which also feeds the native isolated overlay and the

    //   1. The frame itself. An unmasked buffer is alpha-255 everywhere, so the alpha-over blit below
    //      copies the character's entire SCENE BACKGROUND onto the loading screen. That is the visible
    //      defect: the first composited portrait frame showed the render including its backdrop.
    //   2. The crop envelope, which outlives the frame. The `PORTRAIT_CROP_*` union is seeded from the
    //      first PORTRAIT_CROP_SEED_N frames and then FROZEN forever. An unmasked frame's bounding box
    //      is the WHOLE square, so folding even one in pins the envelope at maximum and every later
    //      masked head is scaled down inside that oversized rect for the rest of the loading screen.
    //      A live run measured `oracle_portrait_alpha_cover_pct = 99` against a
    //      `oracle_depth_key_bg_pct` of 76 -- those cannot both describe a keyed frame. Returning
    //      before the fold is what makes a refused frame cost nothing beyond the frame it was in.

    // The predicate is the bridge's, so it is the same floor the capture side publishes against; see
    // `portrait_mask_share_ok` for why it is a binary "was anything cut at all" and never a quality
    // score, and why it is judged per-BUFFER rather than from the per-window PROFILE_HAVE_KEYED_FRAME
    // flag (which re-arms wrong on switch loads).
    //
    // Consequence, accepted deliberately: until a masked frame exists, NOTHING draws. The overlay's own
    // canvas -- background, progress bar, phase label, stats -- is rasterized before and after this call
    // and is untouched by the refusal; the loading screen simply has no head on it yet. The worker
