// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE BRIDGE'S OWN ADMISSION RULE: "has this buffer been masked at all?"
//
// LOADING_BG_PORTRAIT_RGBA is a bare `(u32, u32, Vec<u8>)`. It carries no provenance, so a reader
// cannot ask WHO published a frame or WHETHER the depth key ran on it -- and it has more than one
// writer. The depth-keyed worker publishes masked frames; the game-thread bake capture in
// `save_swap_profile_table.rs` reads back the COLOUR offscreen alone (`readback_offscreen_rgba8`
// never touches the depth sibling), so every texel it publishes has alpha 255. That opaque frame
// then reached the compositor and the character's whole scene background was drawn to screen.
//
// The rule therefore lives HERE, next to the buffer, rather than in any one writer: whoever writes
// and whoever reads both answer the same question against the pixels themselves. That is also the
// only sound place for it, because the alternative gate -- the per-WINDOW `PROFILE_HAVE_KEYED_FRAME`
// flag -- cannot answer it. `portrait_retarget_and_rearm_for_switch` deliberately re-arms the bake
// one-shot on a switch load WITHOUT clearing that flag (so the make-before-break bridge keeps the
// prior head on screen), so from the second load onward the flag reads 1 while the buffer under it
// may be a brand-new unmasked capture. Alpha is per-buffer; the flag is not.
//
// BINARY, NOT A QUALITY SCORE. This asks only "did the mask cut ANYTHING", never "is the cutout
// good". bd `loading-portrait-live-path-deep-fix-2026-07-03` records a mask-INCOHERENCE scorer that
// was written, measured and REVERTED: it scored a noisy continuum and rejected 74% of frames that
// were fine. Mask quality already has its owners further up the pipeline (the worker's IoU
// gross-mismatch bar, its tear score, `apply_depth_alpha_key`'s own degenerate-mask rejection).
// This predicate exists for the one case none of them can see: a buffer the depth key never touched.

/// Minimum percent of transparent pixels a frame's mask must cut for the frame to count as keyed
/// (er-effects-rs-hi2): a real portrait mask removes a large background share; a partial mask
/// (few cut pixels on an opaque IBL box) previously passed "any transparent pixel" and displayed
/// as an unmasked head. 5% is far below any real mask's share and far above the partial band.
///
/// Moved here from `portrait_lookat` (2026-08-21) so the display half can apply the SAME number the
/// capture half does: `portrait_lookat` is `#[cfg(windows)]` and `portrait_overlay` is not, so a
/// compositor gate could not have referenced it there without either duplicating the constant --
/// two floors that drift apart is precisely the bug this closes -- or dragging the whole capture
/// module into host builds.

/// the number is a shared predicate, not a local threshold: the worker's floor test

/// frame the worker published as keyed could be refused at draw time and the head would vanish.

/// buffer, or with no separable depth gap, it deliberately leaves the frame fully opaque rather
