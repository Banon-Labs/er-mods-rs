// CAMERA LEVER (custom profile-portrait viewport). VERIFIED RE 2026-06-29 -- bd
// `camera-lever-RE-VERIFIED-offsets-and-call-addrs-2026-06-29`. The interactive-face roadmap's camera
// function addresses were garbled (dump-vs-deobf space confusion); these are ground-truthed against the
// Ghidra runtime dump (`pc_eldenring_runtime.1.16.1.exe`) + `scripts/dump-deobf-shift.py`.
//
// The `CSMenuProfModelRend` ctor (dump 0x140bbe010) sets the orbit camera ONCE from `MenuOffscrRendParam`
// via `FUN_140bbe190`, which (a) writes the orbit fields below, (b) builds a view matrix into `+0x9e0`
// via `FUN_140bbe480`, (c) pushes the CSPersCam (`+0x9d0`) into the offscreen render via `FUN_140bba550`.
// We replicate steps (b)+(c) AFTER writing our own orbit fields, and never call `FUN_140bbe190` itself
// (it re-reads the param and clobbers the orbit fields).
//
// All offsets are BYTE offsets from the renderer (CSMenuProfModelRend) base.
