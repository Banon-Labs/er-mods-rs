//! `CS::ChrAsm` member offsets the loading-portrait pipeline reads out of live game memory.
//!
//! Moved verbatim from er-quickload `constants/player_correctness.rs` with the loading-cover
//! extraction; the root re-exports every name through its `constants.rs` glob, so the flat
//! namespace is unchanged. Every offset is derived from the typed `fromsoftware-rs` layout
//! rather than hard-coded, so struct drift upstream fails the build instead of reading a
//! neighbouring field at runtime.
//!
//! DERIVED FROM A LAYOUT IS NOT THE SAME AS MEASURED, which is why every one of them now also
//! carries a `const _: () = assert!(.. == 0xNN)` against a number taken from the game's own
//! instructions. `offset_of!` asks the compiler, and the compiler only knows what the sibling
//! binding declares; the binding is a hand-written 1.16.2 model and its `unkNN` member names are
//! not reliable -- `FD4StepTemplateBase::unk48` is at 0x50, and back-solving a neighbour's offset
//! off that name is what put `CS_SYSTEM_STEP_CURRENT_STATE_OFFSET` at 0x40 for its whole life
//! (the field is 0x48; 0x40 is a live `DLAllocator*`, so the wrong read never faulted). Without a
//! pin, a layout edit upstream moves these silently and the only symptom is a portrait that
//! renders the wrong outfit.
//!
//! THE MEASUREMENT the pins freeze: `CS::ChrAsm::ChrAsm` (1.16.2 0x1403be1b0, 1.17 0x1403be1c0,
//! 161 bytes) aligns 38/38 instructions across the two de-Arxan'd images with SIX field offsets
//! -- 0x0, 0x4, 0x24, 0x7c, 0xd4, 0xdc -- every one HELD and none moved. Reproduce with
//! `scripts/pair-object-field-drift.py --pair 0x1403be1b0:161 0x1403be1c0:161 --base rcx
//! --base rsi`; the same rows are frozen in `scripts/check-object-field-offsets-1170.py`.
