// Portrait consume WORKER (loading-screen readback-stall offload, step 1, 2026-07-06).
// (This file is `include!`d into the gpu_readback module, so it uses `//` block comments, not `//!`.)
//
// The loading-screen portrait readback used to run its ENTIRE cost on the game RENDER THREAD:
// resolve+copy+WAIT+de-swizzle (all D3D12, synchronous) PLUS the pure-CPU MASK+CLASSIFY+PUBLISH
// (~17.5 ms/frame over ~250 frames == ~4.4 s of load-time stall at 1542x1542). This module moves ONLY
// the mask/classify/publish (pure CPU over plain `Vec<u8>`/`Vec<f32>`) onto a dedicated worker thread.
// The render thread KEEPS the D3D12 resolve+copy+WAIT+de-swizzle unchanged (so the game RT is released
// synchronously -- there is no async game-resource lifetime hazard).
//
// Threading contract: the worker ONLY ever touches plain `Vec<u8>`/`Vec<f32>` + atomics/Mutexes. It
// NEVER dereferences a game pointer or a D3D12 object -- every game-derived value the consume needs is
// snapshotted into the job on the render thread. Backpressure is a bounded channel (capacity 2): if the
// worker falls behind the render thread DROPS the frame (never blocks) and bumps a dropped counter.

/// A portrait frame handed from the render thread to the consume worker. ALL plain data -- no game
/// pointer and no D3D12 object crosses the thread boundary. Step 2: the render thread has already
/// resolved + copied + WAITED (so the game RT is released), leaving the raw copy in ring `slot`'s
