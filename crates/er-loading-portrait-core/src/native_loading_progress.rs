//! Is the game's own loading screen still MAKING PROGRESS, or is it frozen?
//!
//! This crate already samples the native `CS::LoadingScreen` every frame it ticks
//! ([`crate::dlstring_lookat_math::sample_loading_screen_bar`], which reads the Gauge_3 movieclip's
//! current/max frame straight out of the menu component). This module is the one question the
//! cover's backstop needs to ask of those samples, kept next to the code that produces them and
//! written as a pure function so it can be tested on the host rather than only in the game.
//!
//! # Why this exists (run br-20260831-160354-2513)
//!
//! The user drove one System->Quit->Load Character reload. It ended in
//! `boot-view: FPS BAIL stop (... composite_ms=20015 ...)` at boot-view 239858 ms -- the own-menu
//! epoch's 20 s composite cap. The native loading screen sent its own finish 501 ms later:
//! `loading-bar: native LoadingScreen finish/result sent (hits=2, frame=500/500, ..., now_ms=240359)`.
//! So a wall-clock budget pre-empted, by half a second, a release that was already arriving, and
//! filed the window as `oracle_boot_view_stop_reason=2` with the log text "handoff signals never
//! fired (frozen load2)" -- on a window whose handoff had fired 15 s earlier
//! (`boot-view: COVER RELEASE #2 at 224208ms`).
//!
//! ## The load was not frozen, and the gauge says so directly
//!
//! Across exactly the stretch the cover was accused of over-holding, the game's own gauge advanced
//! monotonically -- `frame=19/500` at +222605 ms, `72/500` at +227459 ms, `435/500` at +238084 ms,
//! terminal `500/500` at +241377 ms. A frozen load2, which is the failure the cap was added to
//! survive, cannot do that: its gauge stops. So "frozen" and "slow" are separable from RAM alone,
//! and the cap was not separating them -- it was reading a clock.
//!
//! This is the repo's own doctrine applied one level down. AGENTS.md, on runtime teardown:
//! "Distinguish a real hang (the `oracle_system_step_label` / loading substep FROZEN) from slow
//! progress (label still advancing); tear down only on a genuinely frozen substep", and "the time
//! bound is a safety backstop, NOT the primary synchronization mechanism".
//!
//! ## What this deliberately does NOT do
//!
//! It does not touch `BOOT_VIEW_NATIVE_LOADING_QUIET_HOLD_MS` (900 ms), the gate that actually held
//! the fade. That gate was correct: `CS::LoadingScreen::Update` really was ticking every frame,
//! because the screen really was still loading, and fading out over it is the vanilla flash-through
//! (er-effects-rs-wmw defect #1). The same run also PROVES the 900 ms is reachable -- the boot
//! window cleared it (`update_quiet` 2 ms -> 287 ms, then `native loading fade/quiet hold complete`
//! at +34384 ms and `release fade complete -> stop cover (... reason=1)`). Lowering it would have
//! released the cover onto a loading screen reading 39 %.
//!
//! And it does not extend a frozen window by one millisecond: with the gauge stuck,
//! [`CapDecision::bar_stalled`] is true and the cap fires exactly when it always did.
