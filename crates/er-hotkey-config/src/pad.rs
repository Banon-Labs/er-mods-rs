//! Controller chords -- the pad half of the hotkey vocabulary.
//!
//! This crate's [`Chord`](crate::keys::Chord) is `modifiers + one trigger key`, carried
//! in both Win32 virtual-key and DirectInput scancode numbering. A gamepad has neither numbering
//! and no notion of a modifier: "Select + Start" is two ordinary buttons held together, so the
//! natural representation is a BITMASK over `XINPUT_GAMEPAD.wButtons` and every button in it is
//! equal. Bolting a `pad: Option<u16>` onto `Chord` would have put a field on a type whose whole
//! shape is wrong for it, so this is a separate type instead.
//!
//! # The edge rule that differs from the keyboard
//!
//! `GetAsyncKeyState` has a low bit meaning "pressed since the previous call on this thread", so a
//! keyboard poll catches a press that happened AND was released between two polls. **XInput has no
//! such bit** -- `XInputGetState` reports only the state at the instant it is called. A pad chord
//! must therefore edge-detect against the previous poll's `wButtons`, and a press shorter than one
//! poll interval is genuinely invisible. Polling from the game's own menu update (which is where
//! this DLL reads it) means one poll per rendered frame, so that window is a frame.
//!
//! # Why it lives here and not in a DLL
//!
//! It was crate-private to `er-refill-all` until `er-npc-possess` needed the identical thing.
//! Copying it would have made two edge detectors with two chances to reintroduce the
//! phantom-press-on-rebind bug the tests below pin down, in a crate whose entire reason for
//! existing is that hotkey handling kept being reinvented differently each time.
