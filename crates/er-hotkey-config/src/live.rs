//! A binding a hook callback can read without taking a lock.
//!
//! The place a hotkey is actually MATCHED is inside a detour on the game's own keyboard read --
//! `IDirectInputDevice8::GetDeviceState`, or a `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` procedure. That code runs on
//! whatever thread the game happened to poll from, arbitrarily often, and while it runs the game is
//! waiting. Reaching for a `Mutex` there buys two problems for no benefit: a lock the reload path
//! also wants (so the game thread can be made to wait on a file read), and a poisoned lock if
//! anything above ever panics, which would silently stop the hotkey working for the rest of the
//! session.
//!
//! A [`Chord`] is three small numbers, so it fits in one `u64` and the whole question goes away.
