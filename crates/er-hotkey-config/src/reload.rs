//! Noticing that a config file changed, while the game is running.
//!
//! # Why the file's TEXT and not its mtime
//!
//! The obvious cheap check is the modification time, and this workspace used it twice. It has a
//! resolution problem: several filesystems -- and every network/VM share a Wine prefix is likely to
//! sit on -- stamp mtime to a whole second. Save a file twice inside one second and the second save
//! is invisible, which in this feature reads as "changing the key did nothing", the exact
//! indistinguishable-from-broken outcome the whole design is trying to avoid. Comparing the text
//! costs one read of a file measured in hundreds of bytes and cannot miss an edit.
//!
//! It also removes a second class of false positive: `touch`, a re-save with no changes, and this
//! DLL's own write-back of a setting all move mtime without changing anything. Each of those would
//! be reported as a reload, and a reload RESETS the key edge detector -- so a key held at that
//! moment fires again.
//!
//! # Why it is throttled, and not per frame
//!
//! The game task runs at ~60Hz and this is called from it. Reading a file sixty times a second to
//! notice an edit a human makes at most once a minute is a silly way to spend a frame budget, so a
//! poll inside [`DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`] of the last read costs one integer comparison and does
//! no I/O at all. A second is far below the threshold at which a person editing a file would call
//! it "not working", and far above the frame rate.
//!
//! # Testing
//!
//! [`HotFile::poll_with`] takes the clock and the read as arguments, so every decision this module
//! makes is provable on the host with no filesystem and no waiting. [`HotFile::poll`] is the thin
//! wrapper that supplies the real two.
