//! What a DLL does with a key name once the file it came from has changed.
//!
//! Three rules, and each exists because breaking it produces a failure the player cannot tell from
//! a broken feature:
//!
//! 1. **A malformed value keeps the previous working key.** Falling back to the built-in default
//!    silently moves the binding somewhere the player did not ask for; disabling the feature
//!    removes it entirely. Both leave a typo looking like a crash. [`BindingUpdate::Rejected`]
//!    carries the value that failed AND the key still in force, so the log line can say both.
//! 2. **A value that parses to the SAME key is not a change.** A reload resets the edge detector,
//!    and a reset while the key is held fires it again -- a press the player never made. Reformatting
//!    a config file, or writing `"f7"` where it said `"F7"`, must not do that.
//! 3. **A real change says so.** [`BindingUpdate::Changed`] carries both keys so the caller logs
//!    `F7 -> F8` rather than "the config reloaded", which is a fact nobody needs.
//!
//! The caller owns the edge state, so it owns the reset: `Changed` is the signal to clear it. See
//! [`BindingUpdate::changed`].
