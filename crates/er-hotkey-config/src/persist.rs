//! Writing one setting back into a config file the PLAYER also owns.
//!
//! # Why not just render the file
//!
//! Several of these DLLs change a setting from in-game and have to store it: a hotkey that toggles
//! a feature is worthless if the feature is off again on the next launch. The obvious
//! implementation -- keep the settings in a struct and write the struct out -- destroys the file.
//! These configs are mostly COMMENTS, and the comments are the feature's only documentation: what
//! the key names are, which SpEffect row is which, a commented-out alternative left in place for
//! the player to re-enable later. A renderer emits the four keys it knows about and every one of
//! those is gone, silently, the first time the player presses the key.
//!
//! So [`set_scalar`] does the other thing: it copies the file through byte for byte and rewrites
//! exactly one line. Comments, blank lines, ordering, indentation, trailing comments, keys this
//! build has never heard of and lines that are commented out all survive, because nothing ever
//! looks at them.
//!
//! # Why the write is staged and renamed
//!
//! [`write_atomic`] writes a sibling temp file and renames it over the destination. `fs::write` is
//! truncate-then-write: a crash or a full disk part way through leaves a config that is neither
//! the old one nor the new one, and the parser's own tolerance makes that WORSE rather than better
//! -- a half-written file usually still parses, into something the player did not ask for. Every
//! failure of the staged form instead ends with the destination holding exactly its previous
//! contents.
//!
//! The rename is also what makes the write invisible to a reader that catches it mid-flight: the
//! game re-reads this file about once a second (see [`crate::reload::HotFile`]), and on the
//! target these DLLs actually ship to -- a Windows PE under Wine -- `fs::rename` is `MoveFileExW`
//! with `MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING`, which Wine services with `rename(2)` on the underlying Linux
//! filesystem. A reader sees the old file or the new one, never a partial one.
//!
//! # The lost update this does NOT solve
//!
//! Read-modify-write is not a lock. If the player's editor saves between the read and the rename,
//! the rename wins and their save is gone. That window is microseconds wide and there is no
//! portable way to close it here; the mitigation is that only ONE line is ever rewritten, so
//! everything the two writers disagree about is confined to that key. The caller should re-read
//! after writing and adopt what came back -- [`crate::reload::HotFile::adopt`] -- which both keeps
//! its own write from reading as somebody's edit and picks up an edit that landed just before it.
