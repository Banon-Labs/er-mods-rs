//! Everything here is `f32` in, `f32` out, with no game and no `windows` crate, so it is proven

//! `aspect` looks, in game, exactly like "the overlay is broken", and diagnosing it from a
//! screenshot costs a launch. Here it costs a test.

// Every non-test consumer of this module is `cfg(windows)`, so on the host it is structurally
// dead and the allow is unavoidable. What keeps that from HIDING a genuinely unused item -- the
// failure bd `host-build-cfg-gate-allow-pattern-hides-real-lints-2026-08-23` records against
// er-title-flow -- is that dead_code is still DENIED on the shipping target, where the windows
// modules are compiled and every one of these has a caller. A tighter `not(test)` variant was
// tried first and is wrong: it makes `cargo test` on the host fail for items whose only callers
// are cross-compiled, which is not a defect.
