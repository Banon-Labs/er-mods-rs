//! Asking Elden Ring's own Havok-AI navmesh for a walkable route between two points.
//!
//! # Why the engine's pathfinder and not our own
//!
//! "Walkable" is not a property of the terrain mesh, it is a property of the navmesh the game
//! authored for that map: where an NPC may drop, which ledges are edges, which doorways connect.
//! Any route we computed ourselves would be a second opinion about walkability, and it would be
//! wrong exactly where it matters -- the cliff that looks crossable and is not. So this asks the
//! same `CSHkAiWorld` the game's own characters ask, and draws its answer.
//!
//! # The call chain, and where it came from
//!
//! Reversed out of `CS::CSAiFunc`'s path request (`FUN_1402ea2f0`, `0x1402ea2f0`) against ER
//! 1.16.2, where the dump VA, the `eldenring-deobf.bin` VA and the live runtime VA are all
//! identical (shift 0). The sequence is:
//!
//! 1. [`PARAMS_INIT_RVA`] fills a 0x34-byte request-parameter block with defaults.
//! 2. [`RESOLVE_POINT_RVA`] snaps a world position onto the navmesh, returning the snapped point
//!    and the `(section, face)` pair it landed in. Called once for the start, once for the end.
//! 3. [`REFINE_START_RVA`] adjusts the START point/face pair.
//! 4. [`REQUEST_RVA`] enqueues the search under the world's own mutex and returns a request id.
//!    Zero means it refused.
//! 5. [`IS_READY_RVA`] polls that id; [`FETCH_RVA`] then drains the finished route into a
//!    container and returns a status, where **2 is a complete route**.
//!
//! The search itself runs on the AI world's job, not on our thread -- which is why this is a
//! two-phase state machine rather than a function that returns a path.
//!
//! # Honest status
//!
//! Every address and every structure offset below is derived from static RE and cross-checked
//! against two independent call sites. None of it has been executed against a live game yet, so
//! the container walk in [`read_waypoints`] validates everything it reads (capacity is a power of
//! two, count is bounded, every element pointer is non-null, every coordinate is finite and
//! plausible) and refuses rather than trusting. A refusal degrades to the direction arrow, which
//! is the same thing the feature does for a genuinely unreachable player.
