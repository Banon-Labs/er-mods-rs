//! Spawning the game's own visual effects at world positions.
//!
//! Everything else in this DLL draws with imgui, in screen space, over the finished frame. That
//! is why the line looks painted on the glass: it does not occlude behind a hill, it takes no
//! light, and it is unmistakably not part of the game. An FXR spawned through the engine's own
//! SFX manager is a real effect in the world -- correct depth, correct lighting, the look the
//! game already has.
//!
//! # This is the one thing here that CHANGES the game
//!
//! The rest of this crate reads. This spawns. It is a real engine object with a real lifetime,
//! and the module-level claim that this DLL does nothing to the game stops being true the moment
//! `marker_fxr_id` is set to something other than zero. That is why it is off by default.
//!
//! Whether a Seamless Co-op session replicates one of these to other players is **not known**. If
//! it does, a trail of markers pointing at an invader is a trail pointing back at you. Until
//! somebody watches a second client while these spawn, treat that as an open question rather than
//! a solved one.
