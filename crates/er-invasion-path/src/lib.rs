//! A walkable path to every other player in your session, drawn on the ground they would walk.
//!
//! Press the configured key (or use the configured item) during an invasion and every other
//! player in the session gets a coloured route from your feet to theirs, laid along the terrain,
//! bolder the closer they are. A player the navmesh cannot reach from where you stand gets a
//! glowing arrow out of your body pointing straight at them instead. A player who is both close
//! and in plain sight gets nothing -- you can already see them.
//!
//! # What makes the line trustworthy
//!
//! The route is not ours. It is the answer `CSHkAiWorld` gives its own characters when they ask
//! how to walk somewhere, so it goes around the cliff rather than off it. See [`navpath`] for the
//! call chain and where each address came from.
//!
//! # What this DLL does to the game
//!
//! Nothing. No detours, no memory writes, no param edits (which is what breaks Seamless
//! invasions), no input injection, no network traffic. It reads the roster, asks the navmesh a
//! question, and draws. It ships as its own ME3 `[[natives]]` entry and shares no state with any
//! other module in this workspace.

// Ungated on purpose: the config parser, the projection maths and the colour bookkeeping are pure
// and are exercised by `cargo test` on the host, where the game-facing modules compile out.
