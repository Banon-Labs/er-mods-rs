// DLC VIRTUAL ROOT SELF-HEAL -- the profile-switch reload softlock fix.
//
// PROVEN CAUSE (bd `FORK-RESOLVED-refill-job-never-enqueued-on-reload-fix-is-gated-self-heal-2026-07-30`):
// the title start-game flow re-registers the 13 `*_dlc2` DLIO aliases with an EMPTY root on EVERY
// pass (`FUN_140e06490`), but the job that repopulates them (`FUN_140e05fb0` via the MenuFunctorJob
// whose `_Do_call` is `FUN_140836f30`) is enqueued only on boot. Measured, one run:
//     BLANK #1 (boot) -> JOB #1 -> REFILL #1 -> roots populated
//     BLANK #2 (reload) -> no JOB #2, no REFILL #2 -> roots EMPTY
// A `mapstudio_dlc2:/m28_*.msb` read then resolves against an empty root and returns 0 bytes, the
// sole `msbResCap` writer short-circuits on null content, and `WorldBlockRes` case 2 waits forever.
//
// WHY THIS CALLS A NATIVE FUNCTION INSTEAD OF ENQUEUEING THE NATIVE JOB: the enqueue chain is a
// closed loop -- `FUN_140836f30` is the `_Do_call` of a functor that `FUN_14082faf0` builds, and
// `FUN_14082faf0` is reachable only from that same loop. Every link is DATA-dispatched with no
// static call site, so there is no enqueue owner to invoke (independently reproduces the July
// finding "dynamically-built std::function, no static registration"). `FUN_140e05fb0` is
// self-contained -- it re-queries Steam DLC ownership through `dlcPlatform` vtable[8]/[0xb]/[0xc],
// rewrites every root 0..0x31 via `AddVirtualFileRoots`, and sets the `+0x45` valid latch -- so
// calling it is not a private per-frame pump of a MenuJob queue.
//
// GATE: the observed POPULATED -> EMPTY transition, NOT a timer and NOT `CSDlcImp+0x45` alone.
//   * `+0x45` is legitimately 0 during early boot before the game's own first refill, so gating on
//     it would fire before Steam DLC ownership is established.
//   * That earliness is not cosmetic: `AddVirtualFileRoots` silently substitutes `L"system:/"` when
//     `CS_DLC_IsEnableDlcFileMount` is false or ownership is unresolved. A too-early call would
//     "succeed", set `+0x45 = 1`, and leave DLC content resolving to the WRONG root -- a silent
//     corruption strictly worse than a visible softlock.
// Requiring a prior good observation means we only ever act on a root the game itself had already
// populated correctly, and only after it was destroyed.
//
// PROOF OBLIGATION: "we called the refill" is NOT success. The heal verifies the resulting string
// equals the expected `map_dlc2:/mapstudio` -- `L"system:/"` is non-empty and wrong, so a
// non-empty check would pass the exact failure this gate exists to prevent.
