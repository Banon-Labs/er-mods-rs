// er-title-flow: title/autoload/switch orchestration extracted from the root DLL
// (docs/plans/title-flow-crate-extraction.md). Flat include! layout preserved from
// the source module so diffs stay reviewable; `compat` is the single seam that maps
// the old root-crate glob imports onto this crate's own constants, the shared
// crates, and the `host` function-pointer boundary. title_load_step_hooks.rs is the
// verbatim head of the source title_tick_cover.rs, split at a function boundary so
// both files clear the repo's hard file-size gate.
// PARITY: DEBT -- see constants_moved.rs; the split that created these two files kept the
// import blocks intact so the diff read as a move rather than a rewrite.
#![allow(unused_imports)]
// PARITY: DEBT -- this suppresses clippy::missing_safety_doc (a clippy::all lint) for the
// WHOLE crate, so this crate's reported zero rests on it rather than on written contracts.
// The unsafe fns here read live game memory and each needs a real `# Safety` section.
#![allow(clippy::missing_safety_doc)]
// WINDOWS-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION, AND THE RUST SIDE HAS TO SAY SO. Cargo already pulls the game
// bindings (`eldenring`, `fromsoftware-shared`, `er-hook`, `er-loading-portrait-core`, `er-save-loader`,
// `er-tpf`, `windows`) only under `[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies]`; until 2026-08-23 the
// source imported them unconditionally, so a HOST `cargo test -p er-effects-rs --lib` died with 31
// unresolved-import errors that read like the caller's own change had broken something. `check.sh`
// runs this suite through `cargo xwin test --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, so the shipping target
// always satisfied the imports and nothing ever went red. `boot_hold` and the constant table stay
// host-visible on purpose -- they are pure predicates/data and carry this crate's host-runnable
// tests.
//
// NOTE the absence of the sibling shells' `#![cfg_attr(not(windows), allow(dead_code,
// unused_imports))]` (er-armament-icons et al). Those crates need it because a host build compiles
// their shell with its only callers cfg'd out; here the host build is `boot_hold` plus the plain
// constant table, every item `pub`, and it is warning-CLEAN under the workspace
// `[workspace.lints.rust] warnings = "deny"` (verified 2026-08-23). Adding the allow anyway would
// hide nothing today and real host debt tomorrow, so it is deliberately not here.

// Autoload/own-load/own-stepper cluster moved out of the root crate on 2026-08-25 (the

// `use crate::compat::*;` header as the files above; only visibility changed
// (`pub(crate)` -> `pub`) so the root crate's `experiments::title` glob shim keeps every
// old call site resolving. The three `constants_*` tables were `include!`d into the root
// crate's `constants.rs` and are kept as separate files rather than folded into
// `constants_moved.rs`, which would push that file past the 3,200-line hard size gate.
