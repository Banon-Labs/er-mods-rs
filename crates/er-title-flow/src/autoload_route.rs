//! Which load path the title-time autoload tick takes.
//!
//! # The fork this exists to narrow
//!
//! There are two ways this mod can put a character in the world from the title, and until
//! 2026-08-26 the choice between them was made by one predicate -- "is a direct/loose save file
//! the source?" -- which is not the question that decides whether either path can work.
//!
//! * [`TitleAutoloadRoute::NativeContinue`] fires the game's own Continue row. The native chain
//!   then runs `SetState5` -> world load -> `CS::MoveMapStep::DoSaveStuff`, which deserialises the
//!   save **in-world**, natively, with every precondition its own caller establishes. This is what
//!   the DEFAULT save has always done, and it works.
//!
//! * [`TitleAutoloadRoute::TitleTimeFullRead`] is ours: submit / drain / **deserialise at the
//!   title**, which calls `0x14067b290`. That function has exactly ONE caller in the whole image,
//!   `CS::MoveMapStep::DoSaveStuff`, reachable only from `MoveMapStep::Update` -- the in-world
//!   step. Calling it from the boot title is calling it outside every precondition its only caller
//!   sets up, and a picked save died there (`gaitemInsTable[-1]` AV at `0x67141a`). Four separate
//!   attempts to GATE those preconditions each moved the fault one step later and never removed it,
//!   which is what a wrong-place call looks like from the inside.
//!
//! So the route is not "picked save vs default save". It is "can the native Continue row be used
//! at all?", and the answer to THAT is whether the picked slot's `CS::ProfileSummary` record is
//! real -- because the native Continue path reads the summary to decide what to load, and the boot
//! save-data job never populated it for a container the user picked afterwards.
//!
//! The full-read stays as the narrow fallback for the one case that has no summary and no way to
//! get one (an explicit loose `save_file` at boot, before any summary exists). Everything else must
//! go down the same native path the default save does.
