//! The Save Game row: what it writes, what it asks first, and how it closes afterwards.
//!
//! Save Game is a vanilla row. The mod clones two character rows onto the same tab and adds a
//! third for a build link, but this one ships with the game, and the flow behind it is the save
//! path -- request a write, retract a request the player backed out of, close the menus the write
//! left open, then take the title back. `lifecycle/save_flow.rs` drives all of it and was already
//! the only reader of most of these.
//!
//! Moved out of `quit_menu/system_quit_dialog_handlers.rs`, which held this flow, the Scaleform
//! handler lifetime hooks and the picked-save ingest in one file. Pure move, no behaviour change.

// Reached through `quit_menu`'s glob until the rows became a feature. These three are the
// vanilla Save Game row's own text, and `er-quit-menu-core` owns them.

/// for the 1.16.2 -> 1.17 map to key on. That is not a gap in the map; it is a property of the
/// band. Measured across the 33 `.pdata` functions it overlaps: 12 are unmapped outright and the
/// 21 that map move by seven different deltas (`+0xdf0`, `+0xe20`, `+0xe30`, `+0xe40`, `+0xe80`,
/// `+0xe90`, `+0x1560`). A band whose contents move apart has no translated width, so no anchor
/// rescues it -- unlike the GX transport band, whose 12 functions all move `+0x1e00` together and
/// which is therefore anchored rather than refused.
///
/// It is also the weakest-evidenced comparison in the tree. `SYSTEM_QUIT_RETURN_TITLE_REQUEST_RVA`
/// (`0x67a3a0`) has exactly one direct caller in the whole 1.16.2 image, at `0x59d90e` inside
/// `FUN_14059d8b0`, which is nowhere near this band; nothing records what the band was measured
/// from. So the honest treatment is to decline on any build it was not measured on and say so,
/// rather than invent a 1.17 window. The branch it guards is documented dormant -- the product row
/// path clears the arming latch before this hook runs -- so declining costs a safety net that
