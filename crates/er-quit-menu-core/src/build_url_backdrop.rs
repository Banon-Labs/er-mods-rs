//! Proof that the dim behind the **Load Build from URL** link field reached the running movie.
//!
//! The dim itself is authored offline, in [`er_gfx::build_url_backdrop`]: a second placement of the
//! movie's own black plate, on the root, under the field's sprite. Nothing in this file draws it.
//! What this file does is answer the two questions a build success cannot.
//!
//! # Did the bytes we handed Scaleform carry it
//!
//! [`attest_derived_build_url_backdrop`] re-parses the derived payload at the moment the MemoryFile
//! swap installs it and looks for the placement by name and depth. A derivation that silently lost
//! it -- a future vanilla payload whose root is shaped differently, a tag the writer refused --
//! shows up here as a count and a log line rather than as a field that went up undimmed.
//!
//! # Did the running movie keep it
//!
//! [`probe_live_build_url_backdrop`] resolves the dim's instance name on the live `MenuWindow`
//! root through `assignComponentWithName`, the same native binder that reaches the editable field.
//! This is the part that was unmeasured: no edit in this repo had added a root-level child to
//! `02_990` before, and the native `CS::SoftwareKeyboard` controller is documented to reconstruct
//! its own child after parsing. If it rebuilds the whole root instead, the dim is in the bytes and
//! not on the screen, and `_derived` rising while `_resolved` stays at zero is what says so.
//!
//! # What neither of them proves
//!
//! Pixels. A resolved display object is a display object, not a darker screen. The rectangle it
//! covers is emitted alongside the counters (`oracle_build_url_backdrop_stage_rect`) so a luma
//! probe knows where to sample and which part -- the field's own plate -- to exclude.
