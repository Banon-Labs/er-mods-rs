//
// They used to read "Load Profile" and "Load Save Profiles", which a reviewer could not tell apart:
// "I'm not clear on the difference between Load Profile and Load Save Profiles. It looks like Load
// Save Profiles will load a character profile and then you have access to that character's saves.
// Does it make more sense to call this 'Load Character' or 'Load Character Profile'?"
//
// The guess was inverted -- it is the OTHER row that ends in a character list -- and that inversion
// is the evidence the words were wrong, not just similar. So each row is now named after what it
// takes as INPUT: a character out of the container already loaded, or a file off the disk.
//
// BOTH FIT, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. The Quit-tab cell renders its label through
// `02_040_optionsetting.gfx` sprite 129 -> `Text_0` -> sprite 96 -> `DefineEditText` char 95, whose
// bounds are -40..7960 twips = 400px at a 24px `MenuFont_01`, single-line with wordwrap OFF -- an
// overflow would CLIP, not wrap, so it would silently eat the tail.
// `scripts/gfx_text_width.py --height-px 24 --box-px 400` sums that font's own advance table:
// "Load Character" 144.5px, "Load Character from File" 234.6px, against the native "Return to
// Desktop" at 172.8px which is known to render on this row. Nothing is near the edge, so no
// placement matrix and no row width was touched. The line-help field on the same tab (char 87,
// -40..22760 twips = 1140px, also 24px) has room to spare for the help strings below.
