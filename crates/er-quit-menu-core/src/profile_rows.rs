//! THE PROFILESELECT LIST CURSOR IS A ROW INDEX, NOT A PROFILESUMMARY SLOT.
//!
//! `05_010_ProfileSelect` lists only the character slots that EXIST. The game builds its row list
//! in `FUN_140875590` (1.16.2, byte-identical in `eldenring-deobf.bin` at the same VA) by walking
//! slots `0..10` and pushing a `CS::MenuSaveDataSummary` **only** where
//! `ProfileSummary->saveSlotsStates[slot]` is set:
//!
//! ```text
//!   iVar5 = 0;
//!   do {
//!     if (FUN_140261cd0(GetProfileSummary(), iVar5))   // saveSlotsStates[slot]
//!       push(FUN_1408752c0(&tmp, iVar5));              // row remembers its slot at +8
//!     iVar5 = iVar5 + 1;
//!   } while (iVar5 < 10);
//! ```
//!
//! So the row at list index `i` describes slot `rows[i]`, and `i == rows[i]` only when the
//! container's characters happen to run densely from slot 0. `CS::ProfileLoadDialog::load_activate`
//! (`0x1409a4670`) never confuses the two -- it reads the cursor, clamps it, fetches the ROW and
//! takes the slot from the row:
//!
//! ```text
//!   1409a46b9: call 0x140739e20            ; cursor = [dialog+0xa38+0xd4] == [dialog+0xb0c]
//!   1409a46c0: test eax,eax / js  ...      ; cursor < 0        -> row 0
//!   1409a46c4: cmp  eax,[rdi+0xb08] / jg   ; cursor >= bound   -> row 0
//!   1409a46d5: call qword [rax+0x90]       ; list = dialog->vt[+0x90](dialog)
//!   ...        call qword [r8 +0x20]       ; row  = list->vt[+0x20](list, row_index)
//!   ...        mov  eax,[rax+8]            ; slot = row->save_slot
//! ```
//!
//! This module owns the two pure decisions that sit either side of those native calls, so they are
//! `cargo test`-able instead of only observable in game:
//!
//! * [`profile_select_row_for_cursor`] -- the exact clamp above, so a caller asks the native row
//!   accessor for the same row the native activation would have used;
//! * [`preview_cursor_slot`] -- after a foreign save is previewed, WHICH slot the cursor should be
//!   parked on.
//!
//! # The bug this closes
//!
//! `system_quit_profile_load_activate_hook` fed the raw cursor to `profile_slot_has_character` and
//! to the foreign-preview commit as though it were a slot. A save whose only character sits in slot
//! 3 previews as a one-row list, the user presses A on row 0, and the mod asked "does slot 0 hold a
//! character" -- it does not, so the pick was refused with `slot holds no character`, six times in a
//! row, while the native `load_activate` in the very same frame built the load job for slot 3
//! (`loadgame-builder: 0x140826510 built for slot=3`, measured 2026-08-25). Any container whose
//! characters are not dense from slot 0 was unloadable through the menu.
