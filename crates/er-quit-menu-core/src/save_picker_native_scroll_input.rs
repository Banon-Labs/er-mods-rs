//! The native `05_010` list's own input and geometry, rebased so ten row models can represent a
//! listing of any length.
//!
//! Split out of `save_picker_menu` on 2026-09-11 when that file crossed the hard size limit. The
//! seam is not arbitrary: everything here is a detour on, or a direct read of, the game's own list
//! control -- the vertical menu-event ids, the cursor setter, the wheel delta, the point-to-index
//! hit test, and the grid's view base. The picker's own logic lives next door and calls into this.
//!
//! # Why the list is lied to rather than resized
//!
//! `ProfileSelect` stages exactly ten `ProfileSummary` rows, and the compact picker keeps it that
//! way: changing the native `GridControl` item count changes what the game believes about every
//! other surface built from the same template. So a long directory is a moving ten-row window over
//! the model, and these hooks are what keep the native control's idea of the cursor, the wheel and
//! the hit target consistent with a window that slides underneath it.

/// `+107911ms`), so there is no tick on which the pump can ask "did the game already take this one?"
/// and get a true answer. Deferring by a fixed number of ticks just moves the guess.
///
/// So do not arbitrate: remove one of the two mechanisms. Zeroing the delta here makes the wheel
/// branch in `FUN_14073a5c0` (`if (delta.col != 0 || delta.row != 0)`) fall through, so the native
/// grid performs no view scroll and no cursor move at all, and the pump is the sole owner of the
/// wheel with no timing assumption anywhere. It also removes the reason the wheel was uneven in the
/// first place: the native step was gated on the grid's own view base being able to move, which is
/// false at a clamp, so the game was an unreliable owner even when it was the only one.
///
/// Scoped to the picker's own screen, and it silences a read rather than dropping the user's input:
/// the direction is latched into `SAVE_PICKER_NATIVE_WHEEL_EDGES` on the way past, so the detent
/// still reaches the picker. Every other menu keeps its native wheel exactly as designed.
///
/// # Why the latch is here and not only in the host
///
/// It used to be only in the host: the product reads `GetRawInputData` and answers
/// `take_nav_edges_for`. A standalone shell installs no such reader -- `er-save-game-row` leaves
/// every `SavePickerMenuHooks` field `None` -- so this detour silenced the game's wheel and handed
/// the notch to nobody, which made the picker's wheel strictly worse than vanilla's. Run

/// because this is the one place a notch is observed no matter who loaded the DLL.
///

/// Neutralise the view base for the grid's pointer hit test, the same way the select hook does for
/// the select itself.
///
/// The hit test walks the visible cells and turns the one under the pointer into an absolute item
/// index by adding the view base, then discards the hit if that index is past the item count:
///
///     140736d41  MOV  R11D, [RSI + 0x348]   ; view row base
///     140736d80  LEA  EDI, [R10 + R11*1]    ; view row + base
///     140736daf  CMP  [RSI + 0xd0], EDI     ; count vs index
///     140736db5  JLE  ...                   ; index >= count -> report no hit
///
/// The picker keeps its model's scroll offset in that base so the native scrollbar thumb tracks a
/// listing far longer than the ten staged records (`save-picker: native scrollbar sync`). For the
/// hit test that offset is poison: with base 10 against 10 records every visible cell computes an
/// index >= count, so the pointer hits nothing, nothing is selected, and the game's click
/// activation has nothing to act on. Clicking therefore worked only while the scrollbar sat at the
/// very top, where the base happens to be 0 -- reported 2026-08-12, and the same shape as the wheel
/// dying at a clamped base.
///
/// Zeroing the base for the duration of the call makes the hit test return a view-relative index
/// `0..9`, which is exactly the space the ten staged records live in and the space the select hook
/// already leaves `+0xd4` in. The base is restored immediately afterwards, so the scrollbar thumb is
/// unaffected.
