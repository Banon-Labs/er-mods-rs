//! Opening the game's own `05_010_ProfileSelect` character picker over a live System dialog.
//!
//! This is the entry point behind two of the cloned Quit rows. **Load Character** submits the
//! window over the container already loaded; **Load Character from File** stages a browse listing
//! into `CS::ProfileSummary` first and then submits the same window, so one opener serves both.
//!
//! # Why it is a submit and not a call
//!
//! `05_010_ProfileSelect` is a `CS::MenuWindowJob`, and the game's menu pump is the only thing
//! allowed to run one. The native wrapper at [`er_title_flow::PROFILE_SELECT_WRAPPER_RVA`] builds
//! the job into a caller-supplied slot; [`er_title_flow::MENU_JOB_SUBMIT_RVA`] hands that slot to a
//! queue. Both arguments come from the System dialog the row was pressed on:
//!
//! * `dialog + 0x10` is the dialog's own `MenuJobQueue`, so the submitted window is owned by the
//!   menu that opened it and is torn down with it;
//! * `dialog + 0x50` is the `DLFixedVector<8>` of owning `MenuWindow`s that `MenuWindowJob::Run`
//!   appends the loaded window to. Passing the `SceneObjProxy` back-reference here instead lets the
//!   resource load start and then asserts inside `DLFixedVector.inl` when `Run` appends to an
//!   object that is not that vector, which is why the count at `+0x48` is screened first.
//!
//! # What is checked before anything is called
//!
//! Every read is fault-safe and every refusal is a logged `false` rather than a guess, because the
//! two callers reach this from a menu-thread row press where a wrong pointer is a crash rather than
//! a wrong pixel:
//!
//! * the dialog is heap-like;
//! * its embedded `SceneObjProxy` carries the `CS::SceneObjProxy` vtable, which is what proves the
//!   pointer really is a System dialog and not another dialog at the same address;
//! * the owning-window vector has room;
//! * both native addresses resolve on the running build.
