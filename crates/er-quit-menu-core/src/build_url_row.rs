//! The System>Quit **Load Build from URL** row.
//!
//! The importer itself lives in `er-build-import-runtime`, which the standalone
//! `er-build-import` shell also drives. This module is only the row's two halves inside the
//! product DLL: the press, which hands the runtime a URL, and the per-frame tick, which is the game
//! thread the runtime needs in order to touch anything.
//!
//! # Why the press cannot just do the import
//!
//! The press arrives on whichever thread dispatched the menu activation, inside a native
//! `PropertyNewButtonController` action. The import mutates the inventory, the `CSGaitemImp`
//! singleton, `PlayerGameData` and the equipment slots, and it begins with a blocking HTTPS get.
//! Neither belongs there. So the press only calls `request`, which spawns the fetch worker and
//! returns; the recurring `FrameBegin` task then applies the parsed build once the game can take it
//! (params streamed, character in the world). That split is the runtime's whole shape, and this row
//! reuses it rather than inventing a second one.
//!
//! # Where the URL comes from
//!
//! The row opens a link field ([`build_url_editor`]) pre-filled from the clipboard, and imports
//! what the player accepts. `build_url` in the game-directory `er-quickload.toml` is still read -- it
//! seeds nothing here, but the boot importer uses it, and an accepted link is written back to it so
//! the next session starts from the last build that worked.
