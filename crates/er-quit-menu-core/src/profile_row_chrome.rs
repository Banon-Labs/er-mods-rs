//! Which fields of a `05_010_ProfileSelect` row are on screen, and whether the row is one of ours.
//!
//! Moved out of `er-quickload` on 2026-09-11 so the System>Quit **Load Character from File** row
//! can dress its browse surface with no product DLL behind it. The picker itself moved the day
//! before; this is the chrome that makes its rows read as files rather than as characters.
//!
//! # Why a row states the full answer rather than only what it wants gone
//!
//! The seven native row clips are recycled. A clip that showed `[ up .. ]` renders a save file two
//! scrolls later, and the same movie can outlive the picker window, so a row that hides only the
//! fields it dislikes inherits the previous row's content in every field it did not mention. That
//! was observed twice: the attribute line bled onto browse rows, and then the drive labels bled
//! onto character rows. Every field any row kind writes therefore appears in one statement, and
//! each drive button frame is paired with its text -- hiding only the label leaves an empty
//! clickable-looking button behind.
