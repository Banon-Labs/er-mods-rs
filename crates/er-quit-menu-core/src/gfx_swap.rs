//! The two Scaleform movies the System>Quit rows stand on, derived in place from the game's own
//! vanilla payload.
//!
//! Moved out of `er-quickload`'s `experiments/startup_hooks/loading_cover/profile_table_gfx_files.rs`,
//! which still serves the loading cover, the title `05_000` and the profile table `05_010` from the
//! same file-open observer. Only the quit-menu half is here, because only the quit-menu half is
//! what a standalone quit-menu shell has to serve when the product is absent:
//!
//! * `02_040_optionsetting` -- the Quit Game panel's grid. Vanilla ships two cells and the mod's
//!   rows are cells three through six, so a shell that clones rows without this swap clones into
//!   cells that do not exist;
//! * `02_990_textinput` -- the link field the **Load Build from URL** row opens, under its own
//!   Scaleform cache key.
//!
//! # One deriver, by construction
//!
//! `er_gfx::options_02_040::quit6` fail-closes when its input is not the vanilla movie
//! (`Quit6Error::KnownInputBadOutput`), so a second deriver handed already-derived bytes correctly
//! refuses. That is why `scripts/me3-dll-conflicts.toml` pairs `er-quit-menu` with `er-quickload`
//! as a duplicate owner rather than a shared hook: whichever of them is loaded is the sole deriver,
//! and they are never loaded together.
