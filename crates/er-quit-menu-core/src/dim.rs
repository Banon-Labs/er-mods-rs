// The screen dim that covers the game while the OS-native save picker is up.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AS A SEPARATE WINDOW AND NOT A GAME-RENDER-PATH OVERLAY. `save_picker_os_dialog`
// calls `GetOpenFileNameW`/`GetSaveFileNameW` INLINE on the thread that owns the menu pump, and that
// is deliberate (see the threading note at the top of that file). The consequence is measured, not
// theorised: in the user's live run product-continue-direct-20260730-075054 the dialog was up for
// 17.2 seconds (OPENED +35773ms -> CLOSED +53001ms, cancelled) and the game emitted ZERO game-side
// log lines across the whole window -- one gap alone was 10472ms of nothing. Present is NOT called
// while the dialog is up. So there is no frame to draw into: a Present hook, a CSTask, a MenuJob and
// every other per-frame game path are all frozen for the dialog's entire lifetime. An overlay that
// can ANIMATE while that is true must live on a thread WE own, in a window WE own.
//
// WHY GDI AND NOT A SECOND D3D12 DEVICE. `er-loading-portrait-core`'s `native_overlay` proves the window
// half of this shape (topmost borderless, own swapchain), but it brings up a whole D3D12 device. Two
// reasons not to copy that here. First, an opaque swapchain cannot DIM -- it can only replace, and
// the user asked to still see the game underneath. A layered window with per-pixel alpha composites
// black at partial alpha, which is what "dim" actually means. Second, this overlay is created while
// the game thread is parked inside comdlg32; standing up a vkd3d device at that exact moment adds
// driver and allocator surface for no benefit. `UpdateLayeredWindow` over a DIB section is pure GDI,
// needs no device, and the compositor does the blend.
//
// Z-ORDER (the requirement that is easiest to get backwards). We must sit ABOVE the game and BELOW
// the dialog. That is why this window is NOT `WS_EX_TOPMOST`: the topmost band beats every ordinary
// window, so a topmost dim would cover the very dialog the user has to click.
//
// THE ORDERING IS NOW OWNERSHIP, NOT TIMING (2026-07-31, user-reported: "the file picker must be on
// top of the blur", and "the blur must be attached to Elden Ring so I can't move it
// independently"). The previous shape raised to `HWND_TOP` once and relied on comdlg32's window
// being created AFTER that raise. That claim was never enforced by anything: `arm` published a
// generation and returned immediately, the caller went straight into `GetOpenFileNameW`, and the
// raise was issued by the OVERLAY thread up to a whole frame period (33 ms) later -- comfortably
// long enough for the dialog to already exist, at which point the raise puts the cover ON TOP OF
// the dialog. Two changes replace that race with window-manager invariants:
//
//  1. THE COVER IS AN OWNED POPUP OF THE ER WINDOW (`attach_to_game`). An owned window is always
//     above its owner, so the cover can no longer fall behind the game whatever the z-order does;
//     and Wine maps the owner onto the native transient/parent relation (X11 `WM_TRANSIENT_FOR`,
//     Wayland `xdg_toplevel` parent), which is what tells a compositor this window belongs to the
//     game rather than being something to drag around on its own.
//  2. THE DIALOG IS OWNED BY THE COVER (`os_dialog_owner`), so the full chain is
//     game < cover < dialog and no raise of ours can get in front of comdlg32.
//
// NOT `WS_CHILD`, which would be the strongest "attached" of all -- genuinely clipped to and moved
// with the parent. Two reasons it is the wrong tool here. `UpdateLayeredWindow` wants a TOP-LEVEL
// layered window; layered CHILD windows are a much later and much thinner platform feature, and
// this runs on Wine's reimplementation, not on Windows. And a GDI child window does not composite
// over a D3D12 swapchain -- the parent presents straight past it. An owned popup keeps its own
// surface, which is the thing that actually has to work, and still gets the attachment.
//
// `arm` now BLOCKS on an atomic handshake until the overlay thread reports the cover up at the
// game's geometry, so "the cover exists and is positioned before comdlg32 is called" is true by
// construction rather than by hope -- which also matters because comdlg32 centres the dialog on its
// owner, and centring on a not-yet-positioned 1x1 window would drop the picker in the desktop's
// top-left corner. `SAVE_PICKER_DIM_Z_*` still samples the resulting order every frame so the claim
// stays checkable from telemetry instead of from a screenshot -- scored as TWO counters, never one,
// because "the cover is behind the game" (invisible, cosmetic) and "the cover is in front of the
// dialog" (the defect this whole ownership chain exists to remove) are opposite failures and a
// single fused total reports neither. See `SAVE_PICKER_DIM_Z_BEHIND_GAME` for the run that proved
// that, and `z_order_violations` for the scoring.
//
// The window is `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE | WS_EX_TRANSPARENT`, so it never takes focus and never eats a
// click, and its class name starts with `ErEffects` so `game_main_window`'s finder keeps skipping
// it -- which is what keeps the OWNER of the cover, and the input-drive target, the real game
// window even though the dialog's own owner is now the cover.

/// Everything that owns the dim window lives in its own nested module: this code needs ~30
/// GDI/window imports, and keeping them nested avoids colliding with the startup-hook compatibility
/// import shim while the larger module split is underway.
