//! Resolving, writing and destroying a `CS::SceneObjProxy` over a live Scaleform display object.
//!
//! Moved out of `er-quickload`'s `quit_menu/profile_05_010_editor_runtime.rs`, which keeps the
//! ProfileSelect browse surface and now calls these through here. They are shared primitives rather
//! than a feature: three surfaces drive them (the loading-screen stats text, the ProfileSelect
//! editor and the System>Quit link field), and the third is the one that has to work with no
//! product DLL behind it.
//!
//! # The pair of proxies, which is what the crash was about
//!
//! Every resolve boxes `SCENE_OBJ_PROXY_STACK_BYTES` of scratch, hands it to the native
//! `assignComponentWithName`, and owes a `~CSScaleformValue` on the embedded value plus a `Box`
//! free afterwards. Destroying the wrong offset stamps a vtable over the component-link node, and
//! doing it on only one of a nested pair leaks a GFx handle per frame in a per-frame caller such as
//! the live clipboard mirror. [`with_text_input_02_990_field`] exists so that sequence is written
//! exactly once.
//!
//! # Why every call is guarded before it is dispatched
//!
//! A destructed component passes the obvious checks: its vtable is the abstract base's, whose slots
//! hold `_purecall` -- an address inside the game image, so "the pointer looks like game code" says
//! nothing. Calling it writes `0xdead` to a null pointer and takes the process with it. Hence
//! [`dispatch_target_is_purecall`] on the slot before every virtual dispatch.
