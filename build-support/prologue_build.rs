// Shared build-script support for GENERATING detour-prologue byte constants with `iced-x86`.
//
// This file is `include!`d by the build script of every crate that byte-checks a game function's
// prologue before detouring or calling it. It exists so that no crate has to hand-type machine
// code: the expected bytes are produced by naming the instructions and letting the assembler
// encode them.
//
// # Why hand-typed prologues are a trap
//
// `mov rax, rsp` has two legal encodings. `CodeAssembler::mov(rax, rsp)` emits `48 89 e0`; the
// game ships `48 8b c4`. A prologue that differs by one byte fails its own install-time byte
// check, the hook disarms itself on every launch, and the feature looks built while doing
// nothing. That happened in this repo. So the rule is: name the instruction, and where the
// assembler has a choice, name the exact `Code` (see [`mov_r64_rm64`] and friends below).
//
// # What pins the result
//
// Two independent checks, both applied by [`generate`]:
//
// 1. **The pin.** Every spec carries the byte sequence the constant had before it was generated.
//    It is machine-independent and always runs, so a wrong encoding choice breaks the build
//    everywhere -- including a machine with no copy of the game.
// 2. **Ground truth.** When a readable copy of the image is found, the assembled bytes are
//    compared against the bytes actually living at that VA in the real binary. This is the
//    stronger check, but it can only run where the image exists, so it SKIPS (with a
//    `cargo:warning` naming what went unverified) rather than failing when it is absent -- the
//    same shape as the corpus-gated tests in `crates/er-gfx/tests/common/mod.rs`.
//
// The pin is therefore not redundant with ground truth: it is the half that survives on a
// machine, or in CI, that has no game files.
//
// # ONE supported version per module, recorded here, checked before anything else
//
// Every image named below is pinned to exactly ONE build, and this workspace supports that build
// and no other. There is no candidate list, no "try these addresses and see which one takes", and
// no best-effort adaptation to whatever the machine happens to hold. The only question asked of an
// installed module is the boolean one: *is this the build we recorded, yes or no*.
//
// The two halves of an image's identity, and why they are not the same question:
//
// * **Which build is this file?** A game image answers by its NAME: `eldenring-deobf.bin` *is*
//   1.16.2 and `eldenring-deobf-1.17.bin` *is* 1.17, because this workspace produces them and
//   names them. `ersc.dll` cannot answer that way -- it is third-party, it always has the same
//   file name, and the user replaces it on their own schedule -- so it answers by CONTENT: the
//   `Seamless Co-op vX.Y.Z by Yui` banner Seamless builds into its own image.
//   [`ERSC_SUPPORTED_VERSION`] is the recorded answer, and it is the single value to change when
//   this workspace moves to a new Seamless build.
// * **Are our bytes right for it?** That is ground truth, and it may only be asked once the first
//   question has been answered YES. Comparing a pin against a DIFFERENT build's file is not ground
//   truth failing, it is ground truth being impossible: the diff it prints is a fact about a
//   module nobody claimed those addresses described.
//
// So [`generate`] identifies before it compares, and BOTH answers are fatal when they are wrong:
//
// * **Wrong version installed.** The machine has Seamless, and it is not the build this tree was
//   measured against. A DLL built here would be inert on that machine at best -- the runtime gates
//   fail closed -- and its addresses name the wrong fields of a live multiplayer session at worst.
//   The build says so, in full, naming both versions and the ways out. It does not warn and carry
//   on: a `cargo:warning` scrolls past inside a green build, and the person who then pays for it
//   is a player wondering why a feature does nothing.
// * **Right version, wrong bytes.** The file IS the recorded build and our constants disagree with
//   it. That is a defect in this repo -- the pins are wrong for the version they claim -- and it
//   panics for every image alike, `ersc.dll` included.
//
// **A module that is absent is not a mismatch.** No `ersc.dll`, no game image, no `ER_ERSC_DLL`:
// nothing to disagree with, so ground truth SKIPS with a `cargo:warning` and the pin carries the
// verification alone. That is what keeps this buildable in CI and on a machine that has never
// installed Seamless, and it is the same line `scripts/check-game-version-supported.py` draws --
// "a missing game is not a failed gate, it is a machine without the game."
//
// # The escape hatch, and the gate that it cannot slip past
//
// `ER_ERSC_DLL` names the file to ground-truth against, so a developer whose install has moved on
// can still build by pointing it at a copy of the supported build. It is deliberately narrow: it
// changes which file the CONSTANTS are checked against, and it is itself version-checked, so it
// cannot be used to wave a mismatch through. It also says nothing about what the machine will
// actually load -- that question belongs to `scripts/check-ersc-version-supported.py`, which reads
// the INSTALLED module and is not overridable by this variable.
//
// When the pinned VA does not hold, [`generate`] searches the module's real code sections for the
// assembled bytes under the generated mask, so the diagnostic carries the address the function
// moved TO rather than only the fact that it moved. That search is deliberately NOT wired back
// into the constants: a build-machine-discovered RVA would bake one particular installed DLL into
// a DLL shipped to other machines. Locating at runtime is the consumer's job, and where it cannot
// be done safely the consumer fails closed -- see the module docs of
// `crates/er-invasion-warp/src/local_invasion_filter.rs`.
