# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. **Invoke the real binary directly at `$HOME/.local/bin/bd`** -- do NOT use the bare `bd` command. The bare `bd` is a shell guard *function* (from the interactive shell snapshot) that errors with `bd guard error: unable to locate real bd binary` unless `BD_REAL_BIN` is exported, and non-interactive/agent shells do not get that function or env var. The local-bin path is the same ELF binary the guard would exec, so calling it directly works across current-user home directories. Run `$HOME/.local/bin/bd prime` for the bounded workflow context (memory search index + newest memories + ready queue); the project rules themselves live in this file.

## Offline Game-Asset Investigation Boundary

When the user explicitly says to continue until a game run is required, do not stop at a plan-only checkpoint. Continue all available non-runtime work first: unpack/localize assets, inspect binders, run static/Ghidra/tooling probes, validate exports/imports offline, and update Beads as evidence accumulates. Treat archive extraction/unpacking of installed game files as offline asset work, not as a game run; do it before claiming the next step requires running a game. Report back only when the next material step truly requires launching/running a game, needs subjective user choice, or hits a concrete capability blocker.

## Runtime Failure Attribution Before Retest

When a user-visible asset/runtime test shows no change, do not answer with a "most likely" cause or ask for another blind run. First determine exactly what was wrong from offline evidence whenever possible: verify the profile/package paths, map the in-game mechanism to the exact regulation rows/part IDs/asset filenames, and only then build the next package or ask for a runtime retest. If a previous run was not instrumented or configured to capture enough evidence, treat that as a validation failure and fix the evidence path before retrying.

## User-Visible Launch Follow-Up Gate

After launching Elden Ring, Blender, or any other user-visible app for the user's live inspection, do not immediately pivot into unrelated edits, checks, or background work. First perform and report a bounded post-launch state check: launched profile/artifact path, launcher/process state, matched top-level window when applicable, latest relevant launcher/log evidence, and crash/modal/error-window scan when the tool can provide it. If the launch remains open for the user, explicitly record it as a tracked live resource with PID/title/profile path and then stop mutating until the user's next observation or an agreed monitor/teardown step. A process/window appearing is not enough by itself to claim the launch is safe or review-ready.

## Asset Deformation Feedback Before More Slider Tuning

When user feedback shows that offline slider changes are not producing the intended deformation, stop continuing blind slider iterations. Establish a direct authoring/feedback surface first: load the ER donor/player body and the imported source model together in a 3D tool, compare literal model bounds/proportions, inspect weights/bone ownership, and make the next edit from that evidence. Prefer Blender plus a Souls/FLVER-capable importer/exporter or another direct FLVER authoring tool over more runtime-only guesswork. Do not propose skeleton or weapon-socket edits as the next step until the model-scale/fit comparison has been made or proven unavailable.

When the issue becomes visual/material-specific (for example texture placement, UVs, seams, normals, or lighting), do not continue blind exporter changes from verbal descriptions alone. Ask for a focused, non-desktop visual artifact/crop as the fastest evidence path, while respecting screenshot sensitivity: request the smallest crop that shows the defect and avoid full-desktop capture unless the user explicitly permits it.

For task startup in this repo, read relevant `bd` memories (`$HOME/.local/bin/bd memories <topic>` and `$HOME/.local/bin/bd recall <key>`) before broad source inspection or implementation. Treat memories as the first-pass continuation context; do not discover them midstream after choosing an approach.

## Elden Ring Runtime Probe Hygiene

**Do NOT `frida.attach()` the running Elden Ring. It KILLS the game.** On this Wine/Proton target the
attach injects a bootstrapper that segfaults *inside* `eldenring.exe` -- it reports `frida.NotSupportedError:
bootstrapper crashed with signal 11` and the process dies instantly (the DLL debug log stops mid-line with no
shutdown sequence; only `wineserver`/`winedevice.exe` survive). Measured 2026-08-12, destroying a live session
that was being held open for inspection. For a **read-only** question about live memory ("what is this pointer
now", "which field is the caret") use `scripts/er-live-fields.py`, which reads `/proc/<pid>/mem` -- no injection,
no thread suspension, nothing runs in the target. To learn **which code writes** a field, use the
`linux-x86-debug` toolkit's `tracebreakpoint` (winedbg --gdb attach) described below, never Frida. See bd
`frida-attach-kills-wine-eldenring-use-proc-mem-2026-08-12`.

When using Frida (only where it is already proven to work) or the injected DLL to scrape runtime Elden Ring
data, keep the session explicitly in runtime-probing mode while the game remains live. If more live probing is needed, state that explicitly instead of silently pivoting to unrelated work.

When a runtime probe is explicitly meant to stay live for manual interaction / `read` follow-up, do **not** use a watcher path that owns process shutdown (`.auto/runtime_probe.sh`, `er-readiness-watch.py`, or helpers that wait on them) unless the user explicitly asks for an agent-owned bounded run. A user-inspection probe must be genuinely live: launch the approved offline/direct `eldenring.exe` path and leave it running for the user.

For user-inspection runs, do **not** enable autopilot/repro drivers, fabricated input, or input-blocking modes unless the user explicitly asks for self-driving. If a probe must drive menus automatically, treat it as an agent-owned runtime experiment with bounded telemetry and do not claim the user is in control. Before saying the user can take over, verify via telemetry that the input block/repro driver has released and that the game process is still alive.

Standing user order (2026-07-17): do not stop or yield merely because the proper next runtime step will launch Elden Ring on the current desktop or may capture input. When launching Elden Ring or capturing input is appropriate for the current objective and uses an approved launch/probe path, proceed instead of asking for generic permission. Tell the user immediately before the launch/input-capture step exactly what will happen and why, then run it. Do **not** emit reminders or reassurance that no launch/input capture is happening; if the current step is non-launching, just do the non-launching work without a no-launch disclaimer. Still respect the forbidden Steam/EAC launch forms, save-safety rules, visual-oracle restrictions, and any truly destructive/irreversible boundary.

Standing user order (2026-07-04): whenever a new DLL build is ready for runtime validation, do not try to validate a newly built DLL in an already-running process.

If a live user-inspection Elden Ring run becomes invalid because the agent finds structured evidence that a required DLL/runtime patch did not apply, the wrong build is loaded, or the test state cannot answer the user's current visual question, stop the agent-launched run before continuing implementation. Do not let the user keep inspecting a known-invalid run while the agent quietly fixes the cause in the background. Do not announce the stop and then pause before acting; complete the stop/teardown action first, then tell the user what was stopped and why.

Do not launch Elden Ring through Steam from agent workflows. Forbidden launch forms include `steam -applaunch 1245620`, `steam://run/1245620`, `steam://rungameid/1245620`, and `xdg-open` or similar wrappers around those URLs. Do not launch `start_protected_game.exe` directly or through Proton/Wine/Steam; that is the protected/EAC launcher, not an approved agent runtime target. Process detection of stale `start_protected_game.exe` is allowed, but launching it is not. Runtime work must use only an approved, explicitly gated direct/offline `eldenring.exe` probe path.

Do not bundle `ersc.dll`. Seamless Co-op is a compatibility target, but this repo must not copy, move, archive, release-package, or stage `SeamlessCoop/ersc.dll` into me3/product release artifacts or repo `target/` bundles. For er-net-effects ME3 profiles, still include a `[[natives]]` entry that references the game-installed Seamless Co-op DLL under the Elden Ring install's `Game/SeamlessCoop/ersc.dll`; this is a runtime profile reference, not bundling or staging the DLL. **Resolve that install path, do not copy one from these notes.** This machine now runs a NATIVE LINUX Steam install -- `$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/ELDEN RING/Game/` -- which is what every `.me3` profile in `~/Elden/` actually references, and `$HOME/Elden/launch.sh` derives from `ME3_STEAM_DIR`. The `C:\SteamLibrary\...` path this line used to name belongs to the retired WSL2 setup: there is no `/mnt/c` here (the Windows partitions mount as `/mnt/win-c`, `/mnt/win-d`), so every such path silently resolves to nothing and a `find` over it returns empty rather than erroring -- which reads as "the file is missing" instead of "you looked in the wrong place".

**ONE supported Seamless Co-op build, recorded in one place (user directive 2026-09-03).** This
repo does not support multiple Seamless versions and does not search for whichever build happens to
be installed. The supported version is `ERSC_SUPPORTED_VERSION` in
`build-support/prologue_build.rs`, and it is the ONLY place the number is written -- the runtime
refusal in `local_invasion_filter.rs` names it through the generated `ersc::SUPPORTED_VERSION`
constant rather than a second literal. Moving to a new Seamless build is a re-measurement (see
`scripts/locate-ersc-entry-points.py`; a signature match is a candidate, never an identification),
followed by editing that one line. Two checks enforce it and neither degrades quietly:
`build-support/prologue_build.rs` reads the `Seamless Co-op vX.Y.Z by Yui` banner out of the file it
is about to ground-truth against and PANICS before comparing a single byte if it is a different
build, and `scripts/check-ersc-version-supported.py` (wired into `check.sh`) does the same for the
INSTALLED module and is deliberately not overridable by `ER_ERSC_DLL`. An ABSENT module is not a
mismatch and still skips -- same line `scripts/check-game-version-supported.py` draws for the game.
`ER_ERSC_DLL` points the build at a copy of the supported build (the gitignored
`vendor-archive/seamless/ersc-<version>.dll` archive is the intended source) and is itself
version-checked, so it cannot wave a mismatch through.

**The one exception, added 2026-09-02 by user directive: a gitignored REFERENCE ARCHIVE.**
Both Seamless builds now live at `vendor-archive/seamless/` (`ersc-1.9.9.dll`,
`ersc-2.0.0.dll`), which `.gitignore` covers, so they are never committed, never named by
a `.me3` profile, never staged into `target/`, and never released. That is the same
category as `eldenring-deobf*.bin`: a read-only RE input this repo keeps untracked. The
reason it has to exist is concrete -- v2.0.0 replaced v1.9.9 on 2026-09-02 and the
launcher *happened* to leave the old build at `Game/_SeamlessCoop/`; the next launcher run
may not, and every Seamless address this repo pins was measured against a specific build,
so losing the previous one leaves the next update with nothing to diff against. Prefer the
archive over the game-install backup path. The guard enforces the carve-out with a
fail-closed shape (`ersc_reference_archive_copy_command` in
`.cupcake/policies/claude/bash_elden_ring_launch_guard.rego`): the WHOLE command must be a
single quoted `cp`, no chaining, no substitution, no redirects, source ending `/ersc.dll`,
destination `vendor-archive/seamless/ersc-<version>.dll`. A `mkdir -p ... && cp ...` is
correctly refused -- run the `mkdir` as its own command first. Every other destination
denies exactly as before.

Do not COMMIT game-derived binaries either (user directive 2026-07-02): no extracted or transformed game assets (`.gfx`, `.dcx`, `.bnd`, `.tpf`, `.sl2`, texture/font payloads) as repo files, including test fixtures. Version FINGERPRINTS (length + FNV/sha constants) and deterministic generators instead; tests that need real asset bytes read them from the local extraction corpus (env-overridable root, e.g. `ER_GFX_CORPUS_ROOT` in `crates/er-gfx/tests/common/mod.rs`) and SKIP when it is absent. Large embedded byte arrays in `.rs` sources are the same problem in different clothing -- prefer runtime derivation from the game's own in-memory data (see `er_gfx::title_05_000`) or structured edit tables over byte dumps.

User-provided or configured save files are read-only sources, including repo/local `save-files` inputs and arbitrary picked `.sl2`/`.co2` paths. Runtime/profile-switch writes must go only to the game-owned active default save copy/staged tree. The narrow exception is the live game-owned `%APPDATA%/EldenRing/<steamid>/ER0000.{sl2,co2}` path itself, which must remain writable because Elden Ring owns it and may crash or fail if it is forced read-only.

For custom title/loading cover surfaces, use a native D3D12/game-render-layer path or direct game UI/render primitive path only, with proof that the surface is above `PRESS ANY BUTTON` / `CONTINUE`.

Hyprland `grim -g` captures a screen region, not a window backing store. Runtime OCR/screenshot checks must first validate an exact Elden Ring target window (`class == steam_app_1245620`) that is mapped, not hidden, focused/topmost (`focusHistoryID == 0`), and has sane geometry. If that validation fails, fail closed without taking or trusting a screenshot; do not crop an occluded region that may contain another app.

### Loading-screen-portrait screenshot -> semaphore loop (MANDATORY diagnostic protocol)

Every title-cover/autoresearch probe must capture the **loading-screen-portrait / portrait-cover moment**. Do not delay this screenshot to make the artifact prettier: capture the exact moment where the USER can see whether the feature is failing, because that failure view is the evidence to convert into a stricter semaphore. `scripts/er-readiness-watch.py` invokes `scripts/capture-er-window.py` when the in-process portrait-cover oracle first asserts, writing `<ARTIFACT_DIR>/loading-screen-portrait-screenshot.jpg` (or `.txt` if capture fail-closes). Later screenshots have no value for this objective: world-stable state is already known-good and does not show whether the loading-screen portrait looked correct. Keep the event capture wired into runtime probes; if a new harness is added, capture the loading-screen-portrait moment, not just process exit.

Here "semaphore" means an **in-process memory-read telemetry oracle** -- a value the DLL derives by reading the game's PE/RAM (the `oracle_*` fields in `er-quickload-telemetry.json`: e.g. `oracle_msgbox_total_builds`, `oracle_player_present`, `oracle_saved_map_c30`, `oracle_server_status_any_seen`, `oracle_char_name`), NOT a `bd` memory and NOT the screenshot. RAM-read oracles remain the run-stopping/product-proof detectors. Agent-generated captures are artifacts FOR THE USER to review by default: do not read/open/visually interpret agent-generated screenshots or captured image/video frames without explicit user permission. If inspecting an agent-generated visual artifact would materially improve correctness, say why and encourage the user to authorize that specific inspection. If the user provides, pastes, attaches, or directly names an image in the prompt, read and inspect that user-provided image as supporting evidence for the current diagnostic unless the user says not to or a concrete privacy/policy boundary blocks it. Visual-acceptability judgments should still be resolved into RAM/native/pixel telemetry semaphores whenever possible.

Screenshots/visual state must **never** be used as the run-stopping oracle. Stop/continue decisions must come from RAM/in-process telemetry semaphores, structured progress, explicit failure semaphores, process exit, or the hard runtime cap. The event screenshot is a diagnostic artifact for the USER to evaluate; the agent's job is to resolve reported phenomena into stronger RAM/native/pixel telemetry. During the current title-cover/autoload autoresearch, seeing the `LOAD GAME` / profile-select screen with no finished product is an expected unfinished state because it masks the old title menu; do not classify that view itself as a blocker, success, or unexpected condition unless a RAM semaphore says the underlying state is wrong.

When the USER reports or provides a loading-screen-portrait screenshot/image that shows anything unexpected or insufficient, use the user report and/or user-provided image as supporting evidence, then resolve the described/observed phenomenon into RAM/native/pixel telemetry so the image is never the run-stopping oracle. If a memory-read semaphore should have caught it but false-negatived, fix/extend that `oracle_*` field; if it is a genuinely new visual phenomenon, add a new in-process or pixel/native surface semaphore and classify it good/bad. Never let "the image showed X" stay a one-off visual observation: every on-screen phenomenon must end up detectable from PE/RAM/native/pixel telemetry. Record the resulting RE finding in `bd` for the next agent, but the durable semaphore itself lives in DLL/watcher telemetry, not in `bd`.

**Behavioral-feature proof requires a DIRECT objective measurement of the rendered output, never indirect signals.** A rendered/visual feature (look-at tracking, pose change, camera move, deformation, overlay text placement/sharpness, loading-cover composition) is NOT proven by: build success, launch success, cleanup/teardown, no crash, hook counters (`hook_hits`), label buckets, "the draw task ran" counters, "the Present hook fired", or eyeballing one or two frames. Those prove the harness/input path fired, not that the *pixels* changed as claimed. Teardown is fine for agent-owned diagnostic probes, but the obligatory runtime evidence for a user-facing feature must be either a live/manual-inspection run or a captured feature-specific pixel/RAM/native oracle before cleanup; a bounded probe that exits cleanly with zero feature-specific oracle hits is **negative or unproven evidence**, never product proof. Say that plainly and either add the missing oracle or keep investigating. A bone write is not a rendered pixel: the per-frame profile `draw_step` is a `ClearRTV`, NOT a rasterize (and post-table-build it is skipped), so the model is **not** re-rasterized per pose unless a real model DRAW is driven -- the captured head is the engine's last genuine render, static, regardless of how many times the look-at fires. **Concrete gate for pose/look-at tracking: capture the rendered RT at the input extremes and the middle, then PIXEL-DIFF them; the opposite extremes (e.g. cursor LEFT vs RIGHT) must differ MORE than adjacent ones AND a head/face centroid must shift monotonically with the input.** If the opposite extremes are ~identical, the feature is NOT working -- declare it broken, not proven. (Failure that prompted this, 2026-06-30: cursor LEFT vs RIGHT dumps were 95% identical pixels yet "tracking" was claimed from distinct bucket labels + hook counters.) Build this diff into the proof harness as a RAM/file semaphore so no "tracking works" claim can be made without it; and never assemble a comparison contact sheet from MIXED runs (only same-run frames are apples-to-apples).

Legal/EULA/privacy popup detection must not rely on OCR as the only oracle. Prefer packed-asset/native evidence (`msg/engus/menu.msgbnd.dcx` -> `ToS_win64.fmg` text IDs, in-process dialog/state telemetry, or stronger static/runtime hooks); OCR may only be supplemental after exact target-window validation.

Every `CS::MessageBoxDialog` before or immediately after character load is a hard crash/investigation trigger. Do not keep, display, auto-accept, or treat message boxes as acceptable product behavior. The existing MessageBoxDialog OK-handler/auto-accept path is deprecated old fake-input-era behavior: it may be used only as historical/probe reference, not as product proof. The box itself has no product value; identify the native side effect/gate it would perform, decide whether that side effect is irrelevant/offline-only or required, and skip/satisfy the semantic side effect directly without UI/input. Product proof requires zero MessageBoxDialog builds.

For Elden Ring runtime validation, do not rely on slow manual/LLM-paced input timing. Prefer a deterministic fast helper/driver for inputs and captures, and use observable completion or structured failure signals for evidence. Every agent-run shell/runtime operation must also be time-bounded, but by the regime that fits it: non-game ops (scripts, Ghidra, builds, any subprocess) are hard-capped at 30s (`scripts/check-no-timeouts.py`, `MAX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) so mistakes fail fast; the GAME runtime portion is bounded by the semaphore-progress model whose idle/stall backstop is the canonical runtime-probe cap. In both cases the time bound is a safety backstop, NOT the primary synchronization mechanism -- the primary teardown signal is an in-memory RAM oracle (tear down a small delay after the last semaphore the specific test cares about). The cap is a single source of truth in `.auto/runtime_timeout_cap_seconds`. **To see the timeout cap, look here: `.auto/runtime_timeout_cap_seconds` (read it directly with `cat`, or call `scripts/runtime_timeout_cap.py`) -- do not duplicate the number elsewhere; it drifts.** That reader is the only place the value is interpreted; its fail-safe fallback (missing/unreadable file) and its absolute clamp are both pinned to the same value in `scripts/runtime_timeout_cap.py`, so the file remains the lone hard truth and no other value can leak in. The value is read through `scripts/runtime_timeout_cap.py` and the bash probes and passed through to `er-readiness-watch.py --max-runtime-seconds`. `run_experiment` timeouts may include build/setup/cleanup overhead, but runtime success is not credible after `runtime_probe_seconds` exceeds that cap and must be scored/treated as failure. Do not use sleeps as synchronization.

Do not use delayed mouse/keyboard polling as the primary way to advance menus during runtime probes. The smoke driver must default to no pointer nudges. If deterministic state injection/hooks are not enough, add/extend the safe input or save-loader workspace crates.

Standing user order (2026-07-22): there is NO single input a user can perform that the agent cannot perform itself if it actually tries. The AGENT drives every required input (menu navigation, Continue, System->Quit, tab-switch, movement, anything) -- via the input-harness direct-memory native-binding injection (`inputmgr+0x90+eventId` keystate bitmap, `DLUID+0x88d`), the movement-injection probe, or synthesized OS keyboard/mouse to the ER window. A menu/input "gap" (e.g. the OptionSetting->Quit tab-switch having no reversed menu-event id) is a mechanism to SOLVE -- reverse the id, drive the cursor/mouse to the tab, or use direct input -- NEVER a reason to ask the user to drive. Asking the user to perform an in-game input is an instruction-following failure; the vanilla-like comparison run and every runtime test are agent-driven end to end.

Autoresearch runtime probes are disabled fail-closed unless `scripts/check-runtime-probe-contract.py`, its regression tests, and `.auto/runtime_experiment_policy.rego` are deliberately changed together. The Rego runtime policy must require `timeout_seconds` to be present, greater than 0, and no more than the canonical cap in `.auto/runtime_timeout_cap_seconds` (the single source of truth; the contract checker asserts the policy literal equals it); the runtime path should still terminate from observable progress, completion, or structured failure evidence before that hard cap whenever possible. To change the cap, edit `.auto/runtime_timeout_cap_seconds`, the rego literal, and the fallback/ceiling in `scripts/runtime_timeout_cap.py` together (they are all pinned to the same single value) and re-run the contract checker/test.

For Pi `run_experiment` in this repo, the cap is the same single hard truth as everything else: `timeout_seconds` and `checks_timeout_seconds` for the GAME runtime portion must be no greater than the value in `.auto/runtime_timeout_cap_seconds` (currently 300s / 5 min; original user directive 2026-07-17). That value is NOT a wall-clock target -- it is the GAME idle/stall backstop of a **semaphore-progress teardown model**: a live run should tear down a small delay after the last in-memory RAM oracle the specific test cares about (so most runs finish far under the backstop), and the 300s only bounds a run that makes no semaphore progress. This is distinct from, and much larger than, the non-game timeout: every non-game/agent-shell op is separately hard-capped at 30s by `scripts/check-no-timeouts.py` (`MAX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`), so a mistaken/unbounded Ghidra query still fails fast in seconds, never after minutes. See bd `runtime-teardown-semaphore-progress-watchdog-2026-07-17`. Do not call `run_experiment` with a larger tool timeout. RESOLVED 2026-08-31 (this was the "drift to clean up" this paragraph used to flag): `.auto/run_experiment_policy.rego` never existed, so `scripts/check-run-experiment-contract.py` could only ever print `missing run_experiment policy` and exit 1, and nothing invoked it. The checker has been DELETED rather than revived, for two reasons. It hard-coded `MAX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 45` and required the literal `max_timeout_seconds := 45` in the policy it validated -- a second, contradictory copy of the cap, which is exactly the duplication `.auto/runtime_timeout_cap_seconds` is the single source of truth to prevent. And `run_experiment` is a Pi harness tool: no runner in this repo calls it, so the policy would have gated nothing. The live runtime policy is `.auto/runtime_experiment_policy.rego`, validated by `scripts/check-runtime-probe-contract.py --audit`, which check.sh does run and which reads the cap from the canonical file. If `run_experiment` is ever reintroduced, gate it there instead of resurrecting a parallel cap.

Standing user order (2026-07-19, LOOSENED 2026-07-20): during loading-bar runtime probes, if the loading bar stops making observable progress, treat a sufficiently long flat window as a stall semaphore and tear the run down promptly with a failed/incomplete verdict and preserved artifacts. The flat-window threshold was raised from 10s to 60s (`LOADING_PROGRESS_STALL_SECONDS` in `scripts/capture-samechar-3x.py`; boot timeout 110s->300s) because the early asset-load bootup window can legitimately crawl (bar increases, labels/numerator advance slowly) rather than truly hang, and a 10s flat window tore down on that legitimate slow progress. The real fix is to TUNE the early boot semaphores so they do not tear down too early during the asset-load bootup window (single-core-contention is a NOTHINGBURGER -- see bd `LOBOTOMIZE-single-core-contention-is-a-nothingburger-tune-early-semaphores-2026-07-22`; do NOT invoke core starvation as a cause). Distinguish a real hang (the `oracle_system_step_label` / loading substep FROZEN) from slow progress (label still advancing); tear down only on a genuinely frozen substep. The 300s cap remains a final idle/stall backstop.

Standing user order (2026-07-19): the loading-bar progress oracle and user-visible loading-bar label must use the shape `<text label> N/M (<sub milestone label> X/Y)` for every loading-screen phase. The main `N/M` is the current visible/semantic loading phase sequence. The parenthesized subprogression belongs to that active main phase and must use labels that correspond to substeps of that phase. If a phase has known granular RAM/native substeps, expose them as distinct labels in the parentheses as they are reached; if a phase has no known substep granularity, codify that ignorance with a single explicit parenthesized step for that phase (for example `<phase-specific label> 1/1`) rather than borrowing unrelated labels. Sub-milestone labels must be phase-relevant: do not show a label whose prerequisite semantics cannot apply in the current main phase (for example `PLAYER PRESENT` is not a relevant substep during boot/resource acquisition before the player can exist, and a label like `Some label 1/Y (PLAYER PRESENT 1/N)` is invalid). Do not use one generic repeated label such as `HANDOFF` or `WAIT ...` for every phase or every substep. Prefer concrete field/owner labels such as `INGAMESTEP+0xD8 REQUEST`, `MOVEMAPSTEP+0x244 DONE`, or another real RAM/native semaphore only inside phases where that field/owner is actually the current phase's loading/handoff gate. Keep the machine-readable loading-progress signature aligned with the visible main/subprogression steps, and do not treat a visible phase's nominal final frame as total completion if its phase-relevant parenthesized substeps remain.

### Autoload Identity Launch Gate

If a launch is expected to autoload, do not launch Elden Ring until the exact active character identity and slot are known from current save evidence. `ER0000.sl2` / the default APPDATA save path alone is not sufficient: record the decoded character name and slot used by the autoload. If either is unknown, stop before the launch boundary and say it is unknown. Do not substitute post-load menu automation, picker navigation, or a generic `Continue` action for this pre-launch identity check.

#### Autoload discovery before every launch

Read the game-directory `er-quickload.toml` and the newest `er-quickload-autoload-debug.log` before an expected-autoload launch. The two decisive log records are:

- `runtime-config: loaded ... save_file=... slot=...` -- the configured source/slot request;
- `save-override: DEFAULT-USER-SAVE` or an explicit staged source -- a usable autoload source was selected; `no usable autoload save ... Arming the IN-GAME missing-save picker` means **no save will autoload**.

To select another save, set `save_file` and `slot` in `er-quickload.toml`; the source stays read-only and is staged privately. `os_native_save_picker = true` chooses the OS picker surface only after a missing-save picker is triggered. There is no `require_save_picker` setting: never fake one by configuring an invalid source. The shipped README's `Save-source behavior` section and the DLL-generated config comments are the detailed reference.

Steam MUST be running before every agent-owned Elden Ring runtime proof/probe by default, but agents must not use raw `pgrep -x steam` for that check. Use the sanctioned helper path instead: source `scripts/steam-running.sh` and call `steam_running`, or run a repo script whose preflight already does that. If the helper reports Steam absent, ask the user to start Steam (interactive login) before launching that proof/probe. Reason: manual `pgrep -x steam` false-negatives on this WSL2 + Windows Steam setup, and the Cupcake/Claude `block_manual_pgrep` Rego policy that catches it is wired into Pi/Claude shell calls and will block raw pgrep. The offline `eldenring.exe` Proton launch reuses Steam's environment (wineprefix, CWD, account/save-dir id); with Steam down the game still boots but in a different environment, so the DLL debug log lands elsewhere and Steam-dependent state degrades into a non-representative run (observed 2026-06-21: a run came back `cold_char_mount_phase=5` yet appended zero debug lines and the default level-9 character). `scripts/run-product-continue-direct-probe.sh` now fails closed in `preflight()` when Steam is down. Narrow exception: when the user explicitly requests the main/user product ME3 profile launch for live inspection or log gathering and explicitly says to launch anyway / skip the Steam check in the current turn, treat that as a launch-environment override for that run only. In that case do **not** run raw `pgrep`, `scripts/steam-running.sh`, or any other Steam-process check, do not block launch on Steam absence, launch the prepared ME3 profile directly, and record in the artifact/summary that Steam preflight was intentionally skipped by user order and the resulting logs may be non-representative as product proof.

Standing runtime-validation order: after a successful build that materially increases confidence in a runtime-affecting Elden Ring change and the next proof requires live validation, launch the approved direct/offline Elden Ring probe immediately (after the applicable preflight for that run, or after recording a current-turn user override of that preflight) instead of waiting for another prompt. Still use the loud launch banner and exact artifact reporting.

Standing user order (2026-07-08): the staged-save/explicit `save_file` agent probe path is deprecated for release/autoload validation. It exercises different save-redirect internals than the user/product launcher and can softlock when `~/Elden/launch.sh` works. For release/autoload proof, use the user method (`~/Elden/launch.sh` with `/home/banon/Elden/quicksave.me3` and the real/default APPDATA save) or ask the user to run it; do not treat `ER_QUICKLOAD_SAVE_FILE`/gold-save staging probes as product proof. Only use the deprecated staged path for targeted save-redirect internals with an explicit opt-in such as `ER_QUICKLOAD_ALLOW_DEPRECATED_STAGED_SAVE_PROBE=1`.

Release/default behavior must not depend on agent-only environment variables. Any runtime-affecting feature intended for product use must work from a normal `cargo xwin build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` DLL loaded by ME3 with no hidden `RUNTIME_*`, `ER_QUICKLOAD_*`, or smoke-driver env vars. Env vars may be diagnostic overrides only; do not use env-gated behavior as product proof, and do not add behind-the-scenes env vars to make a smoke pass unless the user explicitly asked for a diagnostic mode. A release smoke that only passes with env vars is a failed product smoke.

Default runtime research mode is telemetry-only/non-fatal diagnostics. Treat deliberate fail-fast faults on semaphore mismatch as "release-mode" proof gates, not the default research/debug posture. Unless the user explicitly asks for fail-fast/release behavior, runtime probes should collect/report semaphores and leave diagnosable evidence without intentionally crashing the game. Do not confuse this workflow rule with the existing `ER_QUICKLOAD_TELEMETRY_ONLY=1` save-source exemption, which currently means no character load; if needed, add/enable a separate non-fatal semaphore mode rather than abusing no-load telemetry-only.

User steering is not evidence. When the user proposes a concrete technical hypothesis or fallback during RE/runtime work, treat it as a lead to verify, not as ground truth and not as permission to skip research. Before implementing a user-steered objective claim, inspect the current static/runtime evidence that could confirm or falsify it, state the verified delta in the work artifacts/logs, and only then choose the next code change. If the evidence contradicts part of the steering, preserve the valid intent but correct the mechanism instead of reflexively agreeing.

### Prose-to-knowledge gate

If and only if the agent's recent user-facing prose referred to an entity, identifier, plan node, claim, or term as meaningful but the agent did not have enough information to communicate what that prose meant, the agent must say plainly that it does not know what the referenced thing is **before** starting any search, lookup, or inspection to clarify it. The admission must be user-visible in the same turn and precede every relevant tool call. Do not replace it with a tentative definition, a plan built on the unknown term, or search narration. If that admission was not made first, do not perform the clarifying lookup in that turn.

## linux-x86-debug Sibling Toolkit (attach / trace / DLL inject)

`linux-x86-debug` main landed runtime DLL injection support on 2026-06-27. Use it as a sibling toolkit for Wine/Proton Elden Ring runtime inspection when an attach-based path is safer than baking a probe into the chainloader:

- Capabilities: `inject_library`, `remove_library`, and `list_modules` load/unload/list DLLs in an already-running Wine/Proton process by calling `LoadLibraryA` through the existing `winedbg --gdb` attach path. It detaches and leaves the target running; no native ptrace addon is required.
- er-quickload use case: attach to approved offline/direct `eldenring.exe`, inject `er_quickload.dll` without the me3 loader path, and use `list_modules` for live PE module bases that help telemetry/oracle work. This rides the same Wine attach mechanism already used for tracebreakpoint evidence.
- Access paths: MCP server `linux-x86-debug-attach`, or import `#library-injection` / `#pe-export-table` from the linux-x86-debug package.
- Hard safety boundary: x86-64 only. Do **not** attach to or inject into `start_protected_game.exe` / EAC launcher processes. Only use the approved offline/direct `eldenring.exe` target.
- Hang caveat: the inferior `LoadLibraryA` call runs while target threads are frozen; a blocking `DllMain` or a thread holding the loader lock can hang the attach/inject operation. Keep injected DLL attach paths bounded and non-blocking.

## Reusable Tooling / Hard-Coded Path Corrections

Persistent user directive (2026-07-17): when a tool, script, helper, or documented workflow fails because of a hard-coded local path, username, machine layout, or one-off assumption, fix the reusable tool/instruction at the point of failure before continuing the one-off task. Prefer env-overridable, current-user-aware defaults (`$HOME`, discovered repo root, explicit `*_DIR`/`*_BIN` overrides, bounded known-location fallbacks) over `/home/banon`, `/home/choza`, or other user-specific literals. Do not paper over the failure by running an ad-hoc command that only works in the current session; preserve the reusable fix with validation so future identical use cases benefit.

## Ghidra Runtime Dump: First-Pass RE Source

**For ANY Elden Ring RE lookup, consult the Ghidra runtime dump FIRST -- before our own static disasm (`scripts/disas-deobf.sh` / `er_disasm`) or any runtime probe -- whenever a Ghidra project is relevant** (resolving a function/VA to a name + signature, decompiling to readable C, getting struct/field layouts, RTTI class names, namespaces). It has real symbols/types that the raw deobf binary lacks, so it is the cheapest, most authoritative first pass; only fall back to disasm/runtime when the dump cannot answer (e.g. runtime-only values, code the dump didn't symbolize).

- **A 1.17 GHIDRA DUMP NOW EXISTS AND IS SERVED ON `localhost:8767` (2026-08-30).** This supersedes every "there is no Ghidra project for 1.17, read the flat image directly" instruction anywhere in this file, in `bd`, or in an agent brief. Bring it up with `bash scripts/ghidra/mcp-up-1170.sh` (project `$HOME/ghidra_maporch/proj1170`, program `ermaporch1170`, imported from `/home/banon/pc_eldenring_runtime.1.17.0.exe.gzf` via `scripts/ghidra/import-runtime-gzf.sh`). **1.16.2 stays up on :8765 at the same time** -- that is the point, because "where did this function go" is a two-image question. Do **not** use :8766; it is an unrelated live `DarkSoulsII.exe` daemon and taking it collides with a user session. **The 1.17 shift is ZERO**, measured: `getFunctionByAddress("14074a970")` returns a function whose entry *is* `14074a970`, the address byte-proven out of `eldenring-deobf-1.17.bin`. So dump VA == deobf VA == runtime VA on 1.17, and an address the 1.17 MCP hands you needs no translation at all. **BUT IT HAS NO NAMES**: the 1.17 dump carries zero curated symbols (`searchFunctionsByName` totalCount, 1.16.2 vs 1.17 -- Scadutree 5/0, CSFeManImp 3/0, MoveMap 23/0, FreeList 6/0, TitleTopDialog 1/0). Everything is `FUN_<addr>`. **Names, types and RTTI live only on 1.16.2 and must still be carried across by pairing** -- the 1.17 dump gives you STRUCTURE, not semantics. That structure is still the prize, because unlike `.pdata` it is not blind to leaves: `.pdata` declares nothing for 5.55 MB of `.text` across 146,715 holes, while Ghidra's analysis finds 366,673 functions in 1.17 against 367,183 in 1.16.2 -- so both call graphs are now available and pairing can use call-graph topology instead of byte signatures.
- **THE INSTALLED GAME IS 1.17 SINCE 2026-08-27; THE 1.16.2 DUMP IS STILL THE ONLY *NAMED* ONE.** Read `docs/er-1.17-migration.md` before trusting any address in this file. `eldenring.exe` is now PE FileVersion **2.7.0.0** (me3 logs `Attaching to ELDEN RING(tm) 1.17.0.0 Worldwide`), so every RVA below, every `bd` memory that carries one, and every symbol the MCP returns describes the PREVIOUS build. `er-hook` refuses to install a game-image detour on an unrecognised build rather than corrupt it, so a stale address now shows up as a `HOOK REFUSED` log line instead of a crash. A **1.17 de-Arxan'd image exists** at `eldenring-deobf-1.17.bin` (generated by `scripts/dearxan-deobfuscate.rs`, verified byte-identical to live memory at three known sites); `eldenring-deobf.bin` is still 1.16.2 on purpose, because the prologue-generating build scripts and their gates are ground-truthed against it. To carry a 1.16.2 address forward, use `scripts/map-rvas-1162-to-1170.py` (masks displacements and immediates, so it survives the struct-offset drift that defeats `dump-deobf-shift.py`) and then READ the 1.17 function before hooking it.
- **THE NAMED DUMP IS 1.16.2, AND ITS `.gzf` NO LONGER EXISTS ON THIS MACHINE.** The named dump MUST be 1.16.2, NOT 1.16.1 (a 1.16.1 dump gives drifted addresses that crash-hook -- see bd `armament-icons-cachemiss-hooks-crash-1162-address-drift`). It survives ONLY as the already-imported project `ermaporch1162` @ `$HOME/ghidra_maporch/proj1162`, served on :8765. **Do not go looking for `pc_eldenring_runtime.1.16.2.exe.gzf`** -- this line used to name it at `/mnt/c/Users/choza/...`, a WSL2 path that does not exist here: there is no `/mnt/c` at all, and `/mnt/win-c` is an empty unmounted point, so a search there returns nothing and reads as "the dump is missing" rather than "you looked on a machine that is gone". Verified 2026-08-31: the only `.gzf` files under `$HOME` are `pc_eldenring_runtime.1.16.1.exe.gzf` (1.5 GB, in `projects/reverse/ghidra-projects/`) and `pc_eldenring_runtime.1.17.0.exe.gzf` (4.1 GB). Losing `proj1162` loses the only named ELDEN RING image this workspace has; it cannot be re-imported from anything local. It **requires Ghidra 12.1.2** (x86 language V4.7+ -- 12.1 fails, bd `1162-gzf-needs-ghidra-1212-not-121-2026-07-20`). The 12.1.2 install lives at `$HOME/tools/ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC`; the previously-documented `/mnt/d/ghidra/ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC` **no longer exists** (`/mnt/d` is unmounted), so set `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` or rely on `scripts/ghidra/mcp-up-1162.sh`, which resolves env-first then falls back through `$HOME/tools` -> `/mnt/d` -> `/opt`.
- **The MCP daemon on `localhost:8765` serves 1.16.2.** Bring it up / validate with `bash scripts/ghidra/mcp-up-1162.sh` (pins 12.1.2 + `ermaporch1162`). Query lock-free with `python3 scripts/ghidra/mcp_query.py <method>` -- daemon methods are **camelCase**: `getContext`, `getDecompiledCode`, `decompileFunctionByName`, `disassembleFunction`, `getFunctionByAddress`, `getXrefsTo/From`, `searchFunctionsByName`, `getStructure`, ... (NOT snake_case `get_program_info`). The Pi `ghidra` MCP bridge forwards to :8765, so its tools also serve 1.16.2. To switch the daemon: `scripts/ghidra/mcp-ghidra-daemon.sh stop` (frees :8765) then `mcp-up-1162.sh`.
- **SUPERSEDED FOR 1.16.2 (2026-07-28) -- THE SHIFT IS ZERO; DO NOT RUN `dump-deobf-shift.py`.** For the 1.16.2 dump now served by the MCP, the dump VA, the `eldenring-deobf.bin` VA, and the **live runtime** VA are all **identical** (image base `0x140000000`, shift `0`). Byte-verified independently on 30+ functions spanning `0x14025xxxx`-`0x14266xxxx`, plus a live capture: a runtime stack walk out of the game's save-write path resolved all 8 frames through the 1.16.2 MCP `getFunctionByAddress` onto clean functions (`TryWrite`, `WriteBytes`, `ThreadFunction(DLThread*)`, ...) with no adjustment. Practical consequences, in order of how badly each bites:
  1. **`scripts/dump-deobf-shift.py` is now actively WRONG and will crash-hook you.** Its DUMP side (`dump-exec.bin`) is still the 1.16.1 image, so it maps 1.16.1-dump -> 1.16.2-deobf and invents a nonzero shift where none exists. Measured failures: it reported `0x142413860 -> 0x142413870` (+0x10) and flagged `0x142410830` as a "+0x10 estimate"; **both land mid-instruction**. Trust a byte check, never this tool. `dump-exec.bin` **cannot be regenerated** -- the 1.16.2 `.gzf` it would come from does not exist on this machine (see the named-dump bullet above), so the fix is deletion, not repair. Tracked in bd `er-effects-rs-q9jd`.
  2. **An address observed at RUNTIME needs no translation at all.** A stack-capture return address, a hook callback's caller, a pointer read out of live memory -- feed it straight to the 1.16.2 MCP (`getFunctionByAddress` / `getDecompiledCode`). Putting it through the shift tooling corrupts a correct address.
  3. The piecewise `-0x20`/`-0xf0`/`+0x10` staircase described below was real, but it was an artifact of the **old 1.16.1 dump vs the 1.16.2 deobf**. Concrete confirmation: bd `fe-autosave-icon-boot-overlay-mechanism-2026-07-08` records `CSFeManImp::Update` as 1.16.1-dump `0x140771cc0` -> deobf `0x140771bd0` (shift `-0xf0`); in the **1.16.2** dump that function's entry simply *is* `0x140771bd0`.
  4. Still byte-check anything you will CALL or PATCH -- `scripts/find-deobf-bytes.py '<hex, ?? wildcards>'` prints matching VAs in one command. It defaults to `eldenring-deobf.bin`, which is **1.16.2 and not the installed game**; point it at the build you will actually run against with `ER_DEOBF_BIN=eldenring-deobf-1.17.bin`. The check is cheap and confirms shift-0 rather than discovering a shift. (The script takes bare patterns only -- `--help` raises a `ValueError` rather than printing usage.) To prove a specific dump VA is the same code as that VA in the flat image, there is an executable check rather than an argument: `python3 scripts/check-dump-deobf-identity.py 0x<va>` compares the daemon's disassembly against the image's, folding aliased spellings; `--selftest` passes as of 2026-08-31. It defaults to :8765 + `eldenring-deobf.bin`, so pass `--port 8767 --image eldenring-deobf-1.17.bin` for the installed build.
  - **`.rdata` IS shift-0 too (corrected 2026-08-01).** The previous note here claimed string literals sat at deobf = dump `+0xE00`. That is wrong, and it is falsified by its own cited example: `u"%s/EldenRing/%s/"` occurs exactly once in `eldenring-deobf.bin`, at file offset `0x2bda858` -> VA `0x142bda858`, which is the address the old note called the DUMP address. Reading its claimed deobf address `0x142bdb658` yields pointers, not the string. Independently confirmed on four more literals, each landing exactly at `offset == RVA`: `0x2a8f9e8` `"Loop"`, `0x2a8fa00` `"Grayout"`, `0x2a90508` `"FadeOut"`, `0x2b264f0` `"TextFadeOut"`. The `+0xE00` was manufactured by applying a PE section raw-pointer mapping to a file that does not need one -- `eldenring-deobf.bin` is a FLAT image, so **file offset == RVA for every section**, and `VA = 0x140000000 + file_offset` everywhere. Anyone who followed the old note when resolving a string or vtable operand read `0xE00` bytes off target, which is hook-adjacent rather than cosmetic.
- **DELETED 2026-08-31: the piecewise-shift narrative and its tool.** Two bullets used to sit here. One described the dump/deobf shift as a piecewise `-0x20`/`-0xf0`/`+0x10` staircase; the other told you to ground-truth every CALL/PATCH address with `scripts/dump-deobf-shift.py`. Both were TRUE against the **1.16.1** dump and became traps the moment the MCP started serving 1.16.2: the shift is now ZERO (see the bullet above), and the tool still reads the 1.16.1 `dump-exec.bin`, so it manufactures a nonzero shift out of a zero one. They are deleted rather than annotated because a correction sitting under a still-present instruction gets read as ambiguity, and the wrong half is the one that costs a boot. The single useful residue is already item 4 above: byte-check anything you will CALL or PATCH against the image you will run against.
- The standalone `.gzf` is separate from the shared `From Software.rep` project, which is often open in the user's Ghidra GUI (locked). NEVER open `.rep` headless; import the `.gzf` into a throwaway temp project instead. This is also why the dump is "user-approved single program," not the forbidden whole-repo scan.
- **`$HOME/ghidra_maporch/proj` IS THE 1.16.1 PROGRAM. NEVER TAKE AN ADDRESS FROM IT.** Verified 2026-08-31 by reading the project index files: `proj/ermaporch.rep` holds `pc_eldenring_runtime.1.16.1.exe`, `proj1162/ermaporch1162.rep` holds `1.16.2`, `proj1170/ermaporch1170.rep` holds `1.17.0`. This bullet used to open "PERSISTENT PROJECT (use this; no re-import)" and present `proj`/`ermaporch` as THE default project, which is how a 1.16.1 address gets taken for a current one -- exactly the failure in bd `armament-icons-cachemiss-hooks-crash-1162-address-drift`. **Default to the MCP daemons: :8765 for names/types (1.16.2), :8767 for structure (1.17).** The headless wrapper `scripts/ghidra-query.sh <postScript>.java [args...]` is kept only for Java postScripts the MCP cannot express -- it runs `analyzeHeadless <project> <program> -process -noanalysis -readOnly -postScript ...` and reopens a saved program in **~5s** (vs the ~2-min import). It still DEFAULTS to `proj`/`ermaporch`, i.e. 1.16.1, so **always name the project**: `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/tools/ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC GHIDRA_PROJ_DIR=$HOME/ghidra_maporch/proj1162 GHIDRA_PROJ_NAME=ermaporch1162` (or `proj1170`/`ermaporch1170`). Use a **Java** GhidraScript (12.1 dropped Jython; Python needs PyGhidra), and batch all lookups for one question into one script. A single known program per query, never a whole-repo scan.
- **If EVERY decompile returns "Decompilation failed" but disasm/xrefs/symbols still work**, the cause is the install's native `decompile` helper losing its executable bit (a re-copied Ghidra tree restores `+x` on the shell scripts but not on `Ghidra/Features/Decompiler/os/linux_x86_64/decompile`). `DecompInterface` spawns it per request, so the exec failure fails every decompile uniformly while pure-Java queries are unaffected, and the GhidraMCP extension swallows the real cause so nothing appears in `daemon.log`. `scripts/ghidra/mcp-ghidra-daemon.sh start` now re-applies `+x` across `*/os/linux_x86_64/` on every start (live-effective, no restart needed). Ignore the recurring `MissingBuiltInDataType.<init>()` log error -- it is cosmetic and decompilation works with it present.
  - If `scripts/ghidra-query.sh` or headless Ghidra reports the persistent project is locked, **do not fall back to offline scans/disassembly just because of the lock**. Use the Ghidra MCP tools against the already-open project first (`ghidra_decompile_function_by_address`, xrefs, disassembly, etc.). If the MCP is unavailable or stale, fix/reconnect the MCP bridge as the next step; only use offline disassembly as a fallback after the MCP path is proven unavailable for the specific query.
  - The earlier "a `BadDataType` JPMS save error prevents persisting" claim was **WRONG**: the real blocker was `/tmp` (a near-full 32G tmpfs) running out of space while unpacking the gzf. Fix (baked into the wrapper): force `java.io.tmpdir` onto a current-user writable directory such as `$HOME/ghidra_maporch/tmp` via `GHIDRA_JAVA_OPTIONS`; plain `TMPDIR` is ignored for `java.io.tmpdir`. The `BadDataType`/`IllegalAccessException` log line still prints on JDK 26 but is **cosmetic/non-fatal** (Save + Import both succeed). See bd `ghidra-persistent-project-reuse-2026-06-22`.
  - To re-import from scratch (rarely needed, e.g. a new dump version): use the current user's `ghidra_maporch/scripts/import_persistent.sh` if present, or set explicit paths rather than hard-coding `/home/banon`.
  - **Where to put GhidraScripts: `scripts/ghidra/` (version-controlled), NOT `/tmp/ghidra_scripts/`.** Reusable Java postScripts (and their helper shell wrappers) belong in the repo's `scripts/ghidra/` directory so they survive reboots, are reviewable, and are shared across agents/sessions. `ghidra-query.sh` copies the requested repo script into the current user's stable Ghidra script cache (`$HOME/ghidra_maporch/gscripts` by default, override `GHIDRA_SCRIPT_CACHE`) before execution, so a script in `scripts/ghidra/` runs as: `bash scripts/ghidra-query.sh scripts/ghidra/MyQuery.java [args...]`. Do NOT scatter new query scripts into `/tmp/ghidra_scripts/` -- that path is volatile (lost on reboot) and unversioned; older helpers still living there should be migrated into `scripts/ghidra/` when touched.
- Still respect the bounded-query hygiene below (single known program, no multi-program/whole-repo enumeration).

## Ghidra Shared Project Hygiene

Do not run broad headless Ghidra enumeration that opens every candidate program in the shared repository. A prior `ListEldenRingPrograms.java` attempt over the shared `From Software` repo had to be interrupted after nearly two hours. Use exact known project paths, repository file listings that do not open programs, or a small user-approved target list. If a new shared Ghidra query might open multiple large programs or scan the whole repository, stop and propose the bounded query first.

Do not use whole-file MD5 as the Ghidra identity oracle for Elden Ring. The shared program is expected to be a runtime dump and local `eldenring.exe` may be intentionally PE-header patched, so whole-file hashes are at best provenance metadata. Use small bounded anchor byte windows, function-boundary evidence, and section/window fingerprints at exact RVAs instead.

## Colored Elden Ring Disassembly

For Elden Ring disassembly in Pi, prefer the project Pi tool `er_disasm` instead of shelling out to `scripts/disas-*.sh` when colored/reviewable output is useful.

Examples:
- `er_disasm kind=deobf va=0x140739e20 nbytes=0x40`
- `er_disasm kind=va va=0x140792460 nbytes=0x100`
- `er_disasm kind=data va=0x143d00000 nbytes=0xb0`

Use `scripts/disas-deobf.sh --color=always ...` only for direct terminal/Kitty use.

### In-Process Decoding (`iced-x86`)

The `er_disasm` tool and `disas-*.sh` scripts (objdump-backed) are for **offline,
agent-facing** disassembly. For **in-process, runtime** x86-64 decoding *inside the
DLL* (instruction-length stepping for the INT3 single-step engine, function-prologue
validation, byte-pattern confirmation), use the **`iced-x86`** crate -- it is now a
direct dependency of the root `er-quickload` crate (pure-Rust, decoder-only feature
set, zero cross-compile overhead under cargo-xwin; it was already present
transitively via `ilhook`). Do **not** hard-code instruction byte lengths or
prologue byte sequences in new code when `iced-x86` can decode them, and do **not**
add a second disassembler (e.g. capstone/zydis) **into the DLL / in-process Rust** --
`iced-x86` already covers in-process needs and avoids a C cross-compile burden.

#### Offline Python decoding (`capstone`)

The above `iced-x86`-only rule is about **in-process Rust**. For **offline,
agent-facing Python tooling** (the `scripts/*.py` helpers), `capstone` is the
sanctioned x86-64 decoder and is **kept available on purpose** -- it exposes
per-instruction operand byte offsets (`insn.encoding.disp_offset/disp_size`,
`imm_offset/imm_size`) that make relocation-aware byte matching trivial. The worked
example used to be `scripts/dump-deobf-shift.py`; it is **banned** (see the Ghidra
section), so read `scripts/map-rvas-1162-to-1170.py` instead -- same masking idea,
pointed at the two images that are actually current. There is no system `pip`; do
**not** try to install it globally. Run capstone-using scripts under uv, which
provisions it ephemerally (cached, ~ms):
`uv run --with capstone python3 scripts/<tool>.py ...`.

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging on confirmation prompts.

Shell commands like `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` may be aliased to include `-i` (interactive) mode on some systems, causing the agent to hang indefinitely waiting for y/n input.

**Use these forms instead:**
```bash
# Force overwrite without prompting
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file

# For recursive operations
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

**Other commands that may prompt:**
- `scp` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` for non-interactive
- `ssh` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` to fail instead of prompting
- `apt-get` - use `-y` flag
- `brew` - use `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` env var

### Rules

- Use `$HOME/.local/bin/bd` for ALL task tracking -- do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `$HOME/.local/bin/bd prime` for the memory search index, the newest memories, and the top of the ready queue. It does NOT carry a command reference or the session-close protocol -- those are in this file (`## Quick Reference`, `## Session Completion`), and bd's own non-memory output is a 367-byte header (measured). `bd prime` is bounded to ~4 KB by `scripts/beads-prime.sh` + `scripts/gen-beads-prime.py`, because the unbounded form is 4.6 MB and even a titles-only index was 157 KB -- past what the harness inlines, so it got persisted to a file and never read. The full title list is written beside it at `.beads/PRIME-memory-index.txt`; `scripts/test-beads-prime-size.py` keeps the output small.
- Use `$HOME/.local/bin/bd remember` for persistent knowledge -- do NOT use MEMORY.md files (and to READ a memory use `$HOME/.local/bin/bd recall <key>`, NOT `bd remember <key>` which clobbers it)

## RTK / Code Search Caveat

**Do NOT rely on `rtk` (the workspace RTK inspection wrapper) for code or identifier searches -- it produces false negatives and mangled output.** `rtk grep` REDACTS/aliases certain identifier tokens in BOTH its output AND its matching, so a search for a token that is actually present returns zero matches or garbled text. Confirmed redacted/aliased tokens include `online`, `continue`, `splash`, `experiments` (shown as `n`/`ln`), `input`, `block`, and `GOLD_SAVE` (shown as `n`) -- among others. Concretely, `rtk grep -n "fn apply_online_disable"` returns no matches even though the function exists, and `rtk grep "ONLINE_DISABLE_RVA"` exits 1 on a symbol that is present. `rtk find` / `rtk ls` are likewise flaky (empty output for valid queries). Treat any rtk-grep zero-result as untrustworthy, never as proof of absence.

**Prefer the harness `Read` tool and `python3 -c` regex one-liners for content/identifier searches** -- python reads the REAL file bytes and is unaffected by rtk redaction. Example:

```bash
python3 -c "import re,glob; [print(f'{f}:{i}:',l.rstrip()) for f in glob.glob('src/**/*.rs',recursive=True) for i,l in enumerate(open(f,encoding='utf-8',errors='replace'),1) if re.search(r'PATTERN',l)]"
```

Note the cupcake/OPA PreToolUse guard still INTERCEPTS raw `grep`/`ls`/`find`/`cat` bash commands and forces them through `rtk` (denying them otherwise), so you cannot just run bare `grep`. Use the `Read` tool and `python3` (neither is intercepted by the guard) instead of bash `grep`/`rtk grep` for inspection.

## Local Hidden Worktrees

- `/.worktrees/` is intentionally gitignored and may contain local git worktrees/sandboxes (for example `.worktrees/bevy-shader-tinkering`, a Bevy WGSL shader lab). Do not treat these directories as repo dirt, and do not delete/reconcile them unless the user explicitly asks.
- Work inside a `.worktrees/<name>` checkout only when that checkout is the intended active repo/branch. Do not merge sandbox contents into `main` just because they live under the repo root; persist shared policy in tracked root files instead.
- The Bevy shader lab is local tinkering by default. Productizing it into the main workspace requires an explicit user request and normal review of the `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock` impact.

## Pre-Existing Issues Are Yours To Fix (user directive 2026-07-17)

Every pre-existing issue you encounter -- a red gate, a lint violation, a broken check, a tracked
file that already fails, latent tech debt -- is to be treated as **solely generated by you and
pre-authorized by the user**. Do NOT disclaim it ("not mine", "pre-existing", "out of scope",
"someone else committed this") and move on. You own it.

Handling rule:
- **Default: parallel background subagent.** If the issue does NOT interfere with your current task,
  dispatch a background subagent to fix it (make the gate green, remove the violation) while you keep
  working on your original objective. It is a real deliverable, not a footnote -- see it through to a
  clean state and a commit, same as any other work.
- **Blocker: do it first.** If the issue interferes with or blocks your current task (a gate you must
  pass to commit/validate, a broken dependency you need, a failure that makes your own proof
  untrustworthy), it is a blocker: fix it BEFORE the original task, not in parallel.
- **Blocker + major digression that touches this code: isolate it in a worktree.** When the fix is
  both a real blocker AND a substantial change to shared source (not a small localized fix), run the
  subagent in its OWN git worktree under an agreed untracked dir -- `.worktrees/<name>` (gitignored;
  see Local Hidden Worktrees) or under `./target` -- via the Agent tool's `isolation: "worktree"` or
  an explicit `git worktree add`. That keeps its edits/commits out of your main working tree so they
  cannot collide with your in-flight work; bring the result back only once it is green. A small,
  localized, non-conflicting fix does NOT need a worktree -- a plain background subagent in the main
  tree is fine (it must avoid the exact files you are editing).

The pre-authorization is standing, so you do not need to ask before fixing a pre-existing issue; just
fix it (in parallel, first, or worktree-isolated per the rules above) and report it alongside your
main work.

## Commit Timing (user directive 2026-07-17, REVISED 2026-07-21)

Commit **after a runtime validation run COMPLETES, and only if the changes are worth keeping** -- i.e.
the completed run showed the change is good/useful, or the tree state is genuinely worth preserving as
evidence. Do **NOT** commit before or during a run (do not commit a fix just because a run was launched),
and do **NOT** commit changes a completed run showed are not worth keeping (revert or fix them instead).
Otherwise do NOT commit and do NOT ask about committing -- keep working; a completed, worth-keeping run
is the commit trigger. (Superseded the old "commit immediately after launching, pass or fail" behavior,
which committed premature/unvalidated fixes.)

Same discipline for **`bd remember`**: record a memory **after** a step, and **only if the finding is
worth keeping** (validated, durable, non-obvious) -- not eagerly for every intermediate hypothesis or
run. See bd commit-immediately-after-runtime-validation-2026-07-17 (revised).

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until the agent-owned branch is pushed. Do **not** push directly to `main`.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH THE WORK BRANCH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY, but direct pushes to `main` are forbidden:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase origin main
   "$HOME/.local/bin/bd" dolt push
   git push -u origin <feature-or-tooling-branch>
   git status  # MUST show the branch is clean and tracking its remote
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND the work branch pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session / review path

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until the work branch is pushed
- NEVER push directly to `main` from an agent session
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - push the work branch yourself
- If branch push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
<!-- END BEADS INTEGRATION -->

## Runtime-Affecting Refactor Feasibility

When the user asks whether a runtime-affecting refactor is possible/easy/safe, investigate first before answering. Do not guess from source shape alone. Minimum feasibility check: inspect the runtime entrypoints, loader/export expectations, staging scripts, existing probes, and the current known-working runtime proof path; identify what could break and what smoke would prove non-regression. Do not call the refactor non-breaking until a live runtime smoke passes. Never commit or push a runtime-affecting refactor to `main` before the required smoke proof exists.

## No Compromises

We accept **no compromises** on the stated objective: a same-character repeat load
(System->Quit->**Load Character**) that reaches **genuine world readiness** (character rendered
AND the player can move).

**THE BUTTON NAMES, AND THE OLD ONES THIS REPO IS STILL FULL OF.** Both load rows on the
Quit Game tab are OURS -- vanilla ships only *Save Game* and *Return to Desktop*, and the
mod clones the row twice. They were renamed on 2026-07-31 after a review found the original
pair indistinguishable, but the old words survive in prose, in `bd` memories and in the
constant names, so read them as synonyms rather than as a second feature:

| old name (still in memories/symbols) | ON SCREEN since 2026-07-31 | takes as input |
|---|---|---|
| Load Profile | **Load Character** | a character from the save container already loaded |
| Load Save Profiles | **Load Character from File** | a save file off the disk |

A THIRD cloned row, **Load Build from URL**, was added later and has never had another name.
It is the odd one out on the tab: it neither returns to the title nor touches a save container,
but rebuilds the character you are already playing from the `build_url` set in the game-directory
`er-quickload.toml` (items granted, gear worn, spells memorised, level and attributes matched). The
importer behind it is `er-build-import-runtime`, shared with the standalone `er-build-import`
shell -- which must therefore never be loaded in the same me3 profile as the product DLL. Its label
bytes live in `SYSTEM_QUIT_LOAD_BUILD_URL_LABEL_W`, beside the two above.

The label bytes live in `SYSTEM_QUIT_LOAD_PROFILE_LABEL_W` and
`SYSTEM_QUIT_LOAD_SAVE_PROFILES_LABEL_W` (`system_quit_dialog_handlers.rs`) -- the symbols
kept the old names while their contents changed, which is exactly the trap this table
exists to close. An agent that quotes the old name "Load Profile" at the user is naming a
button that has not been on screen since July. Do not settle for a weaker solution that technically "works"
but does not actually reach that bar. When a path looks blocked, that is a signal to
find the *real* solution at a deeper layer -- not to lower the bar.

**Validate the way a USER would (reframe 2026-07-19, supersedes the old "zero-input"
framing -- do NOT reintroduce `simulated_button_presses_total = 0` / "no simulated input"
as the goal).** The point is confidence that a real user can drive the feature to world
readiness, so the TEST must follow a path CLOSE to how a user does it: navigate the menu
**with input**, respecting the game's real input-enable **delays** (the game gates when
you can move / open the menu / press a button after a load). Drive that navigation via the
input-harness DLL's **direct-memory native-binding injection** (`inputmgr+0x90+eventId`,
which mimics a user's presses at the native binding) -- NOT a menu-bypassing direct-arm
shortcut (that skips the exact user path being validated) and NOT synthesized OS-layer
input (XInput/DInput/SendInput, which native ER does not route). The deliverable is still a
single DLL loaded through me3 as a `[[natives]]` profile entry (LazyLoader removed
2026-07-04), compatible with offline-vanilla, Seamless Co-op, and other mods (see bd memory
`autoload-dll-product-requirements`), with the load2 flow decoupled into the input-harness
DLL (toggled by profile inclusion). "Architecturally hard" is not "impossible" -- keep
reverse-engineering until the real mechanism is found. Surface trade-offs honestly, but the
bar is the actual goal, never a fallback.

When a native menu/load path appears to need a manually pumped `MenuJob`, treat that as a red flag
that the integration boundary is wrong. Do **not** build a recurring private pump as the product fix.
Instead, reverse the native ownership path: create/build the correct job, store/retain it in the same
kind of native slot the game uses, enqueue/submit it through the proper MenuJob queue/owner, and trigger
that queued job from the native OK/confirm transition when the verified semaphores say the press would
hit the intended option. Manual per-frame pumping is only a bounded diagnostic to prove job behavior;
the product path must be native enqueue + native pump ownership.

## Upstream (`fromsoftware-rs`)

**Never file, open, or propose filing an upstream issue/PR/report** (against
`fromsoftware-rs` or any other external project) -- not even as a recommendation or
follow-up. When our code and upstream disagree (e.g. a struct offset mismatch), resolve
it **in this repo**: confirm the correct value via static RE of the binary, fix or pin our
side, and record the finding in `bd` for the next agent. Treat upstream as a read-only
reference we adopt from, never as a place we contribute back to.

## Build & Test

This repo must be a sibling of a `fromsoftware-rs` checkout (the root crate uses `../fromsoftware-rs` path dependencies).

```bash
# Full quality gate: lossy-UTF8 lint, cargo fmt --all -- --check,
# and a windows-target cargo check (cross-compiled from Linux via cargo-xwin).
bash scripts/check.sh

# Host-buildable workspace members (no game dependencies):
cargo test -p er-soulsformats -p er-param-inspect
cargo check -p er-soulsformats -p er-param-inspect

# The game DLL itself (cross-compiled to x86_64-pc-windows-msvc from Linux via cargo-xwin):
cargo xwin build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
# Output: target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/er_quickload.dll

# ...but that builds ONLY er-quickload. The workspace sets
#     default-members = ["crates/er-quickload"]
# so the bare command above silently skips EVERY other DLL crate -- er-invasion-warp,
# er-loading-portrait, er-save-picker, and the rest. It exits 0 in a fraction of a
# second having compiled nothing, which reads exactly like a successful incremental build.
# For any other DLL, name it:
cargo xwin build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc -p er-invasion-warp
```

**Check the output hash before staging or launching.** A build that "succeeded" without
recompiling leaves the previous DLL in place, and a runtime run against it produces evidence for
code that is not the code under test -- a failure mode indistinguishable from the feature not
working. `sha256sum target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/<name>.dll` before and after is enough.

**Prefer `scripts/er-build-dlls.sh <package>...` (or `--all`) over a bare `cargo xwin build`
whenever the DLL is going to be RUN.** It is the same cargo invocation with the `-p` flags filled
in from `scripts/me3-dll-list.py`, plus one thing bare cargo cannot do afterwards: it records
`<artifact>.provenance.json`, a content hash over the package's compiled dependency closure taken
while that tree was the one being compiled. Every launch script gates on that record
(`scripts/er-dll-freshness.sh` -> `scripts/er-dll-provenance.py verify`) and REFUSES rather than
launch an artifact it cannot tie to this tree. A DLL produced by a bare `cargo xwin build` carries
no such record, so those scripts will refuse it -- correctly, since nothing proves what it is.
`scripts/check-rust-build.sh` re-attests all 26 shells after its own relink for the same reason.

## Architecture Overview

- `crates/er-quickload/src/lib.rs` -- the injectable DLL. On `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH` it spawns a recurring game task (via `CSTaskImp`) that watches the local player's TimeAct animation queue and applies the selected SpEffects, runtime probes, and native title/load instrumentation.
- `data/effects.json` -- the named SpEffect call list, embedded into the DLL at compile time and validated offline against `SpEffectParam`.
- `crates/soulsformats` (`er-soulsformats`) -- host-side library that drives a generated .NET "bridge" project against Smithbox's `Andre.Formats`/SoulsFormats to read `regulation.bin` params. Also contains the parser for FastSpEffectRecon Ghidra output (`recon` module).
- `tools/er-param-inspect` -- CLI over `er-soulsformats`: inspect param rows and validate `data/effects.json` against a regulation file.
- `docs/` -- reference-tree research notes and recon data (`docs/recon/`).

## Conventions & Patterns

- Prefer named `const`/`static` declarations for reverse-engineered RVAs, offsets, and structure sizes when that improves reviewability; use `scripts/audit-fromsoft-candidates.py` for inventory/triage instead of a blanket magic-number lint.
- **No lossy UTF-8**: `String::from_utf8_lossy` is banned unless the line (or the line above) carries a `// UTF-8 Lossy:` justification (`scripts/check-no-lossy-utf8.py`).
- Game-thread state is shared with the render loop via `Arc<Mutex<EffectsState>>`; lock with `state_or_return` (recovers from poisoning) and never hold the lock across game calls longer than needed.
- The overlay defaults network sync **off**; `apply_speffect(id, dont_sync)` takes an inverted flag -- keep the inversion contained in `EffectCallKind::apply`.
