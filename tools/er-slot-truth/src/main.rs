//! Print which character slots a save container actually holds -- the same question, and the same
//! parser, the DLL now asks before it will wait on a Continue slot.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-03 `er-quickload.toml` named `slot=1`, Seamless was loaded so the
//! game read `ER0000.co2`, and that container holds exactly one character, in slot 0. Slot 1 could
//! never fill, but the boot could not tell "vacant" from "still filling" and spent 1800 ticks of
//! patience finding out; the run reached the intro cutscene first. The DLL now asks the container
//! before waiting (`configured_slot_holds_a_character`), and this tool asks the identical question
//! offline through the identical `er_save_loader::bnd4::active_character_slots`, so the runtime
//! decision can be predicted -- and reviewed -- without launching the game.
//!
//! Usage: cargo run -p er-slot-truth -- <save container>... [--slot N]
