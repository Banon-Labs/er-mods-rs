"""Fail when this repo names a `fromsoftware-rs` item the CI-pinned revision does not have.

WHY THIS IS A GATE AND NOT A NOTE
---------------------------------
The workspace uses `../fromsoftware-rs` PATH dependencies, and CI clones that sibling at one
exact revision (`FROMSOFTWARE_RS_REV` in `.github/workflows/check.yml`). A developer's sibling
is whatever they have checked out -- frequently a fork branch carrying types upstream has not
merged. Nothing reconciles the two, so `scripts/check.sh` compiles against the fork, goes green,
and CI then fails on `unresolved import` for a name that only ever existed on one machine.

That is not hypothetical: PRs #322 and #323 could not compile in CI at all because they used
`eldenring::cs::MsgRepositoryImp`, which exists only in a local fork. Both were locally green.

Rebuilding the whole workspace against the pinned revision would catch it, and costs a second
full cross-compile. This is the cheap 99%: extract every `fromsoftware-rs` item this repo names
by path, and confirm the pinned revision defines it. Pure text against `git show`, no checkout,
no compile, no network.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE
------------------
Type-level drift -- a field that moved, a signature that changed, a trait that lost a method.
Only a real build catches those. This gate is about the failure that actually happened twice:
naming something upstream does not have at all.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check-fromsoftware-symbols.py
    python3 scripts/check-fromsoftware-symbols.py --selftest

SKIPS (exit 0) when the sibling clone is absent or does not contain the pinned revision -- a
machine without it cannot answer the question, and a gate that fails on absence would just be
noise. CI always has it.
