"""Shared primitives for the branch-launch pipeline: sleepless waits and run state.

Two rules shape everything here
-------------------------------
1. **No sleeps as synchronization** (`scripts/check-no-timeouts.py`). Readiness is an
   *event*; a timeout is only a safety backstop. So waiting for a log line blocks on inotify
   and waiting for a process to exit blocks on a pidfd -- in both cases `select()` returns
   the instant the thing happens, and the timeout exists solely so a wedged run cannot hang
   a caller forever.
2. **Every agent-facing shell op is capped at 30s.** Callers pass bounds under that; the
   waits below are written so a caller can loop over short bounded waits and stay responsive
   rather than asking for one long one.

This module exists because seven scripts in this directory each grew their own copy of the
same ctypes inotify block. New code in this pipeline uses this one instead of making it
eight.
