# Called by scripts/hooks/pre-push before the gate suite. Run its selftest directly:
#
#     bash scripts/check-runtime-evidence.sh --selftest
#
# The question it asks is whether a run artifact exists whose DLL says it was built from the commit
# being pushed. The evidence is the first line every shell in this workspace writes to its own log:
#
#     build git=b6b459560dfa module=er_invasion_warp.dll base=0x... pe=0x... (2026-09-09T02:05:18Z)
#
# That sha is what ties a run to code, and a file timestamp does not. The first version of this
# check compared mtimes and answered "evidence present" for head 0e084240 on a log whose own first
# line read `build git=b6b45956` -- a DLL two commits older, still running and still writing, so its
# file was newer than the commit it could not possibly have executed. Reading a clock and calling it
# provenance is the exact mistake this exists to stop.
#
# Which directories hold those logs, and when a `+dirty` line still counts, are decided by
# `scripts/er-runtime-evidence.py` rather than here -- the same module the two cupcake signals read,
# so the pre-push hook and the tool-call guard cannot answer differently about one push. Its header
# carries the reasoning; the short version is that the game directory counts as well as the run root
# (a `~/Elden/launch.sh` run writes only there), and that a `+dirty` log is evidence only when a
# provenance record proves the shell's own dependency closure was committed.
#
# Three things it deliberately leaves alone:
#   * a push that changes no crate. Docs, scripts and policies have nothing for a run to prove, and
#     a guard that fires on everything is one the next agent overrides by reflex.
#   * whether the run went well. A run that executed the code and went badly is a fact worth
#     pushing with; a run that never executed it is not evidence of anything.
#   * a tree it cannot measure. No run root, no git, no readable log -- it says so and allows,
#     because a check that cannot see must not invent a verdict.
#
# Which repository it measures, checked rather than assumed (2026-09-13). The cupcake signals that
# answer the same question got this wrong: they ran `git rev-parse HEAD` in whatever directory the
# signal process started in, which is the session's, so `cd <another worktree> && git push` was
# judged on the session's tip. This copy is not exposed to that, and the reason is in the hook
# rather than here: `scripts/hooks/pre-push` takes `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, cds to it, and
# unsets `git rev-parse --local-env-vars` before calling anything, so every `git` below resolves
# from the working tree being pushed. The relative `python3 scripts/er-change-scope.py` resolves
# from that same directory, which is why it is relative and must stay so even though `$repo_root`
# is at hand: with `core.hooksPath` pointing at the main checkout, `$repo_root` is the main
# checkout while the push may come from any working tree.
#
# The override is `ER_ALLOW_UNPROVEN_PUSH=1`, and it prints what is being waived.

# A run proves the tip when the tip adds nothing cargo would compile on top of what ran.
#
# Without this the guard fires on its own author. The commit that added it changes only policy and
# a probe script, so no rebuild could produce a DLL different from the one already running -- and
# it was refused anyway, because the branch's cumulative diff touches crates/. A guard that demands
# a fifteen-minute rebuild-and-relaunch to publish a shell script is one the next agent overrides
# by reflex, which its own header warns against.
#
# The question is answered by scripts/er-change-scope.py, the same reverse-dependency walk the
# compile gate uses, rather than by a second opinion written here: `--rust-touched` exits 3 for
# "provably no cargo work required" and 0 otherwise, and it fails open -- a git failure, an
# unresolvable base, or any build input outside a single crate directory all answer 0, which keeps
# the refusal. So this can only ever forgive a diff that provably cannot change a DLL.
#
# One narrow exception on top of it, because that tool answers a different question than this one.
# `er-change-scope.py` decides what CI must RE-run, so it treats `.github/` as a build input and
# widens to everything -- correct there, since a workflow edit changes what CI compiles. It is the
# wrong answer here: a workflow file cannot end up inside a DLL. The refusal it produced was a
# commit that edits `.github/workflows/check.yml` and nothing else, told to rebuild and relaunch
# Elden Ring to prove a `curl` flag.
#
# So a diff confined to `.github/`, `.cupcake/` and `scripts/` also carries forward. The three are
# named explicitly rather than inferred, and the claim was checked rather than assumed: all nine
# build scripts in the workspace were read for the paths they open and the processes they spawn,
# and none reaches any of the three -- the only `Command::new` in any of them is `git`. The scope
# tool already forgives the latter two on their own; this exists for the diff that also touches
# `.github/`, which drags the whole answer to "everything".
#
# `docs/` is deliberately absent. `crates/er-game-base/build.rs` reads `docs/recon/*.tsv`, so a
# docs diff can change a DLL, which is why the safe set is a short measured list rather than a
# guess at what looks harmless.
# Split out so the selftest can assert the two halves separately: the second case below is only
# meaningful if the first one would have refused on its own.
