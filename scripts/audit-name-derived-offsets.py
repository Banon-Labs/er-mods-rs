"""Census: every hand-written field-offset constant, with the provenance its comment claims.

THE CLASS THIS LOOKS FOR
------------------------
`CS_SYSTEM_STEP_CURRENT_STATE_OFFSET` was 0x40 for its whole life and the field is at 0x48. It
was never measured -- it was back-solved from a member NAME in the sibling `fromsoftware-rs`
crate (`unk48` sits after `requested_state`, so "current_state must be 0x40"). That member is
itself misnamed. A wrong-but-readable offset returns a legal value of the right width forever:
no fault, no refusal, and no 1.16.2-vs-1.17 drift for a drift check to see, because it is
equally wrong in both builds.

So this census does not ask "is the value right" -- it cannot know that. It asks WHERE THE VALUE
CAME FROM, by reading the comment block above each definition and bucketing it:

  MEASURED   -- cites an address, an instruction, a witness function, an alignment result
  NAME       -- cites a struct member, an `unkNN`, `offset_of!`, a sibling-crate declaration
  NONE       -- no provenance at all (weaker than wrong provenance, not stronger)

Run it to re-derive the sweep; it is a report, not a gate. The gate that owns the findings is
`scripts/check-object-field-offsets-1170.py`.

BYTE COVERAGE, THE SECOND QUESTION
----------------------------------
`pair-object-field-drift.py` reports the DISPLACEMENT of each memory operand, which is the right
unit for "did the field move". It is the wrong unit for "is this byte a field at all": a
`mov word [rbx+0xbc8],0` initialises 0xbc8 AND 0xbc9, and only 0xbc8 appears in the displacement
set. Absence from that set is therefore not absence of a field -- unless nothing WIDE ENOUGH
covers the byte either. `--cover` answers that: for one function extent and one list of byte
offsets, every access whose `[disp, disp+size)` interval contains the byte.

This is the distinction the `CS_SYSTEM_STEP_CURRENT_STATE_OFFSET` finding turned on. 0x40 was not
merely absent from the displacement set; NOTHING in the step-template constructor covered it,
because the slot belongs to a different constructor entirely.

WHICH ROWS THE NUMBER IS ABOUT, THE THIRD QUESTION
-------------------------------------------------
Provenance is only half of an actionable number. The first census reported `NONE=654`, and that
population contained `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH = 1` (the name regex matched the `_AT` inside `ATTACH`),
the whole Windows x64 `CONTEXT` register file, PE header offsets, SPIR-V enum values, and offsets
into buffers this workspace itself defines. None of those can be wrong in the way
`CS_SYSTEM_STEP_CURRENT_STATE_OFFSET` was wrong -- an unmeasured displacement onto a LIVE GAME
OBJECT, returning a legal value of the right width forever.

So each row also gets a KIND, and the headline number counts only `GAME`:

  GAME          an ELDEN RING object-field offset; the population this census exists to size
  OS-ABI        Windows / MSVC-ABI / PE-COFF layout -- not FromSoftware's, cannot drift with a
                game patch, and verified against the published structure in the kinds table
  MACHINE-CODE  a byte offset inside an x86-64 instruction encoding
  OUR-OWN       an offset into a structure this workspace defines
  FORMAT        an offset into a file this workspace parses
  NOT-AN-OFFSET an enum value, a count, a limit -- the name regex over-matched

`GAME` is the DEFAULT: a row is only demoted by the name-shape rule (below) or by an explicit
line in `scripts/offset-census-kinds.tsv` that says why, which is a line a reviewer can argue
with. Widening the regex instead would shrink the number without making it truer and leave no
trace of which rows went.

AND ONE MORE PROVENANCE SOURCE
------------------------------
`scripts/check-object-field-offsets-1170.py::PINNED_CONSTANTS` is a table of constants that gate
has already measured against both images and re-measures every run. A bare comment above such a
constant is not missing provenance -- the provenance lives in the gate. Those rows are imported
(not copied) and bucketed `PINNED`.

USAGE
    python3 scripts/audit-name-derived-offsets.py [--bucket NAME|NONE|MEASURED|PINNED]
    python3 scripts/audit-name-derived-offsets.py --kind GAME     # just the counted population
    python3 scripts/audit-name-derived-offsets.py --show-excluded # what the shape rule dropped
    python3 scripts/audit-name-derived-offsets.py --selftest
    python3 scripts/audit-name-derived-offsets.py --cover 0x140675ea0:6895:0x140676cf0:6895 \
        --base rbx --base rcx --byte 0xbc8 --byte 0xbc9

`--all` is accepted and ignored. It used to mean "also scan the file-format crates"; those rows
are now always scanned and bucketed `FORMAT`, because a row that is silently not scanned is a row
nobody can audit.

    THE BLIND SPOT THIS FOLLOWS A `lea` TO CLOSE
    --------------------------------------------
    A `this`-relative displacement census sees only what is written through `this`. Where the
    compiler hands a whole embedded sub-object to a register in one `lea` and writes the interior
    through THAT register, every interior field is invisible:

        lea   rbx, [rsi+0xb98]     ; the DLDateTime at GameMan+0xb98
        mov   qword [rbx], r14     ; -> 0xb98   -- visible, disp is off `this`
        and   qword [rbx+8], r12   ; -> 0xba0   -- INVISIBLE, disp is off rbx

    0xba0 was named `LOAD_HANDLE` from the shape of whatever value sat there, and 0xdf0 was named
    a "resident device" pointer the same way, because neither ever appeared in a displacement set
    for anything to contradict. Struct-in-struct layouts are everywhere in this codebase, so the
    silence is systematic rather than incidental.

    So `alias` maps a 64-bit register root to `(root base, displacement from it)`, established by
    a `lea` off a tracked base (or off another alias, which chains), and destroyed the moment
    anything else writes that register. An access through an alias is reported at its EFFECTIVE
    displacement, with the `lea` that established it printed alongside so the attribution can be
    audited rather than taken on trust.

    `end` is an absolute file offset from `function_extent`, not a byte budget: past the
    function's last byte this decode would be reading the de-Arxan'd images' leftover bytes and
    inventing accesses out of them.
