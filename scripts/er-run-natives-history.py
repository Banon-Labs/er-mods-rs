"""Which past runs loaded a given DLL, and did that run's own log survive?

Answers "I tested that before" with evidence instead of memory. Every run staged by
`scripts/er-run-branch.py` keeps a `me3-launcher.log`, and me3 writes its whole attach config
into it -- including the full `natives:` list. That list is the only surviving record of what was
in the process, because a DLL's own game-directory log is single-slot: `begin_fresh_run` rotates
`<name>` to `<name>.prev` and truncates on the first write of each process, so two launches later
the run's testimony is gone. The launcher log is not rotated, so it outlives the thing it
describes.

That asymmetry is the reason this script exists. Reconstructed on 2026-09-09, one shell had been
loaded by 43 separate runs and exactly two of their logs still existed -- neither of them the run
anyone wanted -- because that crate was the one loaded DLL with no `ER_QUICKLOAD_*_PATH` redirect
knob, so no launcher could move its log into the run directory. The knob was added the same day;
`scripts/er-artifact-redirect-audit.py` is what keeps every launcher setting it. (That shell was
`er-lockon-filter`, deleted on 2026-09-11 by user directive; the episode is written up in
docs/recon/lockon-filter-findings.md.)
