"""Watch a live ELDEN RING for a measured window and report whether it survived.

WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHY F9 IS NOT IN THE NAME
------------------------------------------------
This tool was called `er-f9-loop-proof` because the claim it was built for was "repeatedly F9-load
for N minutes without crashing". The measurement killed that framing: the 0x140010043 fault is
TIME-triggered, not action-triggered. Five recorded faults land at 43.8-56.1s regardless of what
was happening, and one of them arrived with nothing pressed at all. So the press count is not the
independent variable and never was -- the DLL combination and the wall-clock are. A name that puts
F9 at the centre advertises a causal role the evidence does not support, and would have the next
reader tuning a cadence that changes nothing.

So the default is to press NOTHING and watch. `--warp` remains, because the OTHER failure this
build has to survive -- a main-thread hard lock inside me3's own infinite mutex -- has only ever
been seen AFTER a completed map jump. The independent variable there is the WARP, not the key: F9
is merely what `er-hotkey-config` happens to bind it to, and a run's metric is therefore warps
COMPLETED, read from the DLL's own `ARRIVED` line. A press count says how hard the driver leaned on
a key; only the arrival count says the feature ran.

THE VERDICT IS THE PROCESS AND THE RECORDS, NEVER THE SCREEN
------------------------------------------------------------
Stop/continue comes from RAM/process telemetry: the game's own liveness, the crash logger's record
count, a `PANIC in` line, and the watchdog's main-thread-stall HANG report -- a lockup writes no
exception record at all, so the record count alone is blind to it. No screenshot is taken and none
would be trusted; AGENTS.md forbids a visual oracle as the run-stopping signal.

EVERY WAIT BLOCKS ON AN EVENT. Readiness is the game's own `player_present` telemetry, the warp
cadence is the DLL's own `ARRIVED` line, focus is Hyprland's `.socket2.sock`, and the file waits
are inotify. Nothing here sleeps, and the only durations are backstops: the watch window (derived
from the worst recorded time-to-first-fault) and the repo's canonical runtime cap.

F9 IS REACHABLE FROM OS-LEVEL INJECTION when it is used, and that is a fact about this specific key
rather than a general licence. AGENTS.md is explicit that synthesized OS input does NOT reach
native ELDEN RING bindings, which the game reads through DirectInput/XInput. `er_invasion_warp`'s
warp hotkeys are not native bindings: `er-hotkey-config` polls them with `GetAsyncKeyState` (see
`keys.rs`, `VK_F9 == 0x78`). A uinput key event is a real kernel input event, so it reaches the
compositor, then Wine, then exactly the state `GetAsyncKeyState` reads. This driver is therefore
correct for the warp keys and would be WRONG for anything the game itself binds.

WINDOW TARGETING IS FAIL-CLOSED AND NARROW when pressing, and here that is a safety property: a
uinput press is system-wide, so an unfocused game means every press lands in whatever the user
actually has in front of them. Focus is asserted by CLASS and confirmed before each press; nothing
else about the desktop is enumerated or printed -- the privacy rule in AGENTS.md exists because a
window list exposes every unrelated app the user is running.
