"""Replay REAL past turns through the unexecuted-promise guard and count how many it would halt.

The `no_unexecuted_promise` Stop guard is only worth having if it stays quiet on ordinary turns: a
guard that cries wolf gets ignored, which is worse than no guard. Unit tests prove the shapes the
author thought of; this proves the shapes the author did NOT think of, by running the real signal
over the session transcripts the agent has actually written.

For every turn boundary in a transcript it builds a fixture from the preceding window of events and
runs `.cupcake/signals/last_assistant_unexecuted_promise.sh` against it under a temporary HOME, then
reports every turn that would have been halted and the clause it would have quoted back. Read the
hits: each one is either a real instance of the defect (good) or a false positive to narrow away.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/audit-unexecuted-promise-false-positives.py [--window=N] [transcript.jsonl ...]

With no arguments it audits the newest transcripts for THIS repo under ~/.claude/projects/.
Read-only: it never writes to the transcripts, and its fixtures live in a temp dir that is removed.
