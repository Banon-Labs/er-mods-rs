"""Every DLL that installs detours must install a log sink, or its refusals are invisible.

Each cdylib STATICALLY LINKS its own copy of `er-hook` and `er-game-base`, so the logger those
crates call through is a per-DLL static. A DLL that never installs one is not quiet about
unimportant things -- it is silent about the two lines that say a feature just went inert:

    HOOK REFUSED (...)      a detour was not installed, because the address has no verified
                            mapping for the running build
    ADDRESS REFUSED (...)   a game address was not used, for the same reason

What that costs, measured on 2026-08-28: `er-armament-icons` logged four
`MH_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION` failures. That code is BOTH MinHook's genuine "I cannot hook this
function" AND the code `MhHook::new` returns when the build gate refuses the address -- and one of
the four was `0x1411ced80`, which IS in the verified translation table and therefore should have
been translated, not refused. With no sink installed there was no line distinguishing the two, so
a real question about whether the audit was wrong could not be answered from a whole game run.

`er_hook::set_hook_logger` installs BOTH sinks, so one call satisfies this. A crate that resolves
addresses without hooking (no `er-hook` dependency) installs
`er_game_base::game_build::set_address_logger` directly.

    Deleting the sentence would have been the wrong fix: the gate is meant to key on what a crate
    DOES, and a comment is the one place a name appears without doing anything.

    String literals are tracked (plain, raw, and char literals) only so a `//` or `/*` inside one
    cannot desynchronise the scan -- their CONTENTS are kept, because a hook call has never been
    written inside a string and dropping them would be a way to hide one.
