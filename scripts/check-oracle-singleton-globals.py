"""Guard the game singletons the telemetry oracles read: resolved in source, corroborated in the image.

WHAT WENT WRONG, AND WHY NOTHING CAUGHT IT
==========================================
`er-telemetry-core`'s `standalone_tick` read four game singletons through a closure that added the
1.16.2 RVA straight to the module base:

    let read_singleton = |rva: usize| -> usize {
        unsafe { er_game_base::mem::safe_read_usize(base + rva) }.unwrap_or(0)
    };

Every `.data` global moved on 1.17. The reads did not fail -- they SUCCEEDED against whatever now
occupies the old address. Across all 4,350 records of run `br-20260831-160354-2513`:

    oracle_game_data_man_ptr  = "0x6e614d6e6f697463"   little-endian ASCII "ctionMan"
    oracle_game_man_ptr       = "0x0"
    oracle_cs_menu_man_ptr    = "0x0"
    oracle_play_time_ms       = -1                     derived from GameDataMan
    oracle_flip_task_delta    = -1.0                   derived from CSFlipperImp
    oracle_flip_fixed_spf     = -1.0

`"ctionMan"` is eight bytes out of the middle of the RTTI type name
`.?AVNWSteamConnectionManager@DLNW3@@`, which 1.17 parks at the old GameDataMan address. The other
three stale slots landed in still-blank `.data`, and a zero pointer is indistinguishable from a
global the game has not created yet. THAT is the failure mode this gate exists for: a wrong
pointer oracle does not go quiet, it goes CONSTANT, and a constant is invisible.

Three existing gates all reported clean the whole time, correctly, because none of them is looking
at this:

  * `check-stale-rva-calls.py` keys on a NAMED constant next to the module base. Here the constant
    is a closure PARAMETER, so there is nothing at the read site to name.
  * `check-no-stale-callsite-rva.py` is about comparing live stack addresses to raw RVAs.
  * `check-oracle-writers.py` asks whether a counter has a writer, not where a read points.

WHAT THIS GATE CHECKS
=====================
SOURCE half (always runs, ratcheted by `docs/recon/ungated-module-base-arithmetic.txt`). Any
ARITHMETIC on the game module base whose right-hand side is a compiled-in 1.16.2 claim, when the
result is not handed to something that resolves it. The address of a game global has to come from
`er_game_base::mem::game_data_addr` (or `game_rva` / `read_global_ptr` / `resolve_game_address`),
which translates through the verified 1.16.2 -> 1.17 map and answers `0` for an address with no
mapping.

WIDENED 2026-08-31, because the fixed site's SPELLING is not the class. A sweep of the whole
workspace for the shape found three more live 1.17 defects, and not one was a `safe_read_*` with a
lowercase RVA:

  * `safe_read_usize(module_base + 0x3d6b7b0)` -- a HEX LITERAL on a base that arrives as a
    function PARAMETER (`er-title-flow/src/title_tick_cover.rs`, three sites; both RVAs are in the
    shipped ledger, and the same file resolves the same two addresses correctly elsewhere);
  * `CS_INGAME_PAD_TYPEID_RVAS.map(|rva| base + rva)` -- the RVA is an ELEMENT of a const array and
    the result is COMPARED, not read (`er-input-harness/src/pad_inject.rs`). That is the silent
    end of the family: the std::map walk simply never matches, so the in-world input drive is inert
    with no fault, no refusal and no counter moving;
  * `base.wrapping_add(MSGBOX_DIALOG_UPDATE_RVA)` -- a spelling no `+`-shaped pattern can see,
    including `check-stale-rva-calls.py`, whose entire job is `base + CONSTANT`.

So the two halves of the rule are decided from EVIDENCE, never from either identifier's name:

  IS IT THE MODULE BASE?  From the BINDING. A `let` from `game_module_base`/`GetModuleHandle`, or
                          -- new -- a PARAMETER that the same file passes as the first argument to
                          `game_data_addr` and friends, whose first parameter IS the module base.
                          A name shadowed by a `for` pattern or a closure is NOT the module base,
                          which is what keeps `for &(base, cnt) in GROUPS` (a table of struct
                          offsets) and `let base = ersc_module_base()` (a different DLL) out.
  IS IT A 1.16.2 CLAIM?   From the RVA's PROVENANCE. A literal in [0x1000, 0x0800_0000), or a
                          binding that was not READ OUT OF THE RUNNING IMAGE. An RVA the code read
                          from the live PE (`base + e_lfanew`, `base + vaddr`) is already correct
                          for the running build and translating it would be the bug -- the same
                          distinction `MhHook::new_runtime_derived` draws.

And a sum handed to `resolve_game_address` / `resolve_detour_address` / `MhHook::new` /
`register_union_hook` is CORRECT and excluded: those perform the single resolve themselves, and
resolving first would translate twice, which lands on a third unrelated function whenever an
address is both one row's destination and another row's source.

IMAGE half (skips when the two de-Arxan'd images are absent, e.g. in CI). For each singleton the
oracles read, the 1.17 address is RE-DERIVED from the two images -- not read out of the ledger and
believed -- and compared against the shipped `rva-map-1162-to-1170.data.tsv` row:

  1. find every `mov <r64>, [rip+disp]` in the 1.16.2 image whose target is the 1.16.2 global;
  2. take a short window at each such site, blank the four displacement bytes, and keep only the
     windows that are UNIQUE in 1.16.2 -- a shape that already occurs twice cannot identify
     anything;
  3. find that masked window in the 1.17 image; keep only the ones that occur exactly ONCE there;
  4. read the 1.17 displacement and let each site vote for a target.

A site whose surrounding code was edited between the builds simply fails to match and casts no
vote, so an edit costs evidence rather than producing a wrong answer. `MIN_VOTES` independent
agreeing sites and unanimity among the sites that did match are required.

Then the shape of the destination is checked, because the ledger being self-consistent is not the
same as the address being a manager pointer:

  * the derived address is 8-byte aligned and its qword is zero at rest in the static image, which
    is what an uninitialised pointer global looks like;
  * it does not sit inside a printable-ASCII run -- the RTTI/string-literal test that the stale
    GameDataMan address FAILS on 1.17. That failure is asserted as a positive control, so a
    detector that has quietly stopped detecting cannot pass this gate.
