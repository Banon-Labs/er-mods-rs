"""The one place a launcher learns where this run's artifacts go.

Why this is a module and not five copies
----------------------------------------
The bug that started all of this was a launcher that redirected the autoload debug log and the crash
log out of the game directory, and not the continue trace. One line of env, missing from one array,
and the 11:09 run destroyed the 09:07 run's 5.4 MB `er-quickload-continue-trace.log` -- a whole day's
evidence, gone, with no error anywhere. Copying that array into every Python launcher would have set
the same trap five more times: the next artifact gets added to four of them.

A game-directory artifact is single-slot. `er_game_base::log::begin_fresh_run` renames `<name>` to
`<name>.prev` and truncates on the first write of each process -- One generation -- so two launches
lose the run before last, and several sessions launch concurrently in this repo, which makes that the
normal case rather than a race. Redirecting the writer at launch, into a directory unique to the run,
means two runs never share a path; a copy at teardown cannot help, because by then this run has
already clobbered the previous one's file, and a crashed or killed run never reaches the copy at all.

`scripts/er-artifact-redirect-audit.py` reads the knob table out of the Rust sources and fails when
this table is missing one, so a new DLL artifact cannot quietly stay unredirected.

    Existence decides, not configuration. The redirect is set from the launcher's side; whether the
    DLL honoured it depends on the environment surviving the whole launch chain, and returning a
    path that is not there would make a healthy run look silent.

    `newer_than` is the other half of that, and it is not optional for a reader that resolves at
    launch time. The game-directory copy of a redirected artifact is the previous run's file, sitting
    on disk with its final contents, and it exists for the whole window between the launcher starting
    the watcher and the DLL writing the redirect for the first time -- a couple of seconds. A reader
    that resolves inside that window binds to the last run's answers and never looks again.

    Measured 2026-08-31, run wedge-writers-20260831-a: the same-character watcher resolved at t=0,
    fell through to the game directory, read `system_quit_continue_confirm_fresh_deser_count = 2` and
    `oracle_player_present = true` from a run that had ended, declared "epoch 2: WORLD-STABLE reached"
    at elapsed 0.0s, wrote no switch-control file, and tore down a game that had not finished booting.
    The report said `NEVER ARMED ... Trigger never invoked`, which is true and reads as a product
    failure. The same shape explains a frozen-telemetry verdict: a stale file's mtime never changes,
    so a watcher bound to one reports `TELEMETRY_FROZEN_HUNG` against a perfectly healthy game.

    So pass the run's own start time and RE-resolve until it returns something: a candidate older
    than the run cannot be this run's, and returning the run directory's not-yet-existing path is the
    honest answer -- the caller reads nothing and waits, instead of reading someone else's evidence.
