#!/usr/bin/env bash
# THIS SUITE ACCUMULATES FAILURES. IT DOES NOT STOP AT THE FIRST ONE.
#
# It used to run under `set -e`, and the cost of that was measured twice on 2026-08-31: it went red
# at line 46 on `test-input-harness-static.py` -- whose subject, crates/er-input-harness/src/pad_inject.rs,
# was mid-edit by another agent -- and the ~130 gate invocations after it produced NO VERDICT AT ALL.
# Not pass, not fail, nothing. Earlier the same day the abort was at check-crate-extraction-roadmap.py.
#
# That is the same defect every gate in this file exists to refuse: A GATE THAT NEVER EXECUTED IS
# INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM A GATE THAT PASSED. Agents reported "check.sh is red at X" while holding no
# information whatever about the checks behind X, and several then called their own change green on
# the strength of running a handful by hand. `set -e` also silently made a check's POSITION its
# authority: the identical check is load-bearing at line 46 and decorative at line 900, because
# anything ahead of it going red erases it. In a tree six agents edit concurrently an early red is
# the normal case, so most of this suite was unobserved for most of a day.
#
# So: every step runs, every failure is collected, and the summary at the end gives EVERY step one
# of four states -- passed, FAILED, INCONCLUSIVE (killed before it reached a verdict) and, the
# load-bearing one, NOT RUN, which must never be silent. Exit is non-zero unless every step ran and
# passed; NOT RUN and INCONCLUSIVE are not passes.
#
# ADDING A GATE IS STILL ONE LINE. Nothing has to be registered anywhere: put the invocation on its
# own line, starting in column 1 with `python3` / `bash` / `cargo` / `shellcheck` / `rustfmt` /
# `cupcake` / `opa` / `command -v`, exactly as every line below does. The summary discovers the
# step list by reading THIS FILE back at exit, so an appended gate is classified automatically and
# a `\`-continued multi-line invocation counts once, at its first line. Comments between steps are
# free. The only way to write a step the summary cannot see is to indent it or to hide it inside a
# function or subshell -- so don't.
#
# FAIL-FAST IS STILL AVAILABLE, AS AN EXPLICIT, JUSTIFIED EXCEPTION -- never as the default for all
# ~190 steps. Use it only where a LATER check consumes this step's output, so continuing would
# produce verdicts that are not about anything. The live example is the `command -v cupcake` guard
# below: `|| { echo ...; exit 127; }`. Write that shape deliberately, with the reason next to it;
# the EXIT trap then reports everything after it as NOT RUN instead of letting it vanish.
set -uo pipefail

repo_root=$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)

# --- failure accumulation ------------------------------------------------------------------
# The ERR trap fires on exactly the commands `set -e` would have exited on -- and, verified on
# this bash, NOT on the left side of `||`/`&&` -- so the `command -v opa >/dev/null && opa test ...`
# guards below keep behaving as they always did when opa is absent.
#
# EVERY STEP IS CLASSIFIED BY ITS OWN SOURCE LINE, not by a running count. A count cannot answer
# "which checks have no verdict", which is the only question that matters after an early exit; and
# the count was wrong anyway -- bash fires the DEBUG trap TWICE for a command that goes on to fire
# the ERR trap (measured on this bash), so every failing step was counted as two steps run. Both
# problems disappear when the DEBUG trap records a SET of line numbers and the summary diffs that
# set against the step lines it reads back out of this file.
#
# The step list is SNAPSHOT NOW, at startup, and never re-read. The summary used to grep this file
# back when it finished; that is fine until somebody edits check.sh while a run is in flight, which
# is ordinary in a tree several agents share and happened during this very rewrite. The recorded
# line numbers then point into a file that no longer exists, every row shifts, and the table becomes
# confident nonsense -- the exact failure class this suite exists to refuse, produced by the
# instrument reporting it.

# --- WHICH STEPS CANNOT RUN ON THIS MACHINE ------------------------------------------------
# A FIFTH STATE, AND IT EXISTS BECAUSE OF ONE MEASUREMENT. Run this suite in a tree that has no
# `eldenring-deobf*.bin` -- which is every tree except a developer's, since both images are
# gitignored, game-derived and ~100 MB -- and FOURTEEN gates printed one line saying their input
# was absent and EXITED 0, having asserted nothing whatever. Several say so in their own output:
# `SKIPPED (NOT A PASS) ... no field offset was checked at all`. The summary above still wrote
# `passed` beside every one of them. That is the same defect as `set -e` erasing 130 steps,
# arriving by a different road: a gate whose input was absent is indistinguishable from a gate
# that agreed with the tree.
#
# So a step whose input is missing is now SKIPPED, out loud, with the missing input named -- and
# SKIPPED is not a pass. `scripts/ci-gate-portability.py` owns the decision. It classifies every
# step against a MEASURED ledger (docs/ci-gate-portability.tsv), keyed by the step's command text
# rather than its line number so the ledger survives edits to this file, and `--check` (wired in
# below) refuses a step that has no ledger row -- which is what stops the classification drifting
# the way .github/workflows/check.yml's hand-written step list did.
#
# IF THE MAP CANNOT BE COMPUTED, NOTHING IS SKIPPED. Failing open runs every gate and lets the
# missing input produce a red, which is loud; failing closed would skip the whole suite silently,
# which is the disease. The warning below says which happened.
# `command python3` on purpose: the shim further down would look this line up in a skip map
# that this very line is what builds. It also tells shellcheck (SC2218) that reaching the
# real binary before the function exists is deliberate rather than an ordering mistake.

# DOES A LAUNCH DESTROY THE PREVIOUS RUN'S EVIDENCE? (wired 2026-08-31.) A game-directory artifact
# is SINGLE-SLOT: `er_game_base::log::begin_fresh_run` renames `<name>` to `<name>.prev` and
# truncates on the first write of each process, so two launches and run N-2 is gone -- and several
# sessions launch concurrently here, which makes that the normal case rather than a race. Measured
# 2026-08-31: an 11:09 launch destroyed the 09:07 run's 5.4 MB continue trace before anyone read
# it, and three artifacts keep ZERO generations because they are `fs::write`, not a rotating log.
# It ENUMERATES rather than pattern-matches -- it reads the knob table out of the Rust sources (the
# `env::var` call plus its resolver's own fallback, following `const` identifiers) and finds
# launchers by their actual launch command. That distinction is the point: pattern-matching is how
# this class hid.
#
# The live run PASSES while printing 98 known gaps across 13 launchers, held in
# `scripts/er-artifact-redirect-audit.baseline.txt`. Read that count as a TO-DO LIST, not an
# approval: the baseline records what is already broken, and only NEW drift fails. The count is
# printed on PASSING runs precisely so it cannot rot unseen. 1.2s each.
# Positive control: deleting one knob from `capture-er-frame.sh` (a launcher that currently
# redirects everything, so the gap is genuinely new) goes RED naming the launcher, the knob and the
# consequence -- the baseline does NOT absorb it. Moving the same export line stays green.
#
# TRANSIENTLY RED AS OF 2026-08-31, AND DELIBERATELY LEFT THAT WAY. Six knobs --
# ER_QUICKLOAD_{CPU_PROFILE,DIAG_HARNESS,INPUT_HARNESS_LOG,INPUT_HARNESS_PHASES,RELOAD_TRACE,
# TIMESERIES}_PATH -- appeared in the working tree while this gate was being wired. Measured with
# `git grep <knob> HEAD`: all six are ABSENT at HEAD, so they are another agent's uncommitted
# in-flight work, and that agent has already converted 6 of the 19 launchers. The remaining 13
# have not caught up, which is what the gate is reporting, correctly and for the first time.
#
# The fix is that agent finishing, NOT `--write-baseline`. Regenerating now would freeze somebody
# else's half-done change as ~78 rows of accepted debt and call it green -- which is the precise
# failure this whole sweep was called to undo. Leave it red until the launchers land; the suite
# accumulates failures rather than aborting, so a truthful red here costs a line in the summary
# and nothing else.
# RE-ARMED 2026-08-31, both lines, on the condition the note below asked for: the audit script, its
# baseline AND the launcher changes are now all committed -- the launchers landed in 236b00ce and
# the script and baseline land with this re-arm. Measured against a detached worktree pinned to the
# committed tree, not against a working tree holding the producers: `--selftest` PASS with all its
# reader cases present, and the live run reports 29 launchers / 19 knobs / 1 stated single-slot and
# no NEW gaps -- against the 185 gaps and 4 lost selftest cases the previous note recorded.

# The first is the TEST OF ANOTHER GATE. `check-ifpe-finalization-proof.py` scores a live run's
# artifacts, so it cannot run here; its test is fully synthetic tempdirs, asserts the four failure
# strings in a red case and an empty verdict in a green one, and needs no game and no corpus.
# Nothing ran it, so the scorer's own logic was unguarded. Control: making its `failures.append`
# calls no-ops turns this red; rewording a failure message leaves it green.
#
# The second holds the line that a BLIND census cannot pass. `check-save-suppression.py` returns a
# single verdict by crossing an in-process census against an offline byte witness, and the branch
# that matters is the one where the census reports zero writes while the bytes on disk moved -- it
# must come back FAIL, not PASS. Its ~20 red/green fixtures cover every verdict branch; only
# `--selftest` runs here, because the scoring path needs a real run's telemetry and witness
# snapshots. Control: forcing `evaluate()` to always return passed=True turns this red and names
# `blind census` and `no offline witness` by branch; a comment-only edit stays green.

# or nearly reached the verified table, every one of them carrying `IDENTICAL` over 20-94
# instructions -- because a mid-function address verifies BETTER than a real entry, sitting in a
# neighbourhood that did not change. One (0x140aec480, +0x360 inside 0x140aec120) was merged with
# its own note saying `containing-fn-offset-0x360`, while the real entry (0x140aec570) was already
# written down in crates/er-title-flow, and crates/er-reload-trace carried a raw `rva: 0xaec480`
# HookSpec that would have consumed the licence (since removed, on the same day, by a different

# THE HOLE THE GATE ABOVE LEAVES (wired 2026-08-31; the script existed since 2026-08-30 and was

# leaf has no `.pdata` entry, so it reaches `DETOURABLE_ENTRY_EVIDENCE` through the `NEITHER-ENTRY`
# clause, which asserts nothing about the entry. That is only safe if the address really is a whole
# undescribed function rather than a point in the MIDDLE of a described one -- and
# `add_leaf_extents` tests the weaker premise, skipping a VA only when a `.pdata` entry BEGINS
# there. An address 0x10 bytes into a declared function begins nothing, so it gets a leaf extent,
# so it can reach IDENTICAL-LEAF and carry a detour into the middle of a live function.
# `--fail-on-mid` above does not close this: its GATED_MAPS deliberately exclude
# `docs/recon/rva-map-1162-to-1170.tsv`, which this one reads. 2.3s. Skips, saying so, without the

# THE PER-FIELD HALF, which the census above deliberately cannot do (2026-08-31: WIRED. It had
# been written and left uninvoked, so it caught nothing at all).
#
# A displacement census answers "which offsets does the image read off this object", which cannot
# say WHICH FIELD lives at one and cannot see a move when both the old and new offset are read
# somewhere. This gate instead ALIGNS ONE FUNCTION'S TWO BODIES: when the instruction sequences
# agree except for memory displacements, instruction k is the SAME access to the SAME field in
# both builds, so a displacement difference IS that field moving, by exactly that much. Each row
# names the witness function pair that produced its number; a row that cannot be re-measured is a
# FAILURE, not a pass. It also pins the repo constants those rows verify, and the allocation SIZE
# and class-identity of every object this repo WRITES into -- a wrong offset misinforms, a wrong
# object corrupts the heap.
#
# It carries the one failure a drift check structurally cannot reach: an offset that was never
# right in EITHER build. `CS_SYSTEM_STEP_CURRENT_STATE_OFFSET` was 0x40 against a field at 0x48,
# so `oracle_system_step_label` read a pointer's low half and emitted `"?"` with a legal-looking
# i32 on every run since it was written, with nothing to drift.
#
# Selftest first: 93 perturbations, each of which must go red -- every witness row moved by 4 and
# every HELD row by 8, every allocation size, identity anchor and 1.17 witness address, every write
# bound raised past its allocation, plus a blind matcher, an empty source read and a changed
# constant literal. 2s (it was 82s until the tree scan and the function alignments it repeats ~95
# times over an unchanged tree were memoised; the point of that was not patience but that
# scripts/audit-selftest-vacuity.py allows 25s per script and its blinded replay costs several
# times the plain run, so this gate was UNMEASURABLE for vacuity -- an unjudgeable selftest is an
# unproven one. It now reports PROVABLE).

# `--selftest` is wired here, and it guards the one part of the report that CAN go quietly wrong:
# `scripts/offset-census-kinds.tsv`, the table that demotes a row out of the counted population.
#
# An exclusion nobody re-checks is how a real game-object offset gets reclassified as a Windows
# structure and stops being counted -- the report shrinks and reads as progress. The selftest
# refuses a row naming a constant that no longer exists, refuses an OS-ABI row whose constant no

# may disappear, they may not appear. Its floors carry the same anti-blindness property as the

# equipped items, and the telemetry reported success the whole time.
#
# So this gate asks the question by USE rather than by spelling: what does the workspace hand to
# the address resolver, and can the map answer it? A crate that resolves game addresses and has
# NONE of them mapped fails. Selftest first: it carries a frozen floor under the control crate and

# EIGHT MORE WAYS TO REACH AN ADDRESS WITHOUT THE GATE (wired 2026-08-31). The ratchet above counts
# EXEC/WRITE/READ; this one adds RAW_MINHOOK, PRE_GATE_CHECK, CACHED_ADDR, CONST_FOLD, VTABLE_WRITE,
# INDIRECT_HELPER, DOUBLE_TRANSLATE and UPSTREAM_STATIC, keyed per crate-and-class against
# `scripts/audit-1170-gate-bypass.baseline.json`, failing when any count RISES.
# It was RED on five keys. All five were adjudicated against the source and all five are benign:
# upstream's `SoloParamRepository::instance()` resolves by runtime `.text` pattern scan through
# FromSingleton, not by a pinned RVA; `mem.rs:101`/`:122` are the gate's OWN implementation and its
# `game_rva_for_hook`, which returns an address deliberately unresolved so the hook API owns the
# single resolve; `announce.rs:344` and `er-refill-all/runtime.rs` hand raw targets to
# `register_union_hook`/`register_shared_hook`, which is the REQUIRED form; and
# `er-seamless-bugfixes/lib.rs:430` recomposes `base + rva` from `resolve_call_site_rva`, which
# returns an RVA rather than a VA. Baseline regenerated, and it ratcheted DOWN hard in the process
# -- 116 keys / 251 findings to 87 / 161.
# Worth recording: the baseline committed in 7a7f25b3 did not pass on 7a7f25b3's own tree.
# 1.1s + 5.4s.
# Positive control: injecting a raw `*((base + SOME_RVA) as *mut u8) = 0x90` write goes RED naming
# the crate and both classes it trips (CACHED_ADDR 0->1, UNGATED_ARITH 2->3).

# The comment that stood here from 2026-08-31 to 2026-09-01 named two keys -- er-game-base/mem.rs
# 1->2 and er-seamless-bugfixes/lib.rs 0->1 -- and by the time anyone read it neither drifted any
# more; both are in the baseline at their current counts. That is the failure mode of writing an
# adjudication into a comment beside a disabled line: the prose rots while the line stays off, and
# the next reader cannot tell whether the gate is off for a live reason or a dead one. The
# justification now lives in `_reasons` INSIDE the baseline, keyed by the entry it justifies, and
# `--write-baseline` carries it forward so regenerating the counts cannot silently drop it.
#
# The only key that was still red: er-quickload|VTABLE_WRITE|.../experiments/can_move_probe.rs
# 0 -> 4, the move probe's analog-stick writes at `+0x89c`/`+0x8a0`. Adjudicated IN BOUNDS by
# static RE, not by inspection: the object is `DLUID::PadDevice` = HeapAlloc(0xa68) = 2664 bytes,
# and the 1704-bytes-smaller `FD4::FD4PadDevice` (0x3c0 = 960) that made this look like a heap
# overrun is a DIFFERENT class that merely holds the PadDevices in its +0x10 vector. The decisive
# fact is that the game's own device poll -- the very function this repo detours -- STORES both
# floats on that same `this`, so the offsets are in-bounds by construction. Full derivation in the
# baseline's `_reasons`, and frozen against future drift by six new rows in
# check-object-field-offsets-1170.py (the poll pairs 616/616 with 72 offsets and zero moved).

# THE FOUR WRITE CLASSES THE RATCHET ABOVE CANNOT SEE (wired 2026-08-31). That one counts ungated
# addresses per cdylib; this one names the SHAPES that reach a write without any `base + SOMETHING`
# text to count -- a store into a vtable/function-pointer slot, a `game_data_addr(..) + offset` that
# destroys the 0-means-refused sentinel (a refusal on row 3 yields the address 24, which `if addr
# != 0` waves through), and the byte-patch primitives that take `(base, rva)` as SEPARATE
# ARGUMENTS. It was report-only until today and printed six findings that were every one of them
# false: two were the primitives' own `fn` declarations self-matching, and four were call sites of
# primitives that gate INTERNALLY. Both matcher faults are fixed, the true count is zero, and the
# RVA_ARG class now asks the question actually worth failing over -- does `patch_3byte_stub` /
# `apply_xor_ret_stub` still resolve through `resolve_game_address` -- rather than demanding four
# copies of that rule at the call sites. 1.4s.
# Positive control: deleting the resolve out of `patch_3byte_stub` turns its three call sites RED

# `cargo test` selects ONE of 64 crates, so a crate that is not named here, in
# check-rust-build.sh, or in .github/workflows/check.yml contributes NOTHING to the suite --
# and reports nothing while doing it. Two crates were found in that state by accident on one
# day (er-save-suppress, whose host build was broken outright, and er-build-export, 93 tests
# including the planner-decoder acceptance check); the audit that followed found 20 more.
#
# Crate-granularity bookkeeping would not have been enough. `cargo test -p er-quit-menu-core`
# prints "ok. 43 passed" over a crate with 73 tests, because 30 of them are behind
# `#[cfg(windows)]` and simply do not exist on the host -- not compiled, not listed, not
# failed. So this gate classifies every `#[test]` by the TARGET able to run it (walking `mod`
# declarations, `include!` splices, `#[path]`, file-level `#![cfg(...)]` and the attributes on
# the function itself) and requires a runner on that target. Selftest first, so the gate is
# never trusted on its own say-so; its non-vacuity proof blinds the windows matcher and
# requires the selftest to go red.
# RE-ARMED 2026-09-01. The pair below was UNWIRED on 2026-08-31 because both were red against
# the COMMITTED tree while their fixes sat only in a working tree: er-build-import-runtime's
# windows-only lib, and the `#![cfg_attr(not(windows), allow(dead_code, unused_imports))]` lines
# that let four windows cdylibs compile for the host at all. Every one of those has since landed,

# reported and never run. Measured at re-arming: selftest green, live gate green, and the 251

# EVERY REMAINING HOST-TESTABLE CRATE, IN TWO BATCHES. Up to this line the crates above were
# added one at a time, each by somebody who tripped over the fact that theirs had never run --
# `default-members = ["crates/er-quickload"]` means a bare `cargo test` selects ONE of 64
# crates, so a crate reaches a gate only by being named here. Nothing checked the naming was
# complete, and on 2026-08-31 an audit of all 64 found 20 more crates in exactly that state:
# 279 host-runnable test functions that had never executed once, in any gate, ever. The list
# is not exotic -- the storage-box refill hook, the inventory-sort defaults, the crash-logging
# core, the hotkey parser, the save-suppression core (31 tests), the TPF/FLVER/object codecs.
# All 279 passed the first time they ran, which is the good outcome and not the point: the
# point is that nothing would have said otherwise.
#
# Batched rather than one line per crate because a single cargo invocation resolves and builds
# them in parallel: measured 2.2s + 4.2s warm for the two batches, against ~20 separate
# invocations. scripts/check-test-target-coverage.py is what keeps the list complete from here.
#
# Batch 1 -- the game-adjacent shells and cores. Four of these (er-better-refills,
# er-inventory-sort, er-loading-bar, er-save-disable) did not COMPILE for the host until the
# same day: a windows cdylib's items read as dead on Linux and `[workspace.lints.rust] warnings
# = "deny"` promotes that to a hard error, so `cargo test -p <crate>` failed outright. Fixed
# with the same crate-level `#![cfg_attr(not(windows), allow(dead_code, unused_imports))]` that
# er-save-suppress, er-seamless-bugfixes and er-armament-icons already carry.
# RE-ARMED 2026-09-01. Unwired on 2026-08-31 for a real reason -- er-inventory-sort's crate-level
# allow was in a working tree and in no commit, so the batch stopped at 24 deny-by-default
# dead-code errors -- and then left unwired after that lib.rs landed. All fourteen crate-level
# allows the comment above describes are committed now; measured 2026-09-01, this line runs

# the producer, so it compiles for them and for every gate that builds their tree. Measured on
# this branch 2026-08-31 -- 15b32ab0 and 11af0c60 were both that shape, `origin` did not compile
# for hours, a dozen agents built on top of it, and a210af7f had to land an 18-file compile
