# This suite ACCUMULATES failures. It does not stop at the first one.
#
# It used to run under `set -e`, and the cost of that was measured twice on 2026-08-31: it went red
# at line 46 on `test-input-harness-static.py` -- whose subject, crates/er-input-harness/src/pad_inject.rs,
# was mid-edit by another agent -- and the ~130 gate invocations after it produced no verdict at all.
# Not pass, not fail, nothing. Earlier the same day the abort was at check-crate-extraction-roadmap.py.
#
# That is the same defect every gate in this file exists to refuse: A gate that never executed is
# indistinguishable from a gate that passed. Agents reported "check.sh is red at X" while holding no
# information whatever about the checks behind X, and several then called their own change green on
# the strength of running a handful by hand. `set -e` also silently made a check's position its
# authority: the identical check is load-bearing at line 46 and decorative at line 900, because
# anything ahead of it going red erases it. In a tree six agents edit concurrently an early red is
# the normal case, so most of this suite was unobserved for most of a day.
#
# So: every step runs, every failure is collected, and the summary at the end gives every step one
# of four states -- `passed`, `FAILED`, `INCONCLUSIVE` (killed before it reached a verdict) and, the
# load-bearing one, `NOT RUN`, which must never be silent. Exit is non-zero unless every step ran
# and passed; `NOT RUN` and `INCONCLUSIVE` are not passes.
#
# Adding a gate is still one line. Nothing has to be registered anywhere: put the invocation on its
# own line, starting in column 1 with `python3` / `bash` / `cargo` / `shellcheck` / `rustfmt` /
# `cupcake` / `opa` / `command -v`, exactly as every line below does. The summary discovers the
# step list by reading this file back at exit, so an appended gate is classified automatically and
# a `\`-continued multi-line invocation counts once, at its first line. Comments between steps are
# free. The only way to write a step the summary cannot see is to indent it or to hide it inside a
# function or subshell -- so don't.
#
# Fail-fast is still available, as an explicit, justified exception -- never as the default for all
# ~190 steps. Use it only where a later check consumes this step's output, so continuing would
# produce verdicts that are not about anything. The live example is the `command -v cupcake` guard
# below: `|| { echo ...; exit 127; }`. Write that shape deliberately, with the reason next to it;
# the exit trap then reports everything after it as `NOT RUN` instead of letting it vanish.

# --- one suite, eleven stages ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# `bash scripts/check.sh` still runs everything. That has to stay true: every agent instruction,
# every git hook and every piece of documentation in this repo invokes this file by name and
# expects the whole verdict. What is new is how it gets there -- it runs its own stages as child
# processes and merges their results -- and that one stage can be run on its own:
#
#     bash scripts/check.sh --stage lint      one stage, in this process, no children
#     bash scripts/check.sh --jobs 1          every stage, one at a time
#     bash scripts/check.sh --list-stages     what the stages are and how many steps each holds
#
# The reason for stages is the reason the user gave for asking: "I would like to know when specific
# things fail faster, and it really just encapsulates too much." A formatting mistake used to be
# reported at the same distance from the push as a broken cross-compile, because both arrived in
# one summary after everything slow had finished.
#
# Which stage a step belongs to is decided by scripts/check-stages.py, from the fifth column of
# docs/ci-gate-portability.tsv -- one row per gate, already held in bijection with this file's step
# list by ci-gate-portability.py --check. `check-stages.py --check` is itself a step below, so a
# gate added here without a stage is red, and no stage list anywhere can fall behind this file. The
# same command emits the CI matrix, so a GitHub run page shows exactly these stages.

# --- who may run this, and how many at once -------------------------------------------------
# Both REFUSALS below are measurements, not policy preferences. On 2026-09-02 three subagents
# dispatched to do reverse engineering each ran ~72 minutes. The research was not the cost: the
# Ghidra MCP accounted for 51 calls totalling 59 seconds across one of them. What consumed the
# time was this file, run repeatedly, concurrently, by every one of them.
#
# 1. Agent WORKTREES. Each subagent works in its own .claude/worktrees/agent-<id> checkout with
#    its own target/, so nothing shares a build cache and each run is a cold compile of the 24
#    cargo gates below. Four overlapped on this 16-core box: load average 54.26, and a run that
#    costs minutes on a quiet tree was still unfinished at 19 minutes. Then, because that far
#    outruns the harness Bash timeout, each agent sleep-polled its own run -- 18x `sleep 118`
#    = 2003s for one, 60x `timeout 28 sleep 27` = 1330s for another. A poll costs a whole model
#    turn, not merely its sleep; one agent spent 33 of its 45 tool-minutes asleep.
#
#    A subagent does not need this file. It needs `cargo test -p <its crate>` plus the specific
#    scripts/<gate>.py its edit touches -- seconds, and an answer to the question it actually
#    has. The whole-workspace verdict is the orchestrator's, once, at integration.
#
# 2. CONCURRENCY, whoever the caller is. Two runs of this suite do not merely take twice as
#    long, they degrade each other's answer: the summary classifies steps as `INCONCLUSIVE`
#    (killed before a verdict) and `NOT RUN`, and a contended box manufactures both. A green from
#    a quiet tree is the only green that means anything, so a second concurrent run is refused
#    rather than queued -- queueing would just re-create the polling that caused this.
#
# Both refusals happen before the summary trap installs, so a refusal prints one line rather
# than a 234-row table of steps that never ran. Deliberate override: ER_CHECK_FORCE=1.

# `eldenring-deobf*.bin` -- which is every tree except a developer's, since both images are
# gitignored, game-derived and ~100 MB -- and fourteen gates printed one line saying their input
# was absent and exited 0, having asserted nothing whatever. Several say so in their own output:
# `SKIPPED (NOT A PASS) ... no field offset was checked at all`. The summary above still wrote
# `passed` beside every one of them. That is the same defect as `set -e` erasing 130 steps,
# arriving by a different road: a gate whose input was absent is indistinguishable from a gate
# that agreed with the tree.
#
# So a step whose input is missing is now skipped, out loud, with the missing input named -- and
# skipped is not a pass. `scripts/ci-gate-portability.py` owns the decision. It classifies every
# step against a measured ledger (docs/ci-gate-portability.tsv), keyed by the step's command text
# rather than its line number so the ledger survives edits to this file, and `--check` (wired in
# below) refuses a step that has no ledger row -- which is what stops the classification drifting
# the way .github/workflows/check.yml's hand-written step list did.

# A second source of skips, with the same honesty contract and the same machinery. The first
# asks "can this gate run HERE" (a missing game image); this one asks "can this diff have
# broken it". The user directive is blunt: neither CI nor a push should run the whole suite
# when the change does not require it -- a shell-script-only commit was compiling the entire
# workspace for ~14 minutes to prove nothing about itself.
#
# It is derived, never a second list. scripts/er-change-scope.py reads the step list back out
# of this file (through ci-gate-portability's parser, which reads this file's own
# `_check_step_pattern`) and reasons about each step's own `-p` packages against the reverse
# dependency closure of the diff -- the same walk scripts/er-dll-closure.py performs. So a
# cargo step added below is classified the moment it is written, with nothing to remember to
# update. That is the property the pre-push hook's deleted 13-gate list did not have, and one
# violation reached origin because of it (check-fnv1a-owner.py, PR #398).
#
# What it will never SKIP: anything that is not cargo-shaped. Every repo-wide invariant, every
# address-map and prologue gate, the portability ledger, shellcheck, the policy suites and
# `cargo fmt` run on every diff regardless -- they read the whole tree, so a scoped run cannot
# reason about them, and getting that boundary wrong is how a violation escapes.
#
# A skipped step is still a skipped STEP: it lands in the same skipped bucket, prints the same
# "this step did NOT run; that is not a pass" banner, and its reason begins `NOT SELECTED FOR`

# be skipped without touching any of the 226 step lines, without a second list of gate names,
# and without a per-gate opt-in that a new gate would forget. `command <name>` reaches the real
# program; the functions are not exported, so a gate that itself shells out to python3 is
# unaffected.
#
# `${BASH_LINENO[0]}` inside the shim is the line in this file that called it -- the same key the
# DEBUG trap records and the summary reads back -- which is why the skip can un-record a step the
# DEBUG trap has already counted as run. (DEBUG fires before the command, so without the unset a
# skipped step would appear in `steps run`.)
# Not this stage's step. Cheapest of the three tests and therefore first in every shim: a step
# another stage owns needs no ledger lookup and no `command -v`. The DEBUG trap has already
# recorded the line as run (it fires before the command), so un-record it here, exactly as
# _check_dep_skip does -- otherwise `steps run` would count steps this process never executed.

# where neither vendor/minhook nor the guard file exists. Preflight that refuses in that
# fixture would fail all sixteen of its cases for reasons unrelated to accumulation.
# That file was the pre-push hook's own 13-gate list while this file held 153, so a gate added
# here became push-invisible the moment it was written and CI was the first place it ever ran.
# One violation reached origin that way (check-fnv1a-owner.py, PR #398). The hook now runs this
# file, which makes the two sets the same set by construction rather than by anyone maintaining a
# list. Two things it carried had to survive the deletion, and they are both preambles, not gates.

# 1. MINHOOK, because a `git worktree` checkout starts without it. `vendor/` is gitignored, so an
#    agent sandbox under `.claude/worktrees/` or a `.worktrees/` lab has no MinHook while the main
#    checkout it was made from already does -- and this file is now what a push runs, so the first
#    thing such a worktree would otherwise learn is that its push is refused. The shared git dir
#    names that main checkout exactly, so link its vendor tree in rather than re-cloning ~1MB of C.
#    Fail closed and unchanged when the link cannot be made: a missing MinHook breaks the
#    cross-compile gates below, and a skipped cross-compile is not a pass.

# Reached only with no `--stage`, i.e. by every caller that has ever written `bash scripts/check.sh`
# -- the pre-push hook, AGENTS.md, every agent brief. They get the whole suite, as they always have.
# What changed is that it arrives as ten child processes and one merged verdict, which buys two
# things a single process could not:
#
#   1. A stage's verdict lands the moment that stage finishes, not when the slowest one does. The
#      lint stage answers in seconds; before this, its answer waited behind a cross-compile.
#   2. Stages overlap. The suite is mostly single-process python gates that leave fifteen of this
#      machine's sixteen cores idle while the one cargo stage is building.
#
# Why four. `ER_CHECK_JOBS` defaults to 4 here and `max-parallel: 4` says the same thing in
# .github/workflows/check.yml, because the user asked for one default in both places. Four rather
# than ten: scripts/lib/cpu-courtesy.sh already caps cargo at half this box (CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=8 of
# 16) so the machine stays usable, and a cargo stage running eight rustc processes alongside three
# python gates is already at that budget -- a fifth concurrent stage would take slices from the
# desktop, which is the exact regression cpu-courtesy exists to prevent. On CI the number is not
# about cores at all (each job gets its own runner) but about the caches: the two cargo stages
# restore a ~1 GB xwin CRT/SDK and a rust-cache, and ten simultaneous cold jobs would pull them ten
# times. Raise either with ER_CHECK_JOBS / max-parallel; they are one edit each.
#
# This function never returns. It is defined here, below the preamble marker, on purpose:
# scripts/test-check-sh-accumulates.py lifts everything above that marker and runs it over synthetic
# suites, and a fan-out lifted into that fixture would try to spawn the fixture's own stages.

# is single-SLOT: `er_game_base::log::begin_fresh_run` renames `<name>` to `<name>.prev` and
# truncates on the first write of each process, so two launches and run N-2 is gone -- and several
# sessions launch concurrently here, which makes that the normal case rather than a race. Measured
# 2026-08-31: an 11:09 launch destroyed the 09:07 run's 5.4 MB continue trace before anyone read
# it, and three artifacts keep zero generations because they are `fs::write`, not a rotating log.
# It ENUMERATES rather than pattern-matches -- it reads the knob table out of the Rust sources (the
# `env::var` call plus its resolver's own fallback, following `const` identifiers) and finds
# launchers by their actual launch command. That distinction is the point: pattern-matching is how
# this class hid.
#
# The live run passes while printing 98 known gaps across 13 launchers, held in
# `scripts/er-artifact-redirect-audit.baseline.txt`. Read that count as a to-do list, not an
# approval: the baseline records what is already broken, and only new drift fails. The count is
# printed on passing runs precisely so it cannot rot unseen. 1.2s each.
# Positive control: deleting one knob from `capture-er-frame.sh` (a launcher that currently
# redirects everything, so the gap is genuinely new) goes red naming the launcher, the knob and the
# consequence -- the baseline does not absorb it. Moving the same export line stays green.
#
# TRANSIENTLY red as of 2026-08-31, and deliberately left that way. Six knobs --
# ER_QUICKLOAD_{CPU_PROFILE,DIAG_HARNESS,INPUT_HARNESS_LOG,INPUT_HARNESS_PHASES,RELOAD_TRACE,
# TIMESERIES}_PATH -- appeared in the working tree while this gate was being wired. Measured with
# `git grep <knob> HEAD`: all six are absent at head, so they are another agent's uncommitted
# in-flight work, and that agent has already converted 6 of the 19 launchers. The remaining 13
# have not caught up, which is what the gate is reporting, correctly and for the first time.
#
# The fix is that agent finishing, not `--write-baseline`. Regenerating now would freeze somebody
# else's half-done change as ~78 rows of accepted debt and call it green -- which is the precise
# failure this whole sweep was called to undo. Leave it red until the launchers land; the suite
# accumulates failures rather than aborting, so a truthful red here costs a line in the summary
# and nothing else.
# RE-armed 2026-08-31, both lines, on the condition the note below asked for: the audit script, its
# baseline and the launcher changes are now all committed -- the launchers landed in 236b00ce and
# the script and baseline land with this re-arm. Measured against a detached worktree pinned to the

# or nearly reached the verified table, every one of them carrying `IDENTICAL` over 20-94
# instructions -- because a mid-function address verifies better than a real entry, sitting in a

# declarations, `include!` splices, `#[path]`, file-level `#![cfg(...)]` and the attributes on

# Every remaining host-TESTABLE crate, in two batches. Up to this line the crates above were

# `default-members = ["crates/er-quickload"]` means a bare `cargo test` selects one of 64
# crates, so a crate reaches a gate only by being named here. Nothing checked the naming was
# complete, and on 2026-08-31 an audit of all 64 found 20 more crates in exactly that state:
# 279 host-runnable test functions that had never executed once, in any gate, ever. The list
# is not exotic -- the storage-box refill hook, the inventory-sort defaults, the crash-logging
# core, the hotkey parser, the save-suppression core (31 tests), the TPF/FLVER/object codecs.
# All 279 passed the first time they ran, which is the good outcome and not the point: the
# point is that nothing would have said otherwise.
#
# Batched rather than one line per crate because a single cargo invocation resolves and builds
# them in parallel: measured 2.2s + 4.2s warm for the two batches, against ~20 separate
# invocations. scripts/check-test-target-coverage.py is what keeps the list complete from here.
#
# Batch 1 -- the game-adjacent shells and cores. Three of these (er-better-refills,
# er-inventory-sort, er-save-disable) did not compile for the host until the
# same day: a windows cdylib's items read as dead on Linux and `[workspace.lints.rust] warnings
# = "deny"` promotes that to a hard error, so `cargo test -p <crate>` failed outright. Fixed
# with the same crate-level `#![cfg_attr(not(windows), allow(dead_code, unused_imports))]` that
# er-save-suppress, er-seamless-bugfixes and er-armament-icons already carry.
# RE-armed 2026-09-01. Unwired on 2026-08-31 for a real reason -- er-inventory-sort's crate-level
# allow was in a working tree and in no commit, so the batch stopped at 24 deny-by-default
# dead-code errors -- and then left unwired after that lib.rs landed.
#
# `er-loading-bar` was a fourth member of both lists until b1117ce6 deleted the crate. cargo does
# not treat an unmatched `-p` as an empty selection -- it exits 101 with `package ID specification
# `er-loading-bar` did not match any packages` before compiling anything -- so the whole batch
# stopped running the moment the crate went away, and the line read as a test failure rather than
# as a name that no longer resolves.
#
# Measured 2026-09-14 after that removal: 647 tests across the fourteen crates below, all passing.
# The previous count here was 201 from 2026-09-01 and had been stale since well before the
# deletion -- er-npc-possess joined the line afterwards, and er-save-suppress alone now carries
# 406 of the total. A per-crate breakdown is deliberately not restated: it went out of date within

# test, so an uncommitted producer is invisible to it, which is the whole point. The selftest is
# two-sided: the two historical failures must go red and head must go green, because a gate
# wedged red is as useless as one wedged green.
# RE-armed and green: the E0533 that broke head while this file was being landed (`er_save_redirect::
# SaveSourceRejection::Unreadable` became a struct variant, its er-quickload and er-save-picker
# consumers landed still matching it as a unit variant) was fixed in 21ec2296. That was the third
# consumer-without-producer commit on this branch in one day, and it is why this line exists.
# scripts/hooks/pre-push runs the same script on every pushed tip; this catches it a commit earlier.

# ...and whether any of this runs on a commit at all. This clone's core.hooksPath was the
# absolute pre-rename path left behind by 39a919e0, so for a while no hook ran -- not the
# main-push guard, not this suite -- and nothing said so, because a hook git cannot find
# is indistinguishable from a hook that passed. That is this suite's own defect applied to the
# gates themselves. It asserts the value is set, that it resolves to a real directory holding an
# executable pre-push, and that it is RELATIVE: an absolute path is correct right up until the
# checkout is renamed, and then it is silently wrong.

# ...and whether the gate damages the checkout it is gating. It did, twice on 2026-08-31, from a
# push made in a linked worktree: git exports GIT_DIR to a linked worktree's hooks (but not to a
# main checkout's -- scripts/measure-git-hook-env.sh measures both, which is why this looked
# unreachable for a day), `git -C <fixture>` does not override it, and the fixture commands landed
# on the shared config -- core.bare = true, core.hooksPath gone, a push through the hole. The
# offending script now scrubs its environment; scripts/check-gate-config-guard.sh catches the
# class for this whole suite, and this proves it still fires in both directions.

# Dead/unused code in the save-disable DLL, on its shipping target. Scoped to that one

# whole job is to stop saves, and two dead helpers already survived a refactor unseen.
