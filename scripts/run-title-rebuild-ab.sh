# Runs the same-char switch reload TWICE with an IDENTICAL diagnostic set -- the decoupled read-side
# oracles (er-oracle-title-binding + er-oracle-stream-overlap, in er-telemetry) enabled in BOTH arms:
#   ARMED    = product autoload/own_load reload (MOD_ARMED=1, DRIVE_MODE=reload)
#   DISARMED = telemetry-only, harness-driven native reload (the run49 path; product feature off)
# Because the diagnostics are decoupled + identical in both arms, any delta between the two oracle
# streams is attributable to the PRODUCT FEATURE alone. The read: title-binding proxy_handle_nonnull
# True(disarmed) vs False(armed) pins the product hold that deadlocks the armed native Continue; the
# stream-overlap window is the dip mechanism in both arms.
#
# Crash logging is held default-on + CONSTANT in both arms (ER_QUICKLOAD_CRASH_LOG=1); RE-instrumentation
# markers are left ABSENT. No product-feature toggle differs except MOD_ARMED itself.
