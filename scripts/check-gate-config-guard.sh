# THE GATE MUST NOT DAMAGE THE THING IT GATES, AND ON 2026-08-31 IT DID -- TWICE.
#
# Route, end to end (bd hooks-selftest-under-git-hook-blanks-the-live-config-2026-08-31): a push
# FROM A LINKED WORKTREE runs the gate suite from its pre-push hook, and git exports GIT_DIR to a
# linked worktree's hooks -- measured on git 2.55 by scripts/measure-git-hook-env.sh, which also
# measures that a MAIN checkout's hooks get no GIT_DIR at all, which is why this looked unreachable
# for a day. `git -C <fixture>` does NOT override GIT_DIR, so every fixture command in a downstream
# gate lands on the SHARED config instead: `git init` saw a git dir not named `.git`, wrote
# core.bare = true, and every later `git status` in the main checkout died with "fatal: this
# operation must be run in a work tree"; `git config --unset core.hooksPath` disarmed the hooks for
# ninety minutes and a push reached origin ungated.
#
# scripts/check-git-hooks-installed.sh now scrubs its own environment, which closes the one gate
# that was caught. This closes the CLASS: any gate, today's or tomorrow's, that builds a git
# fixture without scrubbing gets caught here instead of in the next person's checkout.
#
# WHY A SOURCED FILE RATHER THAN LINES INSIDE check.sh: scripts/test-check-config-guard.sh drives
# this logic against fixture repositories, and it must drive the REAL text, not a copy that can
# drift. A file both of them read is the only shape where that is structurally true. It used to be
# the opening trap of scripts/ci-local-check.sh, which was deleted on 2026-09-03 when the pre-push
# hook moved to parity with CI (both now run scripts/check.sh).
#
# Scoped to the two keys the damage lands on, deliberately. Comparing the whole config file would
# go red on an unrelated `[branch]` write from another agent working in this tree, and a gate that
# cries wolf gets its check deleted. Read through an explicit --git-dir, which outranks an
# inherited GIT_DIR and keeps working after core.bare has already gone true -- the state in which
# most other git commands stop working.
#
# Usage (sourced, never executed):
#   source scripts/check-gate-config-guard.sh
#   gate_config_snapshot "$repo_root"      # before any gate runs
#   ... gates ...
#   gate_config_report || failed=$((failed + 1))   # returns 1 and prints when the config moved
