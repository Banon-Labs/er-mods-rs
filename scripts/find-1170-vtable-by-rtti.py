"""Locate a C++ vtable in either ELDEN RING image by its RTTI class name. Exact, not a vote.

WHY THE VOTE WAS NOT ENOUGH. `locate-1170-vtable.py` infers a vtable's new address from how many
of its slots hold already-mapped functions. That works until sibling classes enter the picture.
`RideManipulator`, `ComManipulator`, `PadManipulator` and `NetAIManipulator` all derive from
`ChrManipulator` and therefore SHARE most of their slots -- so a wrong sibling's vtable scores
almost as well as the right one. Measured on 1.16.2 `RideManipulator` (`0x142a2c108`): the top two
candidate bases TIED at 42 agreeing slots each. Picking the winner would have been a coin flip
dressed as evidence, and the loser was `0x142a2f118` -- the address a uniform `+0x3010` shift
predicts, which is exactly the kind of plausible-looking wrong answer this repo has been bitten by.

THE EXACT ANSWER. MSVC records the class name in the binary. Every polymorphic class has a
TypeDescriptor holding its decorated name (`.?AVRideManipulator@CS@@`); a Complete Object Locator
points at that descriptor; and the qword IMMEDIATELY BEFORE a vtable points at that locator. So
the chain runs name -> descriptor -> locator -> vtable with no similarity metric anywhere in it.
A hit is the class, by the compiler's own record.

    TypeDescriptor : +0x00 vftable* , +0x08 spare , +0x10 name (NUL-terminated)
    COL (x64)      : +0x00 signature(=1) , +0x04 offset , +0x08 cdOffset ,
                     +0x0c pTypeDescriptor(RVA) , +0x10 pClassDescriptor(RVA) , +0x14 pSelf(RVA)
    vtable         : COL qword sits at vtable-8

Both images are FLAT: file offset == RVA, VA = 0x140000000 + offset, `.rdata` included. That is
why an RVA can be compared against a file offset directly here.
