"""ONE definition of "which `.rs` files under this root are this repository's Rust source".

Six gates used to carry six hand-maintained copies of this directory list and six copies of the
walk that consumes it. They had already drifted: on 2026-08-31 `check-no-lossy-utf8.py` was the
only one whose list omitted `.claude`, so it read 14,284 `.rs` copies out of OTHER AGENTS'
worktrees -- 96.2% of the 14,855 files it looked at -- and a stray `String::from_utf8_lossy` in
any sibling agent's sandbox failed this repo's gate. Nobody noticed, because the only symptoms
were a slow gate and an occasional red from a directory nobody thinks of as part of the repo.
One shared definition is the fix for the drift; the per-gate `also_ignore` argument is how a
gate says "and this one too, for THIS reason" without forking the whole list again.

THE WALK PRUNES, IT DOES NOT POST-FILTER. `dirs[:] = ...` during `os.walk` yields exactly the
paths a post-filtered `root.rglob("*.rs")` kept -- a path under an ignored directory carries
that directory in its relative `.parts`, so the post-filter had already dropped it -- while
never READING the ignored subtree. Measured 2026-08-31: `rglob` traversed all 1,118,634 entries
under this repo root (`.worktrees` 564,630 + `.claude` 387,965 + `target` 159,386 = 99.4% of
them) to arrive at 571 real source files, and under load that walk took 28-69s.

NOT `git ls-files`. Measured and rejected for this family: the tracked set ADDS 20 tracked
`third_party/hudhook/*.rs` these gates deliberately exclude (they would go red on vendored
upstream code) and DROPS the untracked `crates/**/*.rs` that sibling agents have in flight (the
gates would stop seeing uncommitted work). The filesystem walk is the correct input here.
