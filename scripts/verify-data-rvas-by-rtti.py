"""Second-opinion the 1.16.2 -> 1.17 DATA map: RTTI identity, accessors, literals, code pointers.

WIRING -- ALREADY DONE, and deliberately not by adding a line. `scripts/check.sh` line 818 already
runs `verify-data-rvas-by-rtti.py --selftest`, and the anchor audit below runs INSIDE that
selftest: the tracked map must have zero DISAGREE, every verified row must survive two mutations,
the frozen negative must stay unverified, and the unanchored set must match `UNANCHORED` exactly.
So the enforcement landed without touching `check.sh`, which another agent has in flight.

`--anchors` is the same audit in a human-readable form and is not needed by CI. `--occupancy` and
`--population` are reporting modes.

WHAT WAS UNAUDITED, AND WHY IT MATTERED
---------------------------------------
Two separate audits of the 1.17 migration closed the CODE side -- 485 of 490 declared game
addresses callable, 92 detour sites all detour-safe -- and both ended on the same open sentence:
DATA addresses are checked by nothing. `getFunctionByAddress` has no opinion about a global, and
byte equality is worse than no opinion at all, because `.data` at rest is zeros in both builds and
zeros match. That is how `FIRST_SECTION_RVA` (0x1000, a PE section-boundary sanity bound, not an
address of anything) earned an `IDENTICAL-WHOLE` verdict: the bytes there really are identical.

The cost of the hole is measured, not hypothetical. Four singleton globals read garbage on 1.17 on
2026-08-31; `GameDataMan`'s stale address returned `0x6e614d6e6f697463`, little-endian ASCII
`"ctionMan"`, because 1.17 parks the RTTI name `.?AVNWSteamConnectionManager@DLNW3@@` there. Their
deltas were +0x4060, +0x4070, +0x4070 and +0x4080 -- and across the whole tracked map there are
FOURTEEN distinct deltas (seven in `.data` from +0x4010 to +0x4110, seven in `.rdata` from +0x3000
to +0x3160). A single constant is wrong on 46 of the 103 addresses even if you pick the modal one
per section, so nothing carries a data address forward by arithmetic.

THE FIVE ANCHORS, AND WHAT EACH ONE IS WORTH
---------------------------------------------
Every anchor below is content or evidence about the DESTINATION. None of them is "the bytes at the
two addresses are equal", and none of them reads the data map for its answer -- the map is only
what the answer is compared against.

  RTTI     A vtable's `[base-8]` CompleteObjectLocator names its class. A mangled name occurring
           exactly once per image identifies its vtable outright (PROVEN); a repeated name falls
           back to the ordinal (ORDINAL). Compiler metadata, no pairing, no pattern matching.

  ACCESSOR The code that READS the global. Every rip-relative reference in 1.16.2 `.text` gets a
           short window with its displacement blanked; a window that is unique in BOTH images
           identifies the same instruction on 1.17, and its displacement says where the global
           went. A neighbourhood that was edited simply stops matching and casts no vote, so an
           edit costs evidence instead of producing a wrong answer. Two agreeing accessors are a
           fact; ONE is a guess, and is reported as ACCESSOR-WEAK rather than counted.

           This is NOT the data map's own method. That one carries the referencing FUNCTION across
           with the function map and re-reads the same instruction, so every row it produces
           depends on the function map being right about that function. This depends on the
           function map not at all.

  LITERAL  For a string, the STRING -- the actual bytes at the target, NUL-terminated, ASCII or
           UTF-16. Unique per image is PROVEN; repeated falls back to the ordinal. `TextFadeOut`,
           `PressStart`, `TosTitle/Text` and `m60_42_34_00` occur exactly once in each build.

  FNPTR    For a table of code pointers, the pointers. Each slot's 1.16.2 target is looked up in
           the FUNCTION ledger and the paired 1.17 function must be the qword at the same slot of
           the destination. Two agreeing slots required, for the same reason as accessors.

  STRING-  LITERAL, one dereference out. For a datum whose qwords are `wchar_t*`, the strings
  PTR      those pointers REACH -- required to be the same literal, occurring exactly once in each
           image, at the source's pointee and the candidate's, with no slot disagreeing and the
           identical test failing at every +-0x8/+-0x10 neighbour. Added 2026-08-31, and it moved
           two of the four thinnest rows in the ledger out of UNANCHORED:
           `STEAM_ID_ACCESSOR_CALL_SLOT` (9 slots, "Resolution-WindowScreenWidth" and eight more,
           though see `string_ptr_identity` on WHOSE slots those are) and
           `PROFILE_OFFSCREEN_SIZE_TABLE` (3, "SYSTEX_Menu_Profile01"). Both had been carried by a
           bracket plus a single agreeing reference; neither is a vtable, neither has
           unique-enough accessors, and their pointers are data rather than code, so all four
           earlier anchors passed over them in silence.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* AN ANCHOR
-------------------------------------
Byte equality, a constant delta, and "the address is readable". All three pass on `FIRST_SECTION_RVA`
and on every zeroed `.data` slot in the image. The selftest plants `0x1000 -> 0x1000` as a frozen
negative and requires this tool to answer NO-ANCHOR: an over-broad matcher that verifies whatever it
is handed goes red there even though the row is, in the byte sense, perfectly "verified".

WHY THIS SECOND OPINION IS NOT A REPEAT
---------------------------------------
`map-data-rvas-1162-to-1170.py` carries a datum by the CODE that references it: it maps the
referencing function onto 1.17 and re-reads the displacement. Every row it produces therefore
depends on the function map being right about that one function. RTTI depends on none of that.
A vtable's `[base-8]` qword points at its CompleteObjectLocator, whose TypeDescriptor holds the
class's mangled name -- metadata the compiler emitted, present in both images, and read here
with no pairing, no signature matching and no shared input with the voting method.

So when both agree, two methods with disjoint failure modes agree. When they disagree, the
reference vote is wrong or the row is not a vtable, and either way it is worth a stop.

WHAT COUNTS AS PROOF, AND WHAT ONLY COUNTS AS CORROBORATION
-----------------------------------------------------------
A mangled name that occurs EXACTLY ONCE per image identifies its vtable outright: PROVEN.
ELDEN RING has plenty of names that occur several times (base subobject vtables, and 5,616 of
the 10,202 are `std::_Func_impl` / lambda functors whose names repeat). For those the name alone
is not an identity, so the check falls back to the ORDINAL: if the source is the k-th vtable
carrying that name in 1.16.2, the destination must be the k-th carrying it in 1.17. Both images
hold the same 10,202 vtables in the same relative order, so the ordinal is meaningful -- but it
is an ordering argument, not a unique key, so it is reported as ORDINAL rather than PROVEN.

A row whose source is not a vtable at all (a plain global, a table of pointers) is N/A here.
That is most of the map, and it is why this tool does not replace the voting one.

    """Verdict from the strings the table's POINTERS reach, or `None` when it holds none.

    WHY A HOP. `literal_identity` above asks what is AT the address, which answers for the four
    rows that are strings and for nothing else. A table of `wchar_t*` is one dereference away from
    the same evidence and was invisible to every anchor here: it is not a vtable (no RTTI), its
    accessors are not unique enough to vote, and its pointers are data rather than code so the
    function map cannot pair them.

    That was not a small gap. `STEAM_ID_ACCESSOR_CALL_SLOT_RVA` and
    `PROFILE_OFFSCREEN_SIZE_TABLE_RVA` are two of the four thinnest addresses in the ledger --
    carried by a bracket alone, with a single agreeing reference each -- and both sit in front of
    `wchar_t*` slots reaching strings that occur
    EXACTLY ONCE per image: "Resolution-WindowScreenWidth" and "Resolution-WindowScreenHeight" for
    the first, "SYSTEX_Menu_Profile01" for the second, each at the source's pointee in 1.16.2 and
    at the candidate's pointee in 1.17. A name that occurs once per image is the same class of
    evidence the RTTI anchor rests on, and it owes nothing to a delta, to a neighbour, or to the
    reference that carried the row into the map.

    The bar is deliberately strict, because ONE slot is enough to promote a row here and a wrong
    table would be promoted just as confidently as a right one:
      * the slot's pointee must be a literal in BOTH images and the SAME literal;
      * that literal must occur exactly once in each image -- an ordinal fallback is not offered,
        because a repeated string reached through a pointer says nothing about which table holds
        the pointer;
      * no slot may disagree -- one mismatched slot returns DISAGREE, which is what catches a
        destination nudged by eight bytes: the slots shift by one and the strings stop lining up;
      * and the identical test must FAIL at every +-0x8/+-0x10 neighbour, so the verdict identifies
        an address rather than a neighbourhood.

    THE WINDOW IS TWELVE QWORDS AND THE OBJECT MAY BE SHORTER, which is worth saying plainly, and
    on this row it is not a hypothetical: `STEAM_ID_ACCESSOR_CALL_SLOT_RVA` (renamed 2026-08-31
    from `STEAM_INTERFACE_GUARD_RVA`) is ONE qword, an indirect-call slot with exactly one
    reference in the image. The nine slots that carry it here are a graphics-settings key table --
    "Resolution-WindowScreenWidth" through "EffectsQuality" -- that begins at +0x10, after a
    `0x8000000a00000000` filler at +0x8, and belongs to a different object entirely. That does not
    weaken the claim, because the claim being made is about the POSITION -- the 96 bytes at the
    candidate hold pointers to the same nine unique strings, in the same order, as at the source --
    and the neighbour test above is what stops that from degenerating into "somewhere around here".

    """Verdict from the call sites that dispatch through the table's slots, or `None`.

    WHY `.pdata` ABSENCE IS NOT FUNCTION ABSENCE, and why that left a hole here. `fnptr_identity`
    above pairs a table's code pointers through the FUNCTION ledger, which is built from `.pdata`.
    `.pdata` declares only functions with unwind data: it is blind to leaves, and measurably so --
    it covers 235,848 entries against the 367,183 functions Ghidra's own analysis finds in 1.16.2
    (366,673 in 1.17). `MENU_PUMP_KICK_PTR_RVA` falls straight into that gap. Its two slots hold
    `0x1409b3ff0` and `0x1409b3fe0`, each a five-byte `E9 rel32` thunk into Arxan rubble, neither
    in either image's `.pdata` and therefore neither in the 128,602-row ledger -- so FNPTR looked
    at the one row it was most needed for and returned `None`.

    Ghidra sees both. `getFunctionByAddress` answers `thunk_FUN_1458f4ac8` at `0x1409b3ff0` and
    `thunk_FUN_1405b2d8e` at `0x1409b3fe0` in 1.16.2, and a five-byte thunk at `0x1409b5240` and
    `0x1409b5230` in 1.17; each has exactly ONE caller, and the callers are `FUN_1409b24e0` and
    `FUN_1409b3730` -- a pair the function ledger already carries, both 2043 bytes, 28 callees,
    4 callers. The two dispatch sites sit at the SAME body-relative offsets in each, `+0xdb` and
    `+0x780`.

    But the thunk itself cannot be the evidence, and that is worth saying rather than glossing:
    `getXrefsTo` returns exactly two references to each of the four, the table slot and the
    computed call THROUGH that slot. A thunk reachable only from the table has no identity apart
    from the table, so pairing it by its own content or its own callers would be reading the
    answer out of the question. Following its `jmp` does not help either -- the Arxan gadget chain
    behind it is regenerated per build (1.16.2 spills `r14` where 1.17 spills `rcx`, and ends on
    `xchg` where 1.17 ends on `push/pop`), so there is no byte or mnemonic comparison to make.

    So this anchor reads the SITES instead, one per slot, with the accessor machinery:
      * a slot counts only when BOTH images hold a first-`.text` address in it, which is what
        makes it a code-pointer table rather than a neighbouring global that moved the same way.
        Bracketing is not an anchor in this file and this must not become one by accident, and the
        gate is what stops it becoming one: WITHOUT it the same two-site rule fires on 54 of the
        116 rows, with it on 8. The 46 it drops are brackets wearing this anchor's clothes --
        `DLUID_SINGLETON_RVA` would have been "corroborated" by the site reading its `+0x8`, which
        is `FD4_PAD_MANAGER_RVA`, a different global that happens to have moved the same distance;
      * that slot's rip-relative reference must have a displacement-blanked 24-byte window
        occurring exactly ONCE in each image -- the accessor test, unchanged -- and its 1.17
        displacement must land exactly on `dst + offset`;
      * two such slots are required, and ONE disagreeing slot returns DISAGREE;
      * and the whole test must fail at every +-0x8/+-0x10 neighbour.

    What that buys over `ACCESSOR-WEAK` is the second instruction. `MENU_PUMP_KICK_PTR_RVA` has a
    single reference to its base, which is why the accessor anchor calls it a guess; the reference
    to `+0x8` is a DIFFERENT instruction, 0x6a5 bytes away in the same function, identified by its
    own unique window, and it lands eight bytes further along. Two independently identified
    instructions dispatching through `dst+0` and `dst+8` is a positional claim about the table
    that no single reference can make.

    Of the 8 rows it has an opinion about, 7 are vtables the RTTI anchor reaches first, and on all
    7 it AGREES -- so the one row it actually promotes arrives with the rule already exercised
    against seven independently-decided answers. Measured against the controls the STRING-PTR
    precedent set: `dst+-0x8` returns DISAGREE, `dst+-0x10` and `+-0x18` return `None`, dst reverted
    to the 1.16.2 address returns `None`, another row's address returns `None`, and the frozen
    negative returns `None`.

# The 17 rows this file's anchors do NOT reach, pinned by name so the set can only shrink.
#
# It is a list rather than a count so a row LEAVING it (someone found evidence) and a row ENTERING
# it (someone lost evidence) are different diffs. The data map still carries every one of them on
# its own method; what is recorded here is that the independent anchors above do not corroborate
# them, which is a different and much weaker statement than "verified".
#
# Two shapes, and the distinction is the reason the set is not one bucket:
#
#   NO-ANCHOR (10) -- zeroed `.data` at rest in BOTH images, reached only from code 1.17 edited
#   around, so no window is unique on both sides. There is nothing to read and nothing to vote
#   with. `FIRST_SECTION_RVA` is what pretending otherwise looks like.
#
#   ACCESSOR-WEAK (7) -- exactly ONE reference site survives the uniqueness test, and it agrees
#   with the map. That is corroboration, not proof: one reference inside a function that happens to
#   have been edited is how a confident wrong address is produced, so it is counted with the
#   unverified.
#
# `NAV_COST_TABLE_RVA` is the one to read before trying to shrink this set again, because it is
# where every anchor above genuinely runs out rather than merely not applying. It is 0x400 bytes of
# ZEROS in both images with no non-zero qword within +-0x200, so there is no content, no pointer
# and no neighbour to read. Its three reference sites survive uniqueness in 1.16.2 and match
# NOTHING in 1.17, and the reason is visible in the bytes: at 0x2ec3a2 the 24-byte window differs
# from its 1.17 counterpart at 0x2ec3b2 in exactly two places, both rip-relative displacements of
# OTHER instructions in the window. Masking every operand in the window rather than only the one
# being read -- the treatment `map-rvas-1162-to-1170.py` gives a function signature -- was measured
# on it: it rescues ONE of the three sites and leaves the other two at nine-plus matches and zero
# matches respectively, so the row still falls short of two and the change would have loosened the
# anchor that carries 58 rows for nothing. So NAV_COST is unanchorable HERE by every method tried,
# not merely by the one; it is carried by the data map on a bracket and that is all it has.
#
# AN ENTRY IS A CONSTANT NAME, OR AN ADDRESS WHERE THERE IS NO NAME. Four rows in the data map are
# addresses the workspace writes as BARE HEX LITERALS handed to `game_rva`, with no constant
# anywhere, so the map keys them `<file>:<line>` -- a string that changes every time somebody edits
# a line above them. Pinning one of those by "name" would pin a line number into a gate and fail on
# the next unrelated edit to the menu tracer. `pin_of` therefore uses the constant when the row has
# one and the source address when it does not; an address is a strictly more stable pin, and the
# set still only shrinks.
