"""Hardware WRITE watchpoint on a field of a LIVE Wine/Proton `eldenring.exe`.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`scripts/er-live-fields.py` answers "what is this field NOW" by reading /proc/<pid>/mem.
It cannot answer "WHICH INSTRUCTION wrote it", and neither can an in-process function hook
when the writer set has already been enumerated byte-complete and every member was silent
at the moment of interest (bd `savestate-writer-set-complete-and-silent-at-the-wedge-2026-08-31`).
The remaining instrument is a data watchpoint, and AGENTS.md names exactly one sanctioned
transport for a Wine target: the `linux-x86-debug` toolkit's `winedbg --gdb` attach.
NEVER `frida.attach()` here -- it segfaults inside eldenring.exe and kills the game.

WHY `--no-start` RATHER THAN THE TOOLKIT'S `tracebreakpoint`
-----------------------------------------------------------
`tracebreakpoint` only emits `break *<addr>` (a CODE breakpoint). The question here is a DATA
write to an address that is not known to be written by any code we can name, so the tool's
own gdb-script builder cannot express it. This drives the SAME transport with a different
script: `winedbg --gdb --no-start --port N <windows-pid>` opens a gdb stub on localhost and
a HOST gdb connects to it. Two things fall out of that split, both of which matter here:

  * gdb does not have to exist inside the Steam Linux Runtime container (it does not), and
  * the host's own gdb (with `watch`) drives the session.

MEASURED CONTAINER FACTS (2026-08-31, Proton Experimental + SteamLinuxRuntime_4)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * mount namespace is NOT shared with the host, but the PID and NET namespaces ARE.
    So localhost TCP crosses the boundary and `--port` works.
  * the prefix's wineserver socket is `/tmp/.wine-<uid>/server-<dev>-<ino>/socket`, derived
    from the WINEPREFIX directory's st_dev/st_ino, and the host CAN see it: /tmp is shared.
    That is what lets a host-launched Proton `wine` join the running prefix.
  * the game image is at 0x140000000 (WINEPRELOADRESERVE=140000000-145e0a000), so a 1.17
    deobf VA needs no runtime translation.

The Wine WINDOWS pid (what `winedbg --gdb` wants -- not the unix pid) is printed by me3 as
`attaching to process pid=<N>` in its launch log; `--me3-log` parses it.

POSITIVE CONTROL, ALWAYS
------------------------
A watchpoint that silently fails to arm looks exactly like a field nobody writes. Hardware
data breakpoints are known to be silently dropped on some Wine configurations here (bd
`wine-proton-no-hardware-data-breakpoints-2026`: DR0/DR7 set through SetThreadContext on 85
threads, zero traps, while the field provably changed). So this refuses to report "no writer"
on its own: it records whether gdb called the watchpoint HARDWARE, and the caller must
compare the hit count against an independent in-process count of writes over the same window.

Usage:
    scripts/er-winedbg-watchpoint.py --mode probe  --out DIR      # arm, report, detach
    scripts/er-winedbg-watchpoint.py --mode arm --out DIR --deadline-seconds 200
    scripts/er-winedbg-watchpoint.py --selftest                   # no game needed
