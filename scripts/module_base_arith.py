"""Is this `<module base> + <something>` a compiled-in 1.16.2 address used raw on 1.17?

ONE DIALECT, NOT TWO. `scripts/check-oracle-singleton-globals.py` and
`scripts/check-stale-rva-calls.py` both answer that question, and until 2026-08-31 they answered
it with two different vocabularies -- which is how 29 sites ended up owned by neither.

    THE SEAM, measured rather than asserted. The pair was repeatedly described as a partition:
    `check-stale-rva-calls.py` owns `base + NAMED_CONSTANT`, the singleton gate owns every other
    right-hand side. It was not a partition. The sibling recognised a named constant only inside
    `transmute(...)`, `safe_read_*(...)` or a comparison, and the singleton gate had already
    handed the site away on seeing an uppercase right-hand side. Anywhere else -- inside a
    `format_args!`, as an element of a hook-install table, as a bare `let` -- BOTH gates were
    silent, and `check-stale-rva-calls.py` reported `0 known ungated site(s)` throughout.

    The consequence was mostly log lines naming a 1.16.2 address on the one branch whose entire
    subject is that addresses moved: `title_scaleform_msgbox.rs:361` printed
    `base + POLICY_TOS_TITLE_CTOR_RVA` directly above a correctly resolved `game_data_addr` call
    inside the SAME `format_args!`, so the line named an address the code never touched.

So the shared vocabulary lives here, and both gates import it. A widening or a fix to any of
these decisions now lands in both at once, which is the whole point -- the alternative is two
copies that agree today and drift by the next migration.

WHAT IS SHARED, and what each decision is FOR:

  `is_module_base`      Is the identifier the GAME module base? Decided from the BINDING, never
                        from the name -- `er-crash-logging-core/src/hang.rs` calls a heap
                        `CS::LoadingScreenData` pointer `base`, `er-invasion-warp`'s is
                        `ersc.dll`'s, and `er-save-loader/src/profile_summary.rs`'s is a byte
                        offset into a save record. All three are `base + SOMETHING` and none of
                        them has a version to be wrong about.
  `is_resolver_fed`     Does the sum reach an API that performs the 1.16.2 -> 1.17 resolve
                        itself? Handing `base + rva` to `MhHook::new`, `register_shared_hook` or
                        `resolve_game_address` is the DOCUMENTED shape; resolving first is the
                        double-translate bug that `scripts/check-double-resolved-hook-targets.py`
                        exists for.
  the VALUE bounds      A constant below `.text` is a PE-header field and cannot move; one at or
                        above the image span is an EXTENT (`a < base + MODULE_SPAN`), not an
                        address in it. Both are excluded by VALUE, never by name -- and a
                        constant that cannot be resolved is KEPT, so "I could not read it" is
                        never spelled the same way as "I read it and it is safe".
