"""Clear (or convict) a struct field offset PER NAMED OBJECT, per base register.

THE RULE THIS TOOL EXISTS TO OBEY
---------------------------------
A field offset is a number, and the same number is a field in dozens of unrelated structures.
`0x50`, `0x88`, `0x90`, `0xb8`, `0xd4` and `0xe0` are the repo's commonest small offsets, and one
Wwise init function that shifted its settings block by a uniform +0x38 in 1.17 "moves" all six at
once. Joining a repo constant to a drift row on the NUMBER therefore proves nothing, in either
direction: it neither convicts nor clears. Two discriminators built on 2026-08-30 did exactly
that -- "a hooked function reads that number" cleared 484 of 553 constants and anonymous
bracketing cleared all 48 -- and both had to be retracted.

A clearance is valid only when all three of these hold at once:
  * the OBJECT is named, and the same object is identified in BOTH images independently;
  * the witness instruction reaches the field through a base register that provably holds a
    pointer to THAT object (`this`), not through some other pointer the same function walks;
  * the two function bodies are otherwise instruction-for-instruction identical, so a
    displacement that did not change did not change because the code did not change.

WHERE THE OBJECT IDENTITY COMES FROM
------------------------------------
MSVC RTTI. `vtable[-1]` is a CompleteObjectLocator, `COL+0x0c` a TypeDescriptor, `+0x10` its
mangled class name -- FromSoft's own metadata, embedded in each image separately. So finding
`.?AVMoveMapStep@CS@@` in 1.16.2 and again in 1.17 pairs the two vtables WITHOUT consulting the
content-matched function map at all. Two consequences that matter here:

  ROUTE A (virtual methods).  Vtable slot N is the same virtual method of the same class in both
      images, so slot N pairs two functions by OBJECT IDENTITY. This works for LEAF functions,
      which MSVC gives no `.pdata` record and which the content map therefore cannot contain.
      In every such method `this` arrives in `rcx` by the x64 calling convention.

  ROUTE B (constructors and other vtable users).  A function that stores the class's vtable into
      `[reg]` is constructing that object, and `reg` is `this`. Its 1.17 counterpart is taken
      from the function map -- but is then INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED: the paired body must store
      the 1.17 vtable of the SAME class at the corresponding instruction. A map pairing that
      happens to be wrong cannot satisfy that, because it would be storing some other class's
      vtable. Constructors touch many fields at once, so this is where the coverage is.

WHICH REGISTER HOLDS `this`
---------------------------
Tracked, not assumed. `rcx` at entry; a `mov r64, <alias>` in the PROLOGUE (before the first
control-flow instruction, which is where MSVC parks `this` in a nonvolatile register) extends the
alias set; any write to a register removes it, and a `call` removes every volatile. Extending the
set is deliberately confined to the prologue: past the first branch a linear walk can pick up an
assignment from a path that does not reach the use, and a wrong alias is a wrong clearance. The
cost is coverage, which is the right way round -- a missed field is a lookup, a wrongly cleared
one is a write into a member the mod does not own.

VERDICTS
--------
  CLEARED       the offset was read/written through `this` in >=1 otherwise-identical method pair
                of this class, and the displacement is the same in 1.17.
  MOVED         the same, but the displacement changed. Old, new, and the witness are printed.
  UNKNOWN       no witness. NOT a clearance. Printed with the reason (no paired method touches
                it / every method that does has a changed body).

USAGE
    --selftest
    --class CS::MoveMapStep [--offsets 0x4b8,0x50] [--routes ab]
    --classes-from FILE        one `class [= offset,offset]` per line. The separator is `=`,
                               NOT `:` -- a class name is full of colons. A line written with
                               `:` parses as one long class name, and every row then reports
                               `NO RTTI / class-not-in-rtti-join`, which reads exactly like
                               "this class does not exist in the images" (measured 2026-08-31,
                               18 classes silently reported as absent when all 18 were present).
