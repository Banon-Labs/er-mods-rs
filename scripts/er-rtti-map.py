"""Recover MSVC RTTI class names -> vtable addresses from a flat ELDEN RING image.

Why this exists. The Ghidra dump served on :8767 is the installed build (1.17) and has zero class
names -- `searchFunctionsByName` answers 0 for GridControl, MenuWindow and CSMenuMan alike -- so
every name-driven lookup has had to detour through the 1.16.2 dump on :8765 and then translate the
address back. That detour is the single reason anything in this repo still references 1.16.2, and it
is avoidable: the RTTI is present in the 1.17 image (`.?AVGridControl@CS@@` sits at 0x143c93728),
it was simply never parsed, because `scripts/ghidra/import-runtime-gzf.sh` imports with
`-noanalysis` on the reasoning that a .gzf carries its own analysis. That reasoning held for the
curated 1.16.2 export and does not hold for this file.

Parsing it here rather than re-running Ghidra's analyzer is a minutes-vs-hours choice on a 94 MB
image, and it produces exactly the artifact the lookups need: a name -> vtable table for the build
that is actually running, with no cross-version translation in the path.

Layout (x64 MSVC), which is why the walk is three passes:
  TypeDescriptor      { void* pVFTable; void* spare; char name[]; }   name at +0x10
  CompleteObjectLocator { u32 signature; u32 offset; u32 cdOffset;
                          u32 pTypeDescriptor_rva; u32 pClassDescriptor_rva; u32 pSelf_rva; }
  vtable              [ COL* ][ vfunc0 ][ vfunc1 ] ...   -- the COL pointer sits at vtable-8

`pSelf_rva` is what makes this reliable: a genuine COL stores its own RVA, so a candidate that
points at itself is a COL and a coincidence is not. Signature 1 (x64) is checked too.
