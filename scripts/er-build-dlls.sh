# Build named ME3 shells AND record what they were built from.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A BARE CARGO CALL
# ---------------------------------------------
# `cargo xwin build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` honours
#     default-members = ["crates/er-quickload"]
# so it builds ONLY the product and exits 0 in a fraction of a second having compiled none of
# the other fifteen shells. That is indistinguishable from a successful incremental build,
# and the stale DLL from last week stays exactly where it was. So every package is named with
# an explicit `-p`, taken from scripts/me3-dll-list.py (the single source of truth for which
# cdylibs this workspace ships, including the four whose artifact name is NOT the package name
# with dashes swapped for underscores).
#
# Provenance is written HERE because it cannot be reconstructed afterwards: proving a DLL came
# from a given source tree needs a content hash taken while that tree was the one being
# compiled. scripts/er-run-branch.py refuses to launch an artifact without it.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/er-build-dlls.sh er-quickload er-armament-icons     # named packages
#   scripts/er-build-dlls.sh --all                               # every shipped shell
#   scripts/er-build-dlls.sh --closure closure.json              # packages from a closure
#
# A cold cross-compile takes minutes -- run this detached, not in a foreground shell.
