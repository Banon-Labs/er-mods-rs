"""Sync the built game DLLs to the ~/Elden/main staging dir and regenerate its manifest.

Copies every game-loadable DLL from target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/ into
ELDEN_MAIN_DIR (default ~/Elden/main) and rewrites dll-deploy-manifest.json with
per-DLL sha256/size plus the repo HEAD. Fails closed if any expected DLL is missing
from the build output (run the release build first).

Usage: python3 scripts/sync-dlls-to-elden-main.py [--dry-run] [--help]
Env:   ELDEN_MAIN_DIR, ER_MODS_REPO_ROOT override the defaults.

An unrecognised argument is an ERROR, not a silent full deploy: this script had no argument
parsing at all, so `--help` copied ten DLLs and rewrote the manifest instead of printing usage.
A deploy is a side effect that must be asked for explicitly.

    partial-update that `default-members` produces at build time, repeated at deploy

    evidence describes code that is not under test, which is indistinguishable from the
