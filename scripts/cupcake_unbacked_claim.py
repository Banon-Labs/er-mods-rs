"""Detect a closing message that CLAIMS a repo artifact was built when the turn wrote no file.

Sibling of the unexecuted-promise scan: that one catches "I'll build it" ending in nothing, this
one catches "I built it" when nothing was built. See
.cupcake/signals/last_assistant_unbacked_claim.sh for the incident that forced it.

Kept as an importable module rather than inline heredoc so it is unit-testable without a live
transcript -- the sibling guard's logic lives in cupcake_turn_scan.py for the same reason.
