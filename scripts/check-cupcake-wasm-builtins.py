"""Every Rego builtin our policies use must survive Cupcake's WASM runtime.

WHY THIS GATE EXISTS (2026-08-22). Every Stop-event guard in this repo was inert for 36 days and
nothing noticed, because a policy that cannot execute does not fail -- it returns nothing, and
"nothing" is indistinguishable from "clean turn".

The mechanism: `cupcake eval` does NOT run policies in the OPA interpreter. It shells out to
`opa build -t wasm` and executes the compiled module in its own embedded WASM runtime. OPA's WASM
target implements many builtins inside the module, but the rest are compiled as *host-dispatched*
calls -- the module emits the builtin's NAME into a dispatch table and calls back out, and the
embedding host must supply an implementation. `sprintf` is host-dispatched, and cupcake 0.5.2 does
not implement it (the string `sprintf` does not appear anywhere in the cupcake binary). A missing
host builtin does not raise: the call yields UNDEFINED, undefined propagates up through the rule
body, the decision set comes back empty, and cupcake logs "Synthesized ALLOW decision (no policies
triggered)" with exit code 0.

That is why the failure sorted itself by event type and looked like a routing bug. It never was:
    * PreToolUse guards build their reason strings with `concat` or plain literals -> they worked.
    * every Stop guard interpolated a captured signal phrase with `sprintf`  -> all silently dead.
The `walk()` aggregation in .cupcake/system/evaluate.rego was never at fault and is proven fine.

WHAT THIS GATE DOES. It refuses to take any builtin on trust:
  1. it extracts every builtin actually called by .cupcake/policies/** and .cupcake/system/**
     (comments and string literals stripped, so prose mentioning a name is not a call);
  2. every such builtin must have a PROBE recipe below. A builtin with no recipe is a HARD FAILURE,
     not a pass -- that is the anti-rot property: a new policy reaching for an unverified builtin
     breaks this gate until someone adds a probe and the probe passes;
  3. it then generates one throwaway halt policy per builtin, aggregates them through the repo's own
     evaluate.rego, and runs the REAL `cupcake eval` binary. A builtin whose halt does not come back
     is one the WASM runtime cannot execute, and the gate names it.

Step 3 is the load-bearing half. A hand-maintained blocklist of known-bad builtins would have to be
correct in advance about a runtime nobody here controls; this executes the runtime and asks it.

Run with --selftest to prove the detector still catches the original defect.
