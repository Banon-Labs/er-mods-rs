# recorded so the next reader does not have to guess either.

# `opa test` over the four orphaned suites, measured 2026-08-31 on a box at loadavg ~9:
# 0.113s / 0.013s / 0.010s / 0.008s. Ten seconds is ~90x the slowest, and matches the value
# check-no-timeouts.py already uses for its own fast `git ls-files` call.

# WHY THIS FILE NO LONGER SHELLS OUT TO test-cupcake-delivered-shape.py (2026-08-31).
# It used to, and its docstring said why: "adding a line to check.sh was out of scope" for the
# agent who wrote it. check.sh has carried those two lines at 421/422 since, so the gate ran
# TWICE per suite -- ~13.5s of the two runs (0.66s --selftest + 11.5-12.9s live, measured at
# loadavg ~9) duplicated for nothing. That duplication is also what pushed THIS script to 34.5s,
# past the 30s per-command cap, where a foreground call is SIGKILLed and reads as a hang.
# Removing it here leaves it a first-class enumerated step in check.sh, which times it, attributes
# its failure to it by name, and classifies a kill as INCONCLUSIVE rather than burying it in an
# AssertionError raised by an unrelated runner.
#
# COVERAGE, checked rather than assumed: when this call was removed, neither
# `.github/workflows/check.yml` nor `scripts/ci-local-check.sh` ran check.sh, so simply deleting
# it would have silently dropped delivered-shape coverage from CI. Both were given the gate
# directly instead, in both its forms -- `--selftest` (proves it rejects a fictional fixture) and
# live (the real contract) are not the same run and neither substitutes for the other.
# check.yml has since been changed to run check.sh itself, and its hand-copied gate steps -- these
# two among them -- were removed with it, because a hand-copied subset is what let ~215 gates go
# unrun in CI in the first place. ci-local-check.sh still does not run check.sh, so its copy is
# still the only delivered-shape coverage there and must stay.

# Assembled rather than written whole, so this FILE is not itself denied by the
# guard it tests when an agent edits it through a Bash command.

# THIS GATE DOES NOT RELIABLY FIT IN A 30-SECOND FOREGROUND SHELL. RUN IT IN THE BACKGROUND.
#
# Not a caveat -- a measurement. The work is 176 `cupcake eval` spawns costing ~237 CPU-seconds in
# total, and `cupcake eval` takes ONE event on stdin per process (checked against `--help`: there is
# no batch or server mode), so that CPU cost is a floor, not an inefficiency. Wall clock is therefore
# just that floor divided by however many cores the rest of the box leaves free, and on a machine six
# agents share that is not a quantity this script controls. Three runs of THIS code, same day, same
# tree: 20.4s at 1071% CPU, 23.4s at 1071%, 35.0s at 731%.
#
# An agent that runs this in a capped foreground shell gets SIGKILLed at 30 seconds, which is
# indistinguishable from a hang -- and the conclusion an agent then draws ("the gate is broken", or
# worse, "the policies are broken") is wrong in the dangerous direction. check.sh classifies such a
# kill as INCONCLUSIVE rather than a pass for exactly this reason.
#
# So the requirement announces ITSELF, on stdout, flushed, before any work starts: an agent that is
# about to be killed has already been told why. Being killed after reading this line is a correctly
# reported environment limit; being killed without it is a mystery each agent has to re-solve.
