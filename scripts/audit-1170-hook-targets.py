"""Audit the translated 1.17 detour targets OFFLINE, before any of them is installed.

`scripts/verify-rva-map-1170.py` answers "is the code at the mapped address the same function?".
This answers three questions it never asks, each of which corrupts the process rather than
faulting cleanly, and none of which needs the game to run:

  ENTRY     is the 1.17 target a FUNCTION ENTRY, or did the signature re-occur mid-function?
            A mapper finds where bytes recur; an inlined copy of a prologue is a perfectly good
            match and a perfectly fatal detour. Evidence is FORWARD-derived: `call`/`jmp rel32`
            instructions elsewhere in the image whose computed destination is exactly this
            address, plus absolute 8-byte pointers to it (vtable slots, jump tables), plus the
            image's own `.pdata` -- which both DECLARES entries and, by declaring none that
            CONTAINS the address, identifies an unwindless leaf. Those last two are different
            answers and reading them as one flagged good leaf targets as mid-function.
            An earlier version of this check decoded BACKWARDS from the address looking for
            padding or a terminator, and was deleted: run against the 1.16.2 image at the 27
            addresses this project has hooked successfully for months, it called 20 of them
            mid-function. Backward decoding desynchronises, and a de-Arxan'd image does not
            carry the int3 padding the check assumed. A test that fails on known-good input is
            not a strict test, it is a broken one.
  PATCH     do the whole instructions MinHook must relocate fit, and does anything jump INTO the
            five bytes it overwrites? A short jump landing inside the patch returns into a JMP's
            operand bytes -- an execute-fault into an address in no module, with no unwind.
  OVERLAP   do two targets land within 16 bytes of each other? The second MH_CreateHook then
            reads a prologue the first one has already replaced with a JMP, and trampolines it.

      2. The image's own `.pdata` DECLARES a function to start there. This is the authority, not a

    function" has two causes with opposite fixes:

      * the CHECK is wrong -- `.pdata` merged a tail, or declared an extent covering a second
        real entry, so a perfectly good target reads as interior. That is not hypothetical: the
        ENTRY check this file replaced called 20 of the project's 27 known-good hook targets
        mid-function, and a boundary source can be wrong the same way again; or
      * the DATA is wrong -- somebody put an address in a detour ledger that is not a function.

    Decoding forward from the declared start separates them, because an address that is not on an
    instruction boundary CANNOT be a function entry in any build, under any boundary source, no
    matter how wrong `.pdata` is. There is nothing to argue about and nothing to loosen: MinHook

    WITHOUT THIS THE BRANCH SCAN READS THE NEXT FUNCTION, AND NOT EVEN IN PHASE. `patch_safe`
    used to decode a flat `BRANCH_SCAN_BYTES` from the entry, which for a 14-byte leaf is 0x3f2
    bytes of somebody else's code entered at an arbitrary offset. The de-Arxan'd images make that
    worse than a plain over-read: the gaps between functions hold the deobfuscator's LEFTOVER
    BYTES rather than a uniform `cc`/`90` run, so the decode desynchronises on the way out and
    manufactures instructions that were never assembled -- including branches.

    Measured, and the whole reason this exists (2026-08-31). 1.16.2 `0x14067ac90`
    (`GameMan::SetSaveState`: `mov rax,[rip+0x36eec81] / mov [rax+0xb80],ecx / ret`, 14 bytes) is

    0x14067aca3 -- a branch into the patch operand, conjured out of two bytes of padding -- and
    the gate went red on a row four independent derivations had just confirmed. Its 1.17
    counterpart `0x14067bae0` is the same fourteen bytes; its junk pad byte happens to be `28`
    instead of `83`, so it desynchronised into a harmless `sub` and that side stayed green. Which
    image a correct row failed on was decided by one leftover byte.

    Measured over the 425 rows both detour ledgers admit: 359 declared, 0 enclosed, 66 decoded
    leaves, 0 unknown -- in BOTH images. The None arm is a fallback nothing in the current tables

# `docs/recon/rva-map-1162-to-1170.data.tsv` -- the GLOBALS table -- and `promote()` wrote the
# survivors to `docs/recon/rva-1170-detour-audited.tsv` with prologue verdicts like `6B
# relocatable` beside them. That was not a caveat about the output; it was a category error in
# the input, and it produced the most extreme instance of the decode-past-the-end class this
# repo has found:
#
#   * Of the 85 rows promoted on the UNWINDLESS-LEAF clause, all 85 named NON-EXECUTABLE memory.
#     The clause could never have fired on a real leaf and could never have missed a global,
#     because `.pdata` declares no enclosing function for a `.data` address for exactly the same
#     reason it declares none for an unwindless leaf. Handed the globals table, `entry_verdict`
#     reads every global as a leaf, by construction.
#   * 87 of the 444 rows named non-executable destinations (`.data` 61, `.rdata` 26).
#   * The four "leaf functions" it would have newly promoted are 24 bytes of `00` in both images
#     -- the `.data` virtual tail past its raw size. `00 00` decodes as `add byte ptr [rax], al`;
#     three of those is the `6B`.
#   * The single `loopne` refusal was right by accident: `0x142aa5a35`'s `0xe0` is the low byte
#     of a stored pointer (`0x140745be0`) in an `.rdata` vtable. Its NEIGHBOUR in the same table
#     stores `0x140735100`, low byte `0x00`, and was promoted. Adjacent slots of one vtable,
#     opposite detour verdicts, decided by the low byte of the address stored there.
#
# The lesson is now enforcement in two places rather than prose here: `function_extent.body_end`
# refuses a VA outside an executable section before it will resolve any extent, and
# `scripts/check-ledger-section-kind.py` holds every ledger to the section kind its consumer
# assumes. The tombstone rule (R3) that guarded against `--promote` regenerating the file was
# deleted with this command, because a rule guarding against nothing is worse than no rule.
