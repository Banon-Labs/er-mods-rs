// AFTER someone has already invaded -- which is useless for an agent that has to start the first
// one. The object is also reachable by reading, and er_invasion_warp does exactly that: walk
// ersc.dll's writable sections, and a qword whose `+0x58` points at something session-shaped is
// the menu object.

// Whatever needs observing about a cancel, observe it somewhere else.

// THE INVADE HOOK DETACHES ITSELF THE INSTANT IT HAS HANDED THE POINTER OVER, and that is not
// tidiness -- leaving it attached breaks the feature it exists to enable.
//
// The note above says why no hook may sit on the cancel action. The invade action has the
// identical hazard and it was not covered: `er_invasion_warp` byte-checks `ersc+0x25850`'s
// prologue before every call to it, this Interceptor writes a trampoline over exactly those
// bytes, and the DLL then reads our detour, fails its own 64-byte comparison, and refuses to
// invade. Cancel keeps working (nothing patches `ersc+0x258d0`), so rejected matches are
// cancelled and never restarted, and `arm_self_recovery` re-arms every tick against an action
// that can never fire: measured 2026-09-09 as 7523 `attempt ended without us cancelling it`
// lines with `rearmed=0`, and on 2026-09-08 as 6061/6056 in a 12826-line log.
//
// One capture is all this hook is for -- the DLL keeps the adopted pointer for the life of the
// process -- so detaching after the first hand-over costs nothing and restores the prologue the
// DLL is about to read.

        // agent on a process that adopted it earlier must still get out of the way.
