"""Is the de-Arxan'd image CODE everywhere a function is declared, or is there ciphertext left?

# The question

`eldenring-deobf-1.17.bin` is dearxan's output for the installed build, and everything this
workspace does on 1.17 -- every ledger row, every hook target, every gate that reads the flat
image -- assumes it is a faithful rendering of the game's code. dearxan proves the CORRECTNESS of
what it decrypted (the plaintext is real code). It cannot prove COMPLETENESS: a region whose
guarding stub it never found would stay ciphertext, and every downstream verdict taken from those
bytes would be a verdict about noise, silently.

This is the completeness half, run the way it was first run on 2026-07-01 against the previous
build: walk every DECLARED function and ask whether its bytes decode as code. A function that is
still encrypted cannot pass -- Arxan's at-rest filler differs from the plaintext in every single
byte (measured: of the 89309 bytes dearxan rewrites on 1.17, zero were already equal), so an
undecrypted function is maximally unlike code, not marginally.

# What counts as "declared"

Two sources, and the second is why this is not just the 2026-07-01 scan re-run:

  * `.pdata` -- the linker's own exception table. Authoritative, but BLIND TO LEAF FUNCTIONS: the
    x64 ABI omits unwind data for a function that allocates no stack and calls nothing, and this
    image has 146,715 holes between consecutive `.pdata` extents. A missing entry is not a missing
    function, so `.pdata` alone leaves most small getters unexamined.
  * `--functions`, a Ghidra function list (`scripts/dump-ghidra-function-list.py`). Ghidra's
    analysis finds ~366k functions against ~176k `.pdata` extents, so it reaches into those holes.

# The classifier, and how its thresholds were CALIBRATED rather than guessed

Per function, over a prefix bounded by the function's EXTENT (never by a byte count -- see
`scripts/function_extent.py` and the gate that enforces it):

    tail         bytes at the end of the slice capstone could not decode (an invalid opcode)
    common_frac  share of decoded instructions whose mnemonic is one a compiler emits
    distinct     distinct byte values in the prefix, over the prefix length

    FLAGGED  <=>  distinct >= 0.75  AND  (tail >= 15  OR  common_frac < 0.5)

Those numbers are not taste. 1.17 supplies a LABELLED dataset for free: the same 1371 spans exist
as ciphertext in the installed `eldenring.exe` and as plaintext in the deobfuscated image, so the
rule can be scored against known-encrypted and known-decrypted bytes at identical addresses. Over
the 831 spans of at least 32 bytes, measured 2026-08-31:

    ciphertext  flagged 88.2%   <- sensitivity
    plaintext   flagged  0.0%   <- zero false positives on decrypted code
    control     flagged  0.225% <- 4000 random `.pdata` functions

The `distinct` half alone separates them perfectly on those spans (1.000 against 0.000); it is the
`tail`/`common_frac` half that keeps ordinary-but-unusual code out. Sensitivity is per FUNCTION, and
that is the honest way to read it: a single encrypted 64-byte prefix escapes 12% of the time, but a
missed region covers a RUN of functions, and three consecutive misses have probability 0.0017.
Random bytes decode into mostly-arithmetic x86 far more often than intuition suggests -- a uniform
byte stream scores common_frac 0.78 -- which is exactly why a common-mnemonic test alone was not
enough and the two-part rule is.

Flagging is not a defect count. The 2026-07-01 run flagged 13 functions out of 228,889 and every
one turned out to be Arxan CONTROL-FLOW obfuscation -- `jmp`/`jcc` trampolines whose entry lives in
Arxan's own `.text` -- which is a different protection layer, out of dearxan's decryption scope,
and present in a runtime dump too. So the output is a rate and a CLUSTERING, and the verdict is
about where the flags fall, not how many there are. A missed decryption is regional: it would put
a dense run of flags inside one address range, not a scatter.
