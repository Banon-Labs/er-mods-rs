#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Reproduce (or refute) the shared-temp-directory test flake by running N copies of one crate's
# windows test binary AT ONCE under wine.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A test scratch path built from a fixed name under `std::env::temp_dir()` is
# the same directory in every process, because under this repo's wine runner `%TEMP%` resolves to
# the host `/tmp`. One run of `cargo test` therefore passes 100% of the time and proves nothing;
# the defect only appears when two copies overlap, which is the ordinary case here (two agents
# running `scripts/check.sh` at once, the host `cargo test` racing the wine `cargo xwin test`, or
# a second checkout). Every failure it produces ACCUSES CORRECT PRODUCT CODE -- `WrongSize
# { len: 0 }`, `MissingOrNotFile`, `BridgeWriteFailed`, an identity probe answering `Unknown` --
# so without this harness the reader is sent into code that is not wrong.
#
# `scripts/check-test-temp-isolation.py` is the static gate that stops the defect being written.
# This is the empirical counterpart: it is what you run to prove the gate is describing something
# real, and what the six 2026-08-31 before/after measurements were taken with.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/repro-shared-temp-flake.sh er-quit-menu-core            # 1 round of 8
#   bash scripts/repro-shared-temp-flake.sh er-save-redirect 10          # 10 rounds of 8
#   CONCURRENCY=16 bash scripts/repro-shared-temp-flake.sh er-soulsformats
#
# Exit status is the number of RED runs, capped at 250 -- so `if bash ... ; then` reads as
# "the crate is isolated", and a reintroduced defect is a non-zero exit.
