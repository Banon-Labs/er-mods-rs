"""Reject `CStr::from_ptr` and its wide-string siblings on pointers we did not create.

WHY THIS GATE EXISTS. On 2026-08-23 both testers' games died in MSVC `strlen`, reached from
`er_invasion_warp`'s Steam lobby hook. The pointer Steam/Seamless handed us was
`0x011000010e05acda` -- garbage, and very much NOT null, which is the entire point: the call site
guarded with `key == 0`, and a null check does nothing about junk. `CStr::from_ptr` calls `strlen`,
`strlen` dereferences until it finds a zero byte, and an unmapped page ends the process.

The fix for that one site was `er_game_base::mem::safe_read_cstr`, which reads through
`ReadProcessMemory` and fails closed. The fix for the BUG CLASS is this file: an audit on
2026-08-25 found three more sites doing exactly the same thing (two more Steam pointers in
`lobby_publish.rs`, and the game-supplied Scaleform node names in `title_resources_stats_text.rs`),
each reaching `strlen` at depth 1 in the emitted code. Being right about all four by hand once is
not the same as staying right, so the invariant is executable: the workspace currently contains
ZERO of these calls, and this keeps it there.

ESCAPE HATCH. A pointer we made ourselves and can prove is NUL-terminated is fine. Say so on the
line or the line above:

    // Foreign pointer: ours, from CString::new above -- never crosses an FFI boundary.

Writing that comment over a pointer that came from the game, from Steam, from another mod, or from
any FFI callback argument is not a waiver; it is the same bug with a note attached.
