"""End-to-end proof that the Stop-event guards actually halt a turn.

WHY THIS TEST EXISTS (2026-08-22). Every Stop guard in this repo was inert for 36 days -- from the
day the first one landed (2026-07-17) until the day this was written -- and the suite stayed green
the entire time, because the coverage was split in a way that left the real path untested:

  * scripts/test-*-signal.py           tested the SIGNAL shell scripts alone (no policy, no cupcake);
  * .cupcake/tests/*_test.rego         tested the POLICIES in the OPA INTERPRETER (`opa test`);
  * scripts/test-cupcake-policies.py   ran the real `cupcake eval` binary -- PreToolUse events ONLY.

`cupcake eval` does not use the OPA interpreter. It compiles the policies to WASM and runs them in
its own embedded runtime, where an unimplemented host builtin (`sprintf`) silently yields undefined
and the rule never fires. So the signal passed, the policy passed, the interpreter passed, and the
thing that actually runs at turn-end returned `{}` -- a clean ALLOW -- every single time.

This test closes that hole by driving the WHOLE path exactly as Claude Code does: the real
transcript on disk, the real signal scripts, the real `cupcake eval` commands read out of
.claude/settings.json, and an assertion on the verdict that comes back. Both directions are asserted
-- a guard that cannot halt is useless, and a guard that halts on a clean turn wedges every session.

IT ALSO DRIVES UserPromptSubmit (2026-08-22), because one guard deliberately does NOT halt. Claude
Code renders every Stop verdict into the user's transcript ("Stop hook error: <reason>") and Stop
fires only after the assistant's text has already been streamed, so a Stop halt on ANSWER LENGTH
makes the user read the long version, the scolding and the rewrite -- three times the reading, from
a rule whose whole purpose is less of it. wall_of_text therefore lives on UserPromptSubmit, whose
`additionalContext` is a hidden attachment and lands before the next answer is written. Two things
have to hold and both are asserted here: it must NOT halt at Stop, and its correction must actually
come back on the invisible channel.

Fixtures live in .cupcake/tests/fixtures/*.jsonl and are ordinary Claude Code transcripts.
