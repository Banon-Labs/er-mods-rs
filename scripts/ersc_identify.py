"""Identify an installed `ersc.dll` and diff it against a reference build.

Seamless Co-op is third-party and the user updates it on their own schedule. Every
pin this repo holds into `ersc.dll` -- an RVA, a struct field offset, a byte
signature, a section name -- is only valid for the build it was measured against, and
nothing in a normal build or launch notices when that build is swapped underneath.
This is the read-only check that notices.

It answers three questions and nothing else:

  * WHICH build is installed -- size, PE timestamp, and the `Seamless Co-op vX.Y.Z`
    string read out of the image, not guessed from a path;
  * WHAT the section layout is -- because v2.0.0 renamed the WinLicense VM section
    `.themida` -> `ERSC`, so any code that matched that section BY NAME is broken, and
    the durable discriminator is "executable AND writable", which both builds share;
  * WHETHER a given byte needle is present, and in which section -- so a pinned
    signature can be re-tested against a new build in one command instead of by hand.

The DLL is opened read-only and never copied, moved, or staged: `AGENTS.md` forbids
bundling it, and a diff has no reason to want a copy.

Usage:

    python3 scripts/ersc_identify.py                       # identify the installed build
    python3 scripts/ersc_identify.py --reference           # ...and diff vs the backup build
    python3 scripts/ersc_identify.py --find 80B9B50A000000 --find 80B9BD0A000000

As a library (the underscore in the filename is so this import works):

    import ersc_identify as EI
    EI.ErscImage(EI.installed_path()).version_string()   # -> "Seamless Co-op v2.0.0 by Yui"
    EI.require_version("1.9.9")                          # refuse unless that build is installed

Paths resolve env-first so this works on any machine:

    ERSC_DLL      installed build   (default: Game/SeamlessCoop/ersc.dll under the Steam install)
    ERSC_DLL_REF  reference build   (default: Game/_SeamlessCoop/ersc.dll, the backup the
                                     Seamless launcher leaves behind when it updates)
    ER_GAME_DIR   the `Game` directory both defaults hang off
