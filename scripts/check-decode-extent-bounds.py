"""Refuse a NEW forward disassembly bounded by a byte COUNT instead of a function EXTENT.

THE CLASS, IN ONE SENTENCE
--------------------------
A linear x86-64 decode starting inside the de-Arxan'd ELDEN RING images is trustworthy only until
that function's last byte; past it the decoder is reading inter-function padding and the
deobfuscator's LEFTOVER BYTES -- not a uniform `cc`/`90` run -- so it RESYNCHRONISES into
plausible-looking instructions that were never assembled, and any verdict taken from them is a
verdict about noise.

FIVE CONFIRMED INSTANCES BEFORE THIS GATE EXISTED
--------------------------------------------------
  1. `audit-1170-hook-targets.py::patch_safe` read a flat 0x400 from the hook target. On a
     14-byte leaf that is 0x3f2 bytes of the neighbours, and it manufactured a
     `jno 0x14067ac91` -- a branch into the five bytes MinHook overwrites -- out of ONE padding
     byte. The 1.17 counterpart of that function is the same fourteen bytes and stayed green only
     because its junk pad byte happened to be `28` instead of `83`. One leftover byte decided
     whether a hand-derived, four-times-confirmed correct ledger row failed.
  2. 12 false `DIVERGE` verdicts (2026-08-30), a verifier decoding past a tail call.
     `build.rs::refuted_sources` reads DIVERGES as evidence an address is WRONG and SUBTRACTS it
     from the CALL map, so the artefact deleted working addresses.
  3. 31 false `SHAPE-DIFF`s, same date, same cause.
  4. A trampoline walk that counted bytes past its own `ret`, reporting a 3-byte leaf as 8B
     relocatable and a 4-byte one as 11B.
  5. `check-singleton-field-offsets.py::_follow` (found by the 2026-08-31 sweep this gate closes)
     walked five instructions from a singleton load and collected field offsets out of the NEXT
     function. It invented `SessionManager +0x18` in 1.17 -- a `lea` six bytes past the boundary,
     and the SOLE evidence for that gate's headline claim -- and `CS::GameMan +0x0` in both
     images, whose 1.17 witnesses decode as `sar dword ptr [rax], 0x6f` and
     `and dword ptr [rax], esp`. The window parameter had been TUNED to include them.

WHAT THIS GATE ACTUALLY MATCHES
-------------------------------
An AST scan of `scripts/**/*.py` for capstone `.disasm` / `.disasm_lite` calls, classifying the
byte range handed to each:

  BOUNDED           the slice's upper bound is an independent expression -- `data[start:end]`,
                    `image[func : disp_at + 16]` (anchored on the SITE, not the start) -- or the
                    span is a SUBTRACTION of two endpoints (`off : off + (end - begin)`), which is
                    an extent length wearing an addition. Nothing to justify.
  SPAN-FROM-START   the upper bound is the lower bound PLUS a length: `blob[off : off + N]`. This
                    is the shape of all five instances. Every such site needs a row in
                    `decode-extent-allowlist.tsv` saying why it is safe, or the gate goes red.
  UNRESOLVED        the first argument is not a slice this scan can follow to its bounds -- a
                    parameter, a helper's return value. NOT A PASS: it is printed and counted
                    every run, because instance 5's sibling in `map-callsite-rva-1162-to-1170.py`
                    hid in exactly that shape (the caller fabricated the extent, so the callee
                    looked extent-bounded).

Spans of 16 or fewer literal bytes are exempt without a row: the longest x86-64 instruction is 15
bytes, so such a decode cannot leave the instruction it starts on, let alone the function.

THE FIX FOR A NEW HIT IS `scripts/function_extent.py`
-----------------------------------------------------
`function_extent.body_end(blob, va)` resolves the extent from `.pdata`'s declared start, then an
enclosing declared extent, then a decoded leaf watermark -- and returns None rather than guessing.
IMPORT IT. A second implementation of extent resolution is the next divergence bug: the rule's own
history is two earlier wrong versions, and a hand-rolled `.pdata` walk written during the
2026-08-31 sweep dropped a legitimate `CS::PlayerGameData +0xe5` witness because it did not merge
chunk runs.
