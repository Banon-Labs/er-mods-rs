"""Generate the shipped `er-npc-possess` moveset table from the unpacked corpus.

The table is INTEGERS ONLY -- chr id, animation ids, bucket, rank, reach band and a
denial-reason code. No game bytes, no asset payloads, no strings lifted out of the
game: everything here is a decision *about* an integer id, and the ids themselves are
already public knowledge (they are BND entry filenames). That is what makes it
committable under the repo's no-game-derived-binaries rule.

FIVE OFFLINE SOURCES, joined per creature:

  behavior graph   <chr>.behbnd.dcx (Havok TAG0)  fireable EVENT NAME -> state -> clip
  TimeAct          <chr>.tae                      ability events + event times
  regulation.bin   NpcParam -> BehaviorParam      judge id -> AtkParam_Npc / Bullet
  regulation.bin   AtkParam_Npc                   damage, hit-capsule radii, throwTypeId
  regulation.bin   ThrowParam                     throwTypeId -> victim chr id + range

A GRAB IS AN ORDINARY ATTACK WITH ONE COLUMN SET. It is not a 4000-band animation and it
is not TAE event 304. `CS::ChrDamageModule::ApplyDamage` looks up the landed hit's
`AtkParam` row, reads `throwTypeId`, and -- before any damage is calculated -- calls
`CSChrThrowModule::InitThrow(attackerThrowModule, victimChrIns, throwTypeId)`.
`CSThrowNode::ValidateAttemptAndReturnParamId` then scans `ThrowParam` for a row matching
(attacker npcId, victim npcId, throwTypeId); on a hit, the throw system drives BOTH parties
into that row's `atkAnimId`/`defAnimId`. Those are the 4000-band clips, which is exactly why
no event name reaches them: they are downstream of a throw that has already been accepted.

So the fireable thing is the INITIATOR, and it was already in this table as a plain attack.
Swept over the corpus: 153 fireable initiator ANIMATIONS across 78 creatures (169 counting
(animation, throwTypeId) pairs), EVERY ONE in the 3000 band, against 108 TAE-304 clips of
which ZERO are fireable.

WHY THE GRAPH AND NOT THE TAE DECIDES WHAT SHIPS: the graph is a strict superset (c2120
has 41 fireable attack events against 36 TAE attacks, c3200 30 against 10) and every TAE
attack animation has a graph event. So the graph says what can be FIRED and the TAE says
which of those opens a damage window.

FIREABILITY IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS SCRIPT. Declared != fireable: median 1366 declared
event names per chr against median 580 that a `hkbStateMachine::TransitionInfo` actually
consumes. Firing a declared-but-unconsumed name resolves fine and then SILENTLY NO-OPS --
no error, no log, nothing on screen -- so the gate has to happen here, at generation time,
where it can be checked, rather than at runtime where it cannot be observed.

#: The animation-id bands this table covers. Banding is a FromSoft convention, not a
#: proof -- the authoritative "is this an attack" answer is the BehaviorParam join

#: `CSChrEventModule::requestAnimationId` formats its event name as `W_Event%04d`
#: unconditionally. That field write costs no game function address, so it is always the
#: PREFERRED way to fire an animation -- but it is not a universal one.
FIRE_PREFIX = 'W_Event'

#: EVERY SPELLING AN ANIMATION ID CAN HAVE, in the order the generator prefers them.
#:
#: `W_Event` is a broad alias layer, not a total one: measured at 88.4% num==anim-id
#: across the corpus, against 100% for `W_Step` in 6000-6023 and for the ride families.
#: So dodges, goal actions and the ride sets have NO `W_Event` name, and the field write
#: cannot ask for them however fireable they are -- c2120's 6000/6001/6002/6003/6011
#: resolve under `W_Step` and under nothing else.
#:
#: The order is the policy. `W_Event` first, because choosing it keeps the possession on
#: the path that resolves no game function address. Everything after it costs one call to
#: `PlayAnimationByBehaviorName`, so it is only chosen when `W_Event` cannot reach the id.
#: The ride families sit LAST on purpose: `W_Ridden_Enemy_Step` is what a mount plays
#: while someone is riding it, and driving that into a free-standing creature is the kind
#: of thing the runtime watchdog exists to catch. They are kept because they are 100%
#: identity and are sometimes the only spelling that reaches an id at all.
#:
#: THE PREFIX IS RESOLVED PER CHR FROM THAT CHR'S OWN EVENT TABLE, never from the band.
#: A band tells you what to try; only the chr's own `TransitionInfo` set says what works.

#:
#: `W_Ride_Attack_`, `W_RideStep`, `W_Ridden_Enemy_Attack`, `W_Ride_Enemy_Attack`,

#: like free coverage. A full sweep with them included says otherwise: they were chosen
#: for **zero** of the 6921 shipped moves -- every id they reach is also reached by
#: `W_Event` or `W_Step`, which outrank them -- while adding roughly six thousand
#: `no-damage-window` denial rows for mount-only animations and doubling the table to
#: 224 KB.
#:
#: They are also semantically wrong for this mod even when they are the only spelling:
#: `W_Ridden_Enemy_Step` is what a mount plays while somebody is RIDING it, and a
#: possessed creature is not being ridden. Firing one is a softlock the watchdog would
#: have to clean up.

#: and swept over the whole corpus, ZERO of the 108 animations carrying it are fireable
#: under any prefix. That is not a wall the graph puts up; it is that these clips are never
#: addressed by id. `CSChrThrowModule::PlayThrowAnim` reaches them through the two BARE
#: names `W_ThrowAtk` (attacker) and `W_ThrowDef` (defender), and which clip that lands on
#: is `ThrowParam.atkAnimId` / `defAnimId` for the row the throw system already picked.

#: case that means "this attack may now be cancelled into another attack" is **86**, whose
#: body is `actionRequest->taeCancels |= 0x20` -- the bit `CS::CSAiFunc::IsEnableCancelAttack`
#: (`0x140300800` -> `0x1404075a0`, `taeCancels & 0x20 && !(taeCancels >> 0xb & 1)`) reads.
#: That is the GAME's own per-animation answer to "may this swing be left yet", asked of a
#: creature rather than of the player, which is exactly the question a possessed creature has.
#:
#: **86 IS THE CREATURE ONE AND 4 IS THE PLAYER ONE, AND THEY ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE.**
#: FlagType 4 (`CANCEL_R1_R2_LIGHT_KICK_HEAVY_KICK`) is the combo window everybody means when
#: they say "TAE combo window", and it covers 78.8% of c0000's 5,322 attack animations -- but
#: only 19 of the 6,419 non-player attack animations in this corpus, 0.3%. Building the window
#: on 4 would have produced a table that was empty for almost every creature this mod can
#: possess. 86 covers 91.1% of them. 4 is still accepted as a fallback for the handful that
#: carry it, since both cases mean the same thing to their own kind of character.
#:
#: `GetActiveAnimEvent` (`0x14264e420`) re-executes an event on every frame whose playhead
