"""Regression for the fix-claim classifier, in both directions.

The Rego suite pins what the policy does with a facts line; this pins where the facts line comes
from. Both halves matter, and the split is deliberate: a policy can be green while the classifier
that feeds it has drifted into calling every mention of the word a claim, which is the failure mode
that makes a guard get switched off.

It imports `scripts/cupcake_fix_claim.py`, the single definition that
`.cupcake/signals/last_assistant_fix_claim_without_runtime_evidence.sh` also uses, so the test
cannot pass against a classifier production does not run.

Six things are pinned:
  * fix_claim          -- the assertive shapes convict, and a path, a slug, a fixture, a quoted or
                          backticked word, a table cell and a modal never do;
  * hedged             -- an honest admission that the change has not run exempts;
  * externally_blocked -- a dependency the agent cannot dissolve, including a decision handed back;
  * host_object        -- a sentence that fixes a gate and names nothing inside the game exempts,
                          while one that leans on a passing test does not;
  * runtime_crates     -- the walk over the workspace manifests still separates the crates that can
                          reach a DLL from the host-only ones, so the guard cannot go silently inert
                          by finding nothing to convict;
  * runtime_evidence   -- a build is not evidence, a launch is not evidence, and a log read before
                          the edit is not evidence for it.
