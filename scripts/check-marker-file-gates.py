"""Forbid marker-text-file feature gates in the DLL source; permit only justified diagnostics.

POLICY (deprecate-env-marker-gate-allowlists-no-gated-features-2026-07-19)
=========================================================================
User directive: "we don't want any env/marker gated features." A "marker-file gate" is
any `.join("er-quickload-<name>.txt")` in `crates/er-quickload/src/**/*.rs` whose result
is consumed by `.exists()` -- the boolean on/off toggle shape, SEMANTICALLY IDENTICAL to
an env-var gate. (Data control files read with `read_to_string`, e.g. a slot number, are
NOT toggles and are out of scope.)

The former grandfathering allowlist `sanctioned_marker_gate_names` and the
`migrate_to_default` ratchet are DEPRECATED: they are kept in the baseline JSON only so
their emptiness is explicit, and this checker FAILS if either is non-empty. With the
behavioral allowlist empty, EVERY marker gate hard-fails UNLESS its marker NAME appears
in `diagnostic_gates` (in `.auto/marker_file_gate_baseline.json`) with a non-empty
rationale AND the enclosing fn does NOT classify as behavioral.

`diagnostic_gates` is the ONLY permitted exception and is reserved for genuinely
diagnostic toggles that change NO game behavior (passive logging/telemetry/trace,
read-only sampling). A behavioral fix must be DEFAULT behavior (gated only on a real
runtime condition) or removed; it may never be re-added as a marker gate. Adding a
`diagnostic_gates` entry is a deliberate reviewed act that shows in the diff and must
carry a justification.

BEHAVIORAL vs DIAGNOSTIC classification
=======================================
For every detected gate the checker mechanically classifies the enclosing `fn` body
(brace-matched) as `behavioral`, `diagnostic`, or `unknown` by scanning for tokens
(raw-pointer writes, memory patchers, detour installs, native side-effect calls =
behavioral; logging/telemetry = diagnostic). A `diagnostic_gates` exception is REJECTED
if its fn classifies as behavioral, so a behavioral fix can never sneak in as a
"diagnostic" gate.

The declarative policy lives at `.auto/marker_file_gate_policy.rego`; this checker
asserts that file exists and contains its required snippets so it cannot silently drift.

READS ONLY REAL CODE (2026-08-30)
=================================
Every fact below is derived from source text with comments and string bodies blanked by
the shared `code_only` reader, never from raw text. Raw text broke this gate in BOTH
directions, and only one of them was ever going to be noticed:

  - LOUD. `classify()` read prose. Measured over the live tree at the time of this fix,
    15 functions classified `behavioral` purely because a comment said `transmute`,
    `SetState`, `install_detour` or `write_volatile` while explaining that the code no
    longer does any such thing. Any of those functions acquiring a sanctioned marker
    toggle would have produced a `marker-gate-diagnostic-is-behavioral` finding against
    a sentence.
  - SILENT. The `.exists()` window in `statement_is_exists_gate` stops at the first
    `;`, `{` or `}` in RAW text, so a trailing `// toggle; see note {here}` comment ends
    the window before `.exists()` is reached and a real gate is never detected at all.
    Nothing surfaces that. The frozen `comment_truncated_gate` control in `selftest`
    pins it. Brace-matching in `fn_body_text` had the same exposure.

The required-`.rego`-snippet facts were the silent shape again -- a REQUIRE satisfied by
a comment -- so they are now split into STRUCTURAL snippets that must be real Rego logic
and DOCUMENTARY snippets that are prose by design.
