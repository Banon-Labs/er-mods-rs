# ACCEPT-BYTE + FOCUS advance test (user guidance 2026-06-22): advance press-any-button by TRICKING THE
# DECODED "a button was pressed" bit (the global accept byte 0x144589bdc=1, set ONCE -- not raw input,
# not state-machine manipulation, so no logo-replay/loop), WHILE keeping ER's input-accept flag forced
# (STAY_ACTIVE -> [DLUID+0x88d]=1 every tick) so the advance registers even though the probe window is
# UNFOCUSED (the user noted press-any-button needs focus). No own_load / own_stepper / product_core
# (all of which loop/crash). Goal: does the title advance CLEANLY to the main menu (no loop) this time?
# User raw input is force-BLOCKED (the accept byte is a decoded flag, unaffected by the block).
