"""Second opinion on a 1.16.2 -> 1.17 pair, from Ghidra's analysis of BOTH runtime dumps.

WHY A SECOND OPINION IS WORTH ANYTHING HERE. `map-rvas-1162-to-1170.py` finds where a masked
signature re-occurs and `verify-rva-map-1170.py` decodes both bodies and compares them. Both read
the same two flat images, with the same decoder, under the same normalisation -- so they share a
failure mode: if a wrong destination happens to decode into a stream shaped like the right one,
neither notices, and the second tool's agreement adds nothing the first did not already assume.

The two Ghidra dumps are genuinely independent of that. They were analysed by Ghidra's own
disassembler and function-boundary analysis, from the runtime images rather than the de-Arxan'd
files, months apart, and this asks them three questions the byte tools cannot ask at all:

    ENTRY   does each dump declare a function to START at its half of the pair? A destination
            0x10 bytes into a function reads as live and detours into the middle of one. A
            declared entry at the WRONG address is the hard failure; NO declared entry is not one,
            because that is the ordinary condition of a leaf.
    CALLEES do the two functions call the SAME functions, carried forward? Topology, which no byte
            signature over a 40-byte prologue can see. 1.17's dump carries no names -- everything
            is `FUN_<addr>` -- but its call graph is there, so each 1.16.2 callee can be matched to
            a 1.17 callee at a plausible forward delta. A wrong destination carries almost none of
            them; a right one carries nearly all. Where a dump has no call graph for a function at
            all, the question is vacuous rather than answered.
    SIZE    do the two dumps declare the same body length? Reported, never fatal. A body that GREW
            is what `PATCH-SITE-IDENTICAL` exists to describe, and refusing it here would
            contradict the verifier's own vocabulary.

WHAT THE CALLEE TOLERANCE IS FOR, measured rather than chosen. `0x1409a4ed0 -> 0x1409a6070` --
`PROFILE_LOAD_DIALOG_LIST_REBUILD_RVA`, verified `IDENTICAL-WHOLE` over its whole 261-byte body --
carries four of its five callees and loses one, because 1.17's dump does not split out a function
where 1.16.2's does. Requiring all five would refuse a pair the instruction comparison proves. So
a quarter of them, and never fewer than one, may fail to carry. The four that DO carry are worth
seeing: two of them cross out of this region entirely, `0x875590 -> 0x876580` at +0xff0 and
`0x739e20 -> 0x73ac70` at +0xe50, each landing on the delta its own region is known to have.

None of that is a hook licence; `.pdata` entry evidence and the instruction comparison remain the
licence. This is the check that catches a plausible WRONG address before it becomes an anchor and
spreads its delta over a whole region.

WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT THE CURATED LEDGER, run over all 111 rows of
`docs/recon/rva-map-1162-to-1170.verified.tsv` on 2026-09-01: 111/111, no contradictions -- 55
CONFIRMED, 55 CONFIRMED-THIN (leaves, where one dump has no call graph to compare), 1
NO-DUMP-OPINION (a 3-byte leaf neither dump declares at all). The two rows that DID come back
refused on the first pass were both correct, and both loosenings in `judge` are named after them.

Both dump VAs are shift-0: dump VA == deobf VA == runtime VA on 1.16.2 and on 1.17 alike, so the
addresses here need no translation in either direction.

USAGE
    python3 scripts/confirm-1170-pair-in-dumps.py 0x1409a4670:0x1409a5810
    python3 scripts/confirm-1170-pair-in-dumps.py --tsv docs/recon/rva-map-1162-to-1170.verified.tsv
    python3 scripts/confirm-1170-pair-in-dumps.py --tsv <pairs.tsv> --quiet

Needs both MCP daemons: 1.16.2 on :8765 (`scripts/ghidra/mcp-up-1162.sh`) and 1.17 on :8767
(`scripts/ghidra/mcp-up-1170.sh`). Skips at exit 0 when either is down, because "could not look"
is not evidence of agreement. Exits 1 when a pair is contradicted.
