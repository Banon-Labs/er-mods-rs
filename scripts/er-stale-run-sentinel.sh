# Tear down a live Elden Ring run the moment an edited file CONTRIBUTES TO A DLL THAT RUN LOADED.
#
# WHY
# ---
# A live run has DLLs loaded from a particular state of this tree. The instant a file that feeds one
# of those DLLs changes, that run is STALE: its loaded code no longer matches the source, so anything
# observed in it is evidence about a build that no longer exists. Two concrete ways that bit us:
#
#   * a newly built DLL "validated" inside a process that had loaded the previous one;
#   * two live processes appending to the SAME log files next to the game exe, so one run's
#     lines land in the other's evidence -- and a per-process counter reading "#2" gets
#     misread as one process doing something twice.
#
# Advisory rules did not prevent either. AGENTS.md said to tear down; bd memories said to tear
# down; it kept happening, because an advisory rule only fires if it is recalled at the right
# moment. This sentinel does not rely on anyone remembering: it runs from the PostToolUse hook
# that already fires on Edit/MultiEdit/Write, and kills the stale run automatically.
#
# WHY "GIT-TRACKED" WAS THE WRONG TEST
# ------------------------------------
# The first version tore down whenever the edited path was inside the repo and not gitignored. The
# invariant it enforced is right; the test was far too broad, because "the repo cares about this
# file" is not "this file is compiled into a DLL this run loaded". Every one of these killed a run
# mid-measurement on 2026-08-04, each costing a user-driven invasion, and NONE of them changes a
# single byte of any loaded DLL:
#
#   * scripts/frida-trace-ersc.py, scripts/frida-steam-matchmaking-trace.py -- HOST-side frida
#     scripts, never linked into anything;
#   * scripts/er-launch-gate.py -- a host-side gate that runs BEFORE a launch, not inside one;
#   * .cupcake/policies/claude/*.rego -- agent policy, not code at all (and a background subagent
#     writing one tore down a run the main agent had just launched, after which the teardown was
#     misattributed to the subagent).
#
# THE TEST NOW
# ------------
# Tear down only if the edited file plausibly contributes to a DLL the CURRENTLY RUNNING profile
# loads. In order:
#
#   1. outside the repo, or gitignored inside it   -> SKIP (build output and logs never make a run
#      stale; that is what stops a log line killing a run)
#   2. nothing live                                -> SKIP (nothing at stake, and no cargo run)
#   3. the loaded-DLL set cannot be determined     -> FALLBACK: tear down (see FAIL SAFE below)
#   4. inside a workspace crate                    -> tear down IFF that package is in the
#      dependency closure of the loaded cdylibs, else SKIP
#   5. under an inert top-level directory          -> SKIP
#   6. anything else                               -> FALLBACK: tear down
#
# The loaded-DLL set is ground truth, not a guess: the live `me3` process's command line carries
# `-p <profile>`, the profile is TOML whose `[[natives]]` entries name the exact DLLs loaded, and
# `cargo metadata` maps each of those DLL filenames back to the package that emits it. Deriving the
# filename from the package name would be WRONG -- four crates override `[lib] name`
# (er-ags-stub -> amd_ags_x64.dll, er-inventory-sort -> er_inventory_sort.dll, ...), which is
# the same trap scripts/check-me3-shell-coverage.py exists to catch -- so the cdylib TARGET name
# from cargo metadata is used instead. Nothing here is hardcoded.
#
# DEPENDENCY CLOSURE IS THE LOAD-BEARING PART. Editing crates/er-invasion-warp-core/src/*.rs changes
# er_invasion_warp.dll even though the crate names differ, and crates/er-game-base changes both
# product DLLs. The closure is walked over cargo metadata's path-dependency edges, ALL kinds
# included (normal, build and dev): a dev-dependency cannot really reach the cdylib, but counting it
# only over-triggers, and over-triggering is the safe direction.
#
# COST, MEASURED NOT GUESSED
# --------------------------
# This runs on EVERY edit, so the added latency was measured rather than assumed (15 runs each,
# this machine, 2026-08-04):
#
#   gate 1 short-circuit (outside repo / gitignored)   ~25 ms   -- unchanged from the old sentinel
#   full classify, nothing else running                ~57 ms   -- +~32 ms
#   full classify, game running and eating CPU        ~125 ms   -- +~95 ms
#
# `cargo metadata --no-deps` is 22 ms of that. Crucially the classify step runs ONLY when a run is
# actually live: with nothing running the hook short-circuits before cargo is ever invoked, which is
# the overwhelmingly common case. So no cache. A cached crate map would also fail in the WRONG
# direction -- a map stale by one Cargo.toml edit reports "not in the closure" for a crate that now
# is, i.e. it fails open, silently, which is the exact failure mode this whole file exists to avoid.
#
# FAIL SAFE, NOT OPEN
# -------------------
# If the profile cannot be read, the crate map cannot be built, or the path cannot be classified,
# fall back to the ORIGINAL behaviour and tear down. A sentinel that silently stops protecting is
# worse than one that is occasionally too eager, because its failure mode is contaminated evidence
# that nobody notices. Every decision is logged with the branch that produced it.
#
# THE LOG
# -------
# Twice on 2026-08-04 "what tore this run down?" could not be answered after the fact -- the reason
# went to the hook's stdout and nowhere else -- and both guesses were wrong (frida-gadget once, a
# subagent once). Every check now appends one tab-separated line to $ER_SENTINEL_LOG (default
# ${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/er-effects-rs/stale-run-sentinel.log, outside the repo):
# timestamp, verdict, branch, edited path, reason, live profiles, killed pids. "Which edit killed
# the run" is now a lookup.
#
# USAGE
#   scripts/er-stale-run-sentinel.sh check <path>              # tear down if <path> feeds a loaded DLL
#   scripts/er-stale-run-sentinel.sh classify <path> [prof...] # print the verdict, kill nothing
#   scripts/er-stale-run-sentinel.sh teardown                  # unconditional teardown + verify
#   scripts/er-stale-run-sentinel.sh status
#   scripts/er-stale-run-sentinel.sh --selftest
#
# `--selftest` covers the CLASSIFIER in both directions and never calls teardown (scripts/check.sh
# runs it, and a real game may be live). The other half -- /proc discovery of the live profile, and
# the kill itself -- is proven against a decoy process by
# scripts/test-er-stale-run-sentinel-e2e.sh, which is destructive by design and so is run by hand.
#
# As a hook it reads the tool payload as JSON on stdin and extracts the edited path itself.
