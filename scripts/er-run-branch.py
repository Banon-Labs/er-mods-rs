"""Launch Elden Ring with the DLLs this branch changed, on a random decoded character.

Pipeline, in order, each step refusing rather than guessing:

  1. Garbage-collect dead runs. Cleanup is guaranteed by this step, not by the reaper.
  2. Steam PREFLIGHT via scripts/steam-running.sh. With Steam down the game still boots, but
     into a different environment (wineprefix, save dir, account id), so the logs land
     elsewhere and the run is not representative.
  3. Closure -- scripts/er-dll-closure.py. Refuses on a conflict it cannot rank.
  4. Provenance -- scripts/er-dll-provenance.py per selected DLL. A DLL with no provenance,
     or whose recorded source hash no longer matches this tree, is stale and stops the run.
     Nothing here builds: this tool's contract is that the DLL is already fresh, and if it is
     not, it says so loudly.
  5. Save -- scripts/er-pick-save.py. Random, but DECODED FIRST: the character's name, level
     and slot are known and printed before anything launches (AGENTS.md's Autoload Identity
     Launch Gate). `--seed` reproduces a pick exactly.
  6. Stage -- a temp .me3 plus a DLL-adjacent sidecar toml. The game-directory er-quickload.toml
     is never written.
  7. Launch -- ~/Elden/launch.sh with ME3_PROFILE, detached into its own session, and with every
     DLL artifact redirected into this run's own directory (ARTIFACT_ENV). A game-directory log is
     single-slot; two launches and the run before last is gone.
  8. Testimony -- the block is printed only after the DLL says, in its own debug log, that it
     loaded and read this run's sidecar. Otherwise a failed block is printed and the run is
     cleaned up.
  9. REAP -- a detached reaper removes the staged files when the game exits. It removes what the
     run staged, never what the run WROTE: the artifact directory survives.

Why the block waits for the DLL rather than the window
------------------------------------------------------
"The process started" is a weak claim -- me3 spawns through Proton and a crashing game is
briefly alive. "The window is up" is a strong claim but minutes away, well past the shell
budget. The DLL's own `runtime-config: loaded ... sidecar=...` line lands at DllMain, within
seconds, and proves three things at once: the process is up, our DLL is in it, and it read
our config. So the block cannot be printed for a run that did not really happen -- which
matters because a copy-pasted block is a promise to whoever reads it.

The block deliberately claims nothing about the window, the world, or readiness. `--status`
re-checks those later, honestly, once they exist.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/er-run-branch.py                      # random save, ersc loaded
    python3 scripts/er-run-branch.py --seed 4242          # reproduce a pick
    python3 scripts/er-run-branch.py --vanilla            # no ersc; .sl2 saves only
    python3 scripts/er-run-branch.py --monitor DP-1       # move the ER window when it appears
    python3 scripts/er-run-branch.py --dry-run            # stage and report, launch nothing
    python3 scripts/er-run-branch.py --status <run-id>
    python3 scripts/er-run-branch.py --selftest

# That version said "measured: a cold Proton start took 62 seconds from launch.sh to the first DLL
# log line". No such measurement was ever taken. What existed were two runs that printed
# `ELDEN RING DID NOT START` after waiting 25s while the game went on to boot normally, and a
# 25-second timeout bounds the start from below -- it says ">25s" and nothing whatsoever about 62.
# A number invented to justify a change was written down as evidence, which is worse than leaving
# the constant unexplained.
#
# Measured 2026-09-04, properly, over 11 runs: launch -> DLL attach is 3.3-4.1s, median 3.7s (the
# run id is the launch time and the crash-logging breadcrumb's mtime is the attach). So the boot is
# an order of magnitude faster than the retracted figure, and 25s was not too short for attach.
# What the two condemned runs actually hit was the witness looking in the wrong place: they loaded
# only shells that write `.txt`, and the glob was `*.log` (see `testimony_candidates`). The budget
# stays generous anyway because a slow first-run shader compile is real and a false
# `DID NOT START` is expensive, but it is a margin, not a measurement of the typical case.
# This budget is the wait for the first sign of life, not a runtime cap -- the run's own idle/stall
# backstop is `.auto/runtime_timeout_cap_seconds` (300s) and is untouched by this. It is also not a
# subprocess timeout, so it is outside `scripts/check-no-timeouts.py`'s 30s ceiling; `SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT`

    Why this exists. The sidecar line proves three things at once -- process up, our DLL in it,

    reads the sidecar. Once the launcher/watchdog/guard work merged to main, the closure started
    selecting DLL sets that legitimately exclude that shell, and the gate went on waiting for a
    witness the run never loaded. It then condemned a perfectly healthy game: run
    br-20260817-184836-d6a7 printed `ELDEN RING DID NOT START` while `eldenring.exe` was up and
    the invasion DLL was heartbeating into its own log.

    So when the strong witness is unavailable, ask a weaker question honestly rather than a
    strong one wrongly: has any log next to the executable gained bytes since we launched? That
    proves the process is up and one of our shells is running in it. It does not prove which
    sidecar was read, and the caller must not claim that it does.

    Matching is by mtime rather than by a DLL-name -> log-name table on purpose: those names do
    not follow a convention (`er_net_effects.dll` writes `er-net-effects.log`,
    `er_invasion_warp.dll` writes `er-invasion-warp.log`), so a table would be a second
    source of truth that silently rots every time a shell is added.

    Several directories, not one, and the reason is this tool's own success. Every artifact knob
    it sets moves a DLL's log out of the game directory and into the run directory -- which is the
    point -- so watching only the game directory means the better this redirect gets, the blinder
    this witness becomes. It went fully blind on 2026-09-04, the day `er_crash_logging` gained its
    knobs: a run whose only shell was the crash logger wrote all four of its files into the run
    directory, the game directory never changed, and this reported `ELDEN RING DID NOT START` for
    a game that was up and busy. Watch both, and let whichever one speaks be the witness.
