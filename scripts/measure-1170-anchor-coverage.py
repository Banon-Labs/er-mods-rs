"""How much of an address range can `map-rvas-1162-to-1170.py` resolve, and what do anchors buy?

WHY A MEASUREMENT AND NOT AN IMPRESSION. "The map is sparse around 0x9axxxx" is the kind of claim
that gets repeated for months without anybody knowing whether it is still true. This runs the
mapper over EVERY `.pdata`-declared function entry in a range and counts, so the sparseness has a
number and a fix has a before and an after.

THE ONE-ADDRESS-AT-A-TIME RULE, which is the whole point of the harness. `resolve_all` lets the
addresses in a work list anchor EACH OTHER: map fifty neighbours together and the ones that match
uniquely settle the ones that do not, so a batch run flatters itself and tells you nothing about
the situation an agent is actually in -- holding ONE address that a feature needs. So every entry
here is mapped ALONE. Pass 1 is computed once per address (`map_all`) and pass 2 is then run under
each anchor policy over that same cached candidate list, which is both fast and the only way to be
sure the two policies were judged on identical evidence.

    resolved-alone   the address maps with no help: its signature matched exactly once
    resolved-anchor  its signature matched several places and a nearby verified pair's delta
                     picked one of them
    unresolved       neither -- the honest answer, and a Ghidra lookup

USAGE

    ... --list-candidates           # the resolved-alone entries: what a new anchor can be cut from
    ... --list-unresolved

Ranges are 1.16.2 RVAs, `LO:HI`, half-open. The default is the three regions
`er-effects-rs-4uw5.13` names. Skips at exit 0 without the two gitignored de-Arxan'd images.
