# Rust format + build gate. Catches pre-existing rust breakage (format drift AND a broken
# cross-compile of the actual DLL), not just the static python checks. Runs:
#   1. `cargo fmt --all -- --check`  (formatting must be clean)
#   2. a Windows-target BUILD of the injectable DLL, cross-compiled from Linux via cargo-xwin
#      (preferred; falls back to a plain `cargo build` for the target only if cargo-xwin is
#      unavailable -- that path needs an MSVC toolchain on PATH and will otherwise fail at the
#      C-dependency link step).
#   3. a Windows-target `cargo check --tests` of the DLL crate, so its `#[cfg(test)]` modules are
#      compiled (a cdylib build alone never touches them)
#   4. the resulting Windows unit-test binaries, RUN under wine when wine is installed
#
# A BUILD (not just `cargo check`) is used deliberately so the produced
# `target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/<profile>/er_effects_rs.dll` is proven to link, catching
# codegen/link regressions a metadata-only check would miss.

	# `DllMain` -- i.e. every DLL a user can list in an me3 `[[natives]]` entry except the
	# product itself -- were never linked by ANY gate. A shell that cannot link (missing

	# block) passed the whole suite while being unloadable. Found when er-invasion-warp
	# had to be built by hand with an ad-hoc `-p` to run it at all (bd er-effects-rs-5es).

	# Keep this list in sync with the cdylibs that define `DllMain`. Measured cost: well under
	# a second per shell incrementally, which is cheap enough to run unconditionally. (The

	# er-ags-stub produces amd_ags_x64.dll. Deriving the filename would silently skip those,
	# which is how four overridden `[lib] name`s went unchecked before.
