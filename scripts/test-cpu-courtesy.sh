# Prove scripts/lib/cpu-courtesy.sh actually binds -- all five levers, not just the two with
# obvious env vars.
#
# Why a test and not an EYEBALL: the library's whole claim is that it caps parallelism the caller
# never asked about. Four of its five levers are invisible to the process that sets them
# (`CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` and `SWEEP_JOBS` are read by children; the affinity mask is read by
# `os.sched_getaffinity` inside an unrelated Python pool; the scheduling policy is read back via
# `chrt -p` in a child, not from the setter), so "it printed a line" proves nothing. Each assertion
# below therefore observes the lever from where it is actually consumed.
#
# Measured 2026-09-06, the failure this exists to keep fixed: with every gate process reniced to
# 19, scripts/check-moveset-table.py still held 81.4% of a 16-core box, because it sizes its pool
# from os.cpu_count(). Priority decides who wins a contended core; it does nothing about how many
# cores are contended.
#
# The SCHED-idle lever gets a different shape of assertion, not a literal one. On this machine
# `chrt -i` is the lever that actually survives ananicy-cpp's periodic renice (see
# scripts/lib/cpu-courtesy.sh); on a GitHub runner or a locked-down container `chrt` may be
# absent, or present but refused. The probe therefore re-attempts the same idempotent `chrt -i -p
# 0` call itself and reports whether it could set the policy; the assertion only expects
# `SCHED_IDLE` when the probe just proved the syscall is available, so a runner without it self-
# reports "nothing to assert" instead of failing.
#
# Every number here is derived from the live machine, never a literal. A GitHub runner has 2-4
# cores, and `taskset -c 0-3` on a 2-core box fails (best-effort, so it silently changes nothing)
# -- an assertion written as "affinity == 4" would then fail on the runner while passing here.
