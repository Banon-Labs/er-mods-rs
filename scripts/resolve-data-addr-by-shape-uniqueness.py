"""Resolve a 1.16.2 `.data` RVA into its 1.17 address by INSTRUCTION-SHAPE UNIQUENESS.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`scripts/map-data-rvas-1162-to-1170.py` carries a global by VOTING: it finds every
rip-relative reference in 1.16.2 `.text`, maps each enclosing function onto 1.17 through
the function map, re-reads the same instruction there, and lets the references agree.
That needs the enclosing function to be mappable. A global whose only reference lives in
the de-Arxan'd image's trampoline rubble -- `jmp`/`int3` soup with no `.pdata` entry --
has nothing to vote with, and the mapper correctly reports `no usable reference` rather
than guessing. Two such globals cost real features:

    0x3d6c5e8  RETURN_TITLE_FINAL_FUNCTOR_GLOBAL_FLAG_RVA   339,684 refusals in one session
    0x3d69920  SAVE_SERIALIZE_BYTES_RVA                     er-save-disable refused outright

This tool is the fallback for exactly that class, and it is deliberately narrow.

THE ARGUMENT
------------
A global has no content of its own, but the INSTRUCTION that references it does. Blank the
displacement -- the one field a rebuild is guaranteed to change -- and what is left is the
opcode, the registers and any trailing immediate: a byte SHAPE that a patch does not
rewrite. Then:

    SOURCE   in 1.16.2, exactly N sites of that masked shape resolve to the address.
    TARGET   in 1.17,   exactly N sites of that same masked shape resolve to the candidate.

The shape ALONE does not select an address -- `mov byte ptr [rip+d], 1` reaches hundreds of
distinct addresses image-wide, and with N == 1 most of them have a count of 1 too. So the
shape CONFIRMS and a window SELECTS. The window comes from the map's own already-carried
neighbours: the nearest independently-mapped anchors on each side of the address, and how
far each of them moved. A candidate has to be a shape match, inside the bracket, AND the
only address in that bracket whose site count matches. Anything else prints UNRESOLVED with
the reason, because a missing address costs a feature and a confident wrong one cost a boot.

Both flat images are de-Arxan'd, so file offset == RVA and VA == 0x140000000 + offset.
