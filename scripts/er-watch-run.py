"""Follow one `er-run-branch.py` run and print only the lines that decide something.

Why this exists. A run's evidence is spread across three files that answer different questions --
`er-quickload-autoload-debug.log` (what the product's ending-request machinery did),
`er-input-harness.log` (whether the harness actually drove, or stood down `passive`), and
`er-quickload-telemetry.json` (the RAM oracles: which character, which map, is the player up).
Tailing any one of them alone has repeatedly produced a wrong reading of a run.

It also ends. A boot deadlock (bd er-effects-rs-1742) leaves the process alive, 60+ threads,
~0 CPU, and the DLL log simply stops -- indistinguishable from "still loading" unless something
watches for the silence. `--stall-seconds` of no growth prints `WEDGED` and exits, so a hung run
ends the wait instead of consuming it.

Window placement is reported by class only (`steam_app_1245620`), never by enumerating clients:
AGENTS.md forbids dumping the user's window list.
