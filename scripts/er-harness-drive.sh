# Drive the live Elden Ring menus through er-input-harness's command file, and read the state back
# from the product DLL's own log rather than from guesswork.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# Every step of the first successful drive (2026-09-11) was retyped by hand, and two of them were
# wrong in ways that cost far more than the typing:
#
#   * the command file is a queue keyed on a sequence number, and the number must parse as one.
#     `300d` does not. Three commands written with hex-ish sequences were silently ignored and read
#     as "the input channel does not work".
#   * `resource='02_000_IngameTop'` is not a state oracle at all. It is repeat-suppressed, so it sits
#     unchanged in the log while the menu moves underneath it. A confirm that had worked was read as
#     a confirm that had not, and the drive was nearly abandoned on that reading. The state oracle is
#     `optionsetting-rows: active tab=N`, which this script reads.
#
# Usage
# -----
#   scripts/er-harness-drive.sh send 'key 0x12 12'   one command, waits for the harness to run it
#   scripts/er-harness-drive.sh tab                  the System menu's active tab, or 'none'
#   scripts/er-harness-drive.sh log [n]              the last n harness repl lines
#
# The sequence number lives in a file beside the command file, so consecutive `send`s cannot collide
# and a caller never has to track it.
#
# The drive that works, measured 2026-09-11 on a live session, in-world to the Quit tab:
#
#   send 'key 0x1 10'        Escape  -- opens 02_000_IngameTop, highlighting Equipment (cell 0)
#   send 'key 0xc8 6'        Up      -- wraps the column to System (cell 6); read it back with 'grid'
#   send 'key 0x12 10'       E       -- confirm; the System menu opens on Game Options, tab 0
#   send 'key 0x2c 8'        Z       -- tab left, wrapping 0 -> 8, which is the Quit tab
#
# Keys that are not what they look like, each one measured here rather than guessed:
#   0x10  Q   closes the menu outright. It is back/cancel, not tab-left.
#   0x1a 0x1b 0xc9 0xd1 0x0f   brackets, page up/down, Tab -- all no-ops on the tab strip.
#   force 0x2b / 0x34 / 0x16 / 0x0d-0x10   the menu-code query the surface polls; none switch tabs.
#   pad / padsweep   refuse with 'no menu pad device observed yet'. A controller can be present on
#                    the host and still never be observed by the game, so this channel is not a
#                    fallback for the keyboard one.
#
# The tab strip wraps, so one Z from tab 0 is the whole journey -- eight presses of the other
# direction reach the same place and are eight more chances to land on the wrong tab.
#
# The Quit tab is a 2x2 grid, not a list. Save Game starts highlighted:
#
#     [Save Game]         [Return to Desktop]
#     [Load Character]    [Load Character from File]
#
# So from the opening position Down reaches Load Character, not Return to Desktop; Return to
# Desktop is one Right. The cell indices match the row table the product logs
# ('system-quit-dup: cloned Quit rows ... row table [Save Game=#0 Return to Desktop=#1
# Load Character=#2 Load Character from File=#3]'), so the grid is numbered across then down.
#
#   send 'key 0xcd 6'        Right   -- Save Game -> Return to Desktop
#   send 'key 0xd0 6'        Down    -- Save Game -> Load Character
#   send 'key 0xc8 6'        Up
#   send 'key 0xcb 6'        Left
