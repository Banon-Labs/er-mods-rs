"""Keep the ELDEN RING window focused while an agent-driven run needs input to reach the game.

Why. ER only accepts input while its window has focus. Measured on run br-20260905-031000-5ac5:
the product's move-probe wrote the forward stick into the live pad device for 150 frames, the
character moved for 5, `oracle_can_move` stayed False, and the window was mapped and visible on
DP-1 with `focusHistoryID = 2` -- i.e. not focused. The product's movement proof is one-shot per
load epoch (it gives up at ~900 frames and switches the probe off), so focusing the window after
it has already given up does nothing: focus has to be held from the moment the window appears.

This is the stop-gap. The durable fix is a shell that removes the focus requirement inside the
game; while that does not exist, an agent-driven run has to actually own the focus.

PRIVACY: the window is located by class only (`steam_app_1245620`). AGENTS.md forbids enumerating
or printing the user's window list, so nothing about any other window is read or reported.
