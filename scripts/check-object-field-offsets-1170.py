"""Make ELDEN RING 1.16.2 -> 1.17 STRUCT-FIELD drift loud instead of silent.

THE FAILURE CLASS THIS EXISTS FOR
---------------------------------
The 1.17 migration has three ways to be wrong about an address and only two of them speak:

  * a stale DETOUR target      -> `er-hook` refuses it and logs `HOOK REFUSED`;
  * an unmapped CALL/data RVA  -> the resolver returns 0 and the caller says so;
  * a stale STRUCT FIELD OFFSET -> `*(this + 0xNN)` quietly returns the NEIGHBOURING field.

The third has no refusal, no fault and no log line. It returns a plausible value of the right
width, forever. This gate is the missing alarm for it.

WHAT IT MEASURES, AND WHY THIS METHOD
-------------------------------------
Not a displacement census. A census answers "which offsets does the image read off this object",
which cannot say WHICH FIELD lives at an offset -- every interior byte of a big nested member is
witnessed too -- and it cannot see a move at all when both the old and new offsets happen to be
read somewhere. It produces plausible-looking wrong answers and they feel like confirmation.

This gate instead ALIGNS ONE FUNCTION'S TWO BODIES (scripts/pair-object-field-drift.py). When the
instruction sequences agree except for memory displacements, the code did not change, so
instruction k in 1.16.2 and instruction k in 1.17 are the SAME access to the SAME field -- and a
displacement difference is that field moving, by exactly that much. Each row below names the
witness function pair that produced its number.

WHAT WAS MEASURED (2026-08-31), AND THE CORRECTION IT CARRIES
--------------------------------------------------------------
`CS::PlayerGameData` grew 8 bytes in NET SIZE (0xae8 -> 0xaf0), but its fields did NOT all move by
8, and the difference is exactly the kind that a mechanical "+8 above the insertion" fix gets
wrong. 1.17 inserted ONE four-byte slot at 0x960 (a new byte field plus padding, in front of what
was `damage_negation_physical`). The 0x118-byte stat sub-object that used to start at 0x960 now
starts at 0x964 and is otherwise BYTE-IDENTICAL (its own constructor aligns with zero moved
offsets), so it ends at 0xa7c instead of 0xa78; the pointer member that follows needs 8-byte
alignment, so it lands at 0xa80 rather than 0xa7c. Hence:

    [0x000, 0x960)   held        e.g. equipment 0x2b0, face_data 0x760, is_main_player 0x8f0
    [0x960, 0xa78)   +4          e.g. resistance_gauges 0x9c8 -> 0x9cc
    [0xa78, 0xae8)   +8          e.g. scadutree override 0xab4 -> 0xabc

What the new field at 0x960 IS was established independently, from the other end: 1.17 also adds
`CS::MoveMapStep::_UpdateHorseType` (commit "The insertion was benign", bd er-effects-rs-xci9),
which re-applies the mount after a map move and reads `PlayerGameData+0x960` to make that
idempotent. Two derivations that share no evidence -- a constructor alignment here, a new callee
read there -- land on the same byte.

`FD4::FD4PadDevice` did not move a byte, and settling it took correcting its OWNER first. The
census left exactly one offset that was both WRITTEN THROUGH and unsettled -- `VK_ARRAY_88_OFFSET`
in the input harness -- attributed to `CS::CSInGamePad`, a class that yields 2 usable paired bodies
out of 40. It is not that class. All four call sites of the array's only writer (1.16.2
0x1426634a0, `mov byte [rcx+rdx*2+0x88],1`) compute `rcx` as `*(FD4PadManager + 0x18 + dev*8)` =
`padDevices[dev]`, and `FD4PadManager::Init` fills that array with `HeapAlloc(0x3c0)` +
`FD4PadDevice::FD4PadDevice` + `FD4PadDevice::vftable`. With the owner right, the measurement is
easy and 0x88 holds. The CSInGamePad is one indirection away: it HOLDS the device at its own +0x10.

That correction was not cosmetic. The harness had been writing `0x88 + (id-1000)*2` onto the
CSInGamePad, which is `HeapAlloc(0x98)` = 152 bytes, so every id from 1008 up wrote past the end of
a live game allocation.

`CS::PlayerIns` did NOT grow at all: 8 bytes were inserted in (0x398, 0x3a8] and 8 bytes REMOVED
in (0x560, 0x580], so the band between them shifts +8 while the object size is unchanged and both
ends hold. A "+8 above the insertion" rule applied here would have corrupted
`PLAYER_INS_SESSION_MANAGER_PLAYER_ENTRY_OFFSET` = 0x6b8, which is witnessed HELD twice.

THE OTHER HALF OF THE QUESTION: WHICH OBJECT
--------------------------------------------
Everything above is about where a FIELD sits, and for a READ that is the whole question. For a
WRITE it is the smaller half. A wrong offset returns the neighbouring member; a wrong OBJECT
corrupts the heap, and until 2026-08-31 nothing in this tree checked the second thing.

The bug that proved it: `stamp_vk_direct` wrote `object + 0x88 + (id - 1000) * 2` for ids up to
1080 -- byte 0x128 -- into what it believed was a `CS::CSInGamePad`, which is `HeapAlloc(0x98)` =
152 bytes. The offset 0x88 was right and had not moved. The class was wrong. It never fired only
because the TypeID needles were `.data` RVAs with no 1.17 mapping, which is a reason it was never
observed, not a reason it was safe.

So `ALLOC_WITNESSES` pins each written-into object by the two facts that can refute a
misattribution: the literal the game's own allocator is called with, and an identity anchor in the
same decoded window -- the constructor that allocation is handed to, or the vtable it is stamped
with. `WRITE_REACH` then recomputes, from the repo's OWN live literals, the highest byte this
repo's writes can reach in that object, and fails if it is not inside. Raising a bound (a slot
count, a virtual-key ceiling, a field offset) now fails here instead of at the far end of a
`HeapAlloc`.

Two of the measured objects have almost no slack, which is why the reach is computed rather than
eyeballed: `CS::ProfileSummary` is `0x18 + 10 * 0x2a0 = 0x1a58` and the repo's record writes reach
its final byte EXACTLY (slot 10 would overrun by a whole 0x2a0 record, and only a `slot <
PROFILE_SUMMARY_SLOT_COUNT` clamp stands in the way), and `CS::MoveMapStep` writes 0x4b8 of a
0x4c0 object -- seven bytes to spare.

WHAT THE GATE ASSERTS
---------------------
  1. IMAGE half -- every frozen witness row re-measures to the same pair, live, from the two
     de-Arxan'd images. A row that cannot be measured is a FAILURE, not a pass: nine "audits" in
     this repo have reported zero findings from a matcher that had gone blind.
  2. SOURCE half -- each repo constant that names a field of these two objects still holds the
     1.16.2 literal this gate verified, at the file and line where it lives. A constant derived
     from `offset_of!`/`size_of!` carries no literal at its definition, so its `const _: () =
     assert!(NAME == 0x..)` counts as the pin -- otherwise the whole `CS::ProfileSummary` typed
     layout would sit unwatched behind an expression.
  3. OBJECT half -- every allocation size above re-decodes to the same literal in BOTH images and
     is still tied to its class by a constructor call or a vtable reference within the same
     window, and no repo write reaches past it. Unmeasurable is a failure here too: a size
     instruction that no longer decodes says nothing about whether a write fits.
  4. THE LATENT ONE, which is the reason to have a gate rather than a report. 44 sites compute
     `offset_of!(PlayerGameData, ...)` against the sibling `fromsoftware-rs` binding, which is a
     1.16.2 model. Every field referenced TODAY sits below 0x960, so nothing is wrong -- but the
     mechanism looks maximally trustworthy (the compiler computed it) and is one added field
     reference away from silently reading a neighbour. So: any `offset_of!(PlayerGameData, X)`
     whose field is not in the verified-and-below-the-boundary set fails the build.

USAGE
    python3 scripts/check-object-field-offsets-1170.py
    python3 scripts/check-object-field-offsets-1170.py --selftest   # prove it can go red
    ER_DEOBF_1162=... ER_DEOBF_1170=... python3 scripts/check-object-field-offsets-1170.py

The IMAGE half skips when the two images are absent (they are gitignored game-derived binaries);
the SOURCE half always runs, and `--selftest` REQUIRES the images so a green selftest can never
mean "the image half never ran".

WIRED INTO `scripts/check.sh` on 2026-08-31, beside its sibling `check-singleton-field-offsets.py`.
Until then it ran nowhere, which is why the paragraph below could happen at all: a gate that no
suite invokes catches nothing, however good its rows are. The plain run takes a few seconds; the
`--selftest` re-aligns every frozen row once per perturbation and takes minutes, so only the plain
run is in the suite and the selftest is left to `scripts/audit-selftest-vacuity.py` and to
deliberate operator runs, the same split `check.sh` uses for other slow selftests.

THE OTHER HALF OF THE QUESTION, ADDED 2026-08-31: WAS IT EVER RIGHT
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Every row above this date asks "did 1.17 move this field". `CS::CSSystemStep` asks the question
that comes first and had been skipped everywhere: is the declared offset a field of that object in
EITHER build. `CS_SYSTEM_STEP_CURRENT_STATE_OFFSET` was 0x40 from its introduction; the object's
constructor writes 0x48 and never 0x40, and 0x40 holds a live `DLAllocator*`. So
`oracle_system_step_label` read a pointer's low half, missed its `0..=20` range test and printed
`"?"` with `oracle_system_step_state = -95247096` on every run, on 1.16.2 as well as 1.17 -- a
legal i32 out of a legal read, with no fault, no log line and no drift for a drift check to see.

That is a second failure mode, not a variant of the first, and the fix for it is the same
measurement pointed at a different question: the row freezes 0x48 -> 0x48 (HELD) AND the source
half pins the repo constant to 0x48, so a constant that was never measured now cannot be
introduced -- pinning it requires producing a witness function whose two bodies agree on it.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE OBJECT, NOT JUST THE OFFSET.
#
# Everything above measures where a FIELD sits. That is the wrong half of the question for a
# WRITE. A wrong offset misinforms -- `*(this + 0xNN)` returns the neighbouring member. A wrong
# OBJECT corrupts the heap: `stamp_vk_direct` wrote `object + 0x88 + (id - 1000) * 2` for ids up to
# 1080, which reaches byte 0x128, into an object that turned out to be `HeapAlloc(0x98)` = 152
# bytes. The offset 0x88 was correct and had not moved. The class was wrong, and nothing in this
# tree checked the class.
#
# So each row below pins an object this repo writes into by the only two facts that can refute a
# misattribution:
#
#   * ITS SIZE -- the literal operand of the allocation the game makes for it, re-decoded from
#     BOTH images every run. Not Ghidra's inferred `getStructure` size, which is an analysis
#     guess: the number the allocator is actually called with.
#   * ITS IDENTITY -- an anchor within the same decoded window tying that allocation to THIS
#     class: the constructor the allocation is handed to, or the vtable it is stamped with. A size
#     without an identity anchor is just a number at an address, and an address is exactly what
#     was wrong last time.
#
# `WRITE_REACH` below then asserts the arithmetic that actually matters: the highest byte this
# repo's writes can reach in that object, recomputed from the repo's own live literals, is inside
# the measured allocation. Two of these have almost no slack (`CS::ProfileSummary` reaches its
# final byte exactly; `CS::MoveMapStep` leaves 7 bytes), which is the whole reason to compute the
# reach rather than eyeball it.
