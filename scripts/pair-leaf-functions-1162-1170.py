"""Pair the LEAF functions of ELDEN RING 1.16.2 with their 1.17 counterparts.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Every cross-build function pairing in this repo descends from `.pdata`
(`scripts/build-1162-1170-function-map.py` walks the exception directory of both
images and matches RUNTIME_FUNCTION records by masked signature).  `.pdata` holds
one record per function *with unwind data*, and the x64 ABI lets a function omit
unwind data entirely when it allocates no stack and calls nothing.  So the
128,602-pair map -- and therefore every drift statement built on it -- contains
**no leaf functions at all**.

That is not a theoretical hole.  A leaf is exactly the shape of a field getter,
and `GetScadutreeBlessing` (1.16.2 `0x14025f5f0`) is this migration's one
confirmed ground-truth field move: `[rcx+0xab5] -> [rcx+0xabd]`.  It has no
`.pdata` record on either side, so no sweep in this repo has ever looked at it.
"N of 553 offsets cleared" was silent about the whole leaf population.

WHAT A PAIRING RESTS ON, STRONGEST FIRST
----------------------------------------
1. `CALLER-VOTE` -- the leaf is reached by a direct `call`/`jmp` from a function
   this repo has ALREADY paired, at a byte offset that is identical on both
   sides of an identically-shaped body.  The caller pins the callee: it composes
   with the existing map instead of re-deriving it, and it is the only evidence
   here that does not look at the leaf's own bytes.  Its own correctness is
   measurable, because most vote targets are NOT leaves -- they are ordinary
   `.pdata` functions whose pairing `functions.tsv` already states.  Agreement on
   those is the positive control (`--audit-votes`).
2. `BYTE-IDENTICAL` -- the two bodies are equal byte for byte over an extent
   decoded by the shared `leaf_extent` rule, and that byte string is unique among
   the leaves of both images.
3. `MASKED-SIG` -- equal after `scripts/map-rvas-1162-to-1170.py`'s masking of
   rip-relative displacements and immediates, unique on both sides.  This is the
   rung that pairs `GetScadutreeBlessing`, whose only difference IS the field
   displacement.
4. `BRACKET` -- a masked signature that matched but was NOT unique, disambiguated
   by lying between the same two already-paired anchors on both sides.

A leaf no rung reaches is `UNPAIRED`, and stays that way.  Bracketing is only ever
a tie-break between shape-equal candidates: position alone never pairs anything
here, because a confident wrong pairing reads downstream as a live value and
corrupts silently, while a missing one only costs coverage.

WHAT POISONS THIS AND HOW IT IS AVOIDED
---------------------------------------
* **Padding.** MSVC pads with `int3` (0xCC) *or* `nop` (0x90) and does not make
  the same choice in two builds.  Any extent that runs into inter-function
  padding desyncs at the first pad byte and everything after compares unequal.
  Extents come from `scripts/verify-rva-map-1170.py::leaf_extent`, imported, not
  copied -- it stops at the terminator and never includes padding.
* **Joining on a number instead of an object.** The drift pass below reports a
  displacement move only PER BASE REGISTER inside one aligned pair, never "some
  function somewhere reads 0x50".
