"""Prove scripts/regulation-params.py imports on an interpreter with no `compression.zstd`.

WHY THIS EXISTS AS A GATE RATHER THAN A COMMENT. `compression.zstd` is stdlib only from
Python 3.14 (PEP 784). This machine runs 3.14, GitHub's ubuntu-latest does not, and the
import in regulation-params.py used to be bare -- so the failure was invisible to every
local run by construction and only ever appeared in CI. Measured on PR #388, run
33793058851: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'compression'` took down
check-moveset-table.py AND its own `--selftest`, through the import chain
check-moveset-table -> er-moveset-table-gen -> er-param-read:16 -> regulation-params:25.

A regression here cannot be caught by running the module on this box, because on this box
the import works. So the check BLINDS the interpreter instead: a `sys.meta_path` finder
that raises ModuleNotFoundError for `compression` reproduces an older interpreter's answer
exactly, on the interpreter we have. Each case runs in its own subprocess because the
blinding has to be installed before the module is first imported.

Run: python3 scripts/test-regulation-params-zstd-skip.py
