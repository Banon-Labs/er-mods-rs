"""Re-pin `crates/er-invasion-warp/build.rs` prologue bytes against a new Seamless build.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Every Seamless Co-op update forces the same chore, and doing it by hand is how a wrong byte
gets typed into a pin that then silently accepts the wrong function. The build script already
does the hard half: for each `PrologueSpec` it ASSEMBLES the named instructions with iced-x86,
compares the result against both the hand-written `pin:` array and the bytes at that VA in the
real DLL, and panics naming all three. So the correct new pin is already in the panic message.
This tool just closes the loop -- read the assembled bytes out of the failure, write them into
the array, build again, repeat until the build is green.

It is NOT a way to make a red build go green. It only ever copies the bytes the ASSEMBLER
produced, and the assembler is driven by the `va:` constants and the instruction closures in
`build.rs`. If an address in there is wrong, the assembled bytes are wrong too, the build
script's own comparison against the DLL image rejects them, and this loop stops with that
error rather than papering over it. Fix the addresses first (see
`scripts/locate-ersc-entry-points.py`, and identify every candidate independently -- a
signature match is a candidate, never an identification), then run this.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
-------------------
Touch `ERSC_SUPPORTED_VERSION`, add an `Image` variant, or change a `va:` constant. Those are
judgements about WHICH function is which; this only transcribes bytes for functions whose
identity you have already established.

USAGE
    # Point the build at the archived copy of the build you are pinning to.
    python3 scripts/repin-ersc-prologues.py \
        --ersc vendor-archive/seamless/ersc-2.0.1.dll \
        --reference vendor-archive/seamless/ersc-1.9.9.dll
    python3 scripts/repin-ersc-prologues.py --selftest

Exit status: 0 the build is green, 1 it failed for a reason this tool must not auto-fix.
