"""Propose the OWNING CLASS for each UNKNOWN-STRUCT autoload offset, from the repo's own prose.

`detect-struct-field-drift.py --report` refuses to judge a constant whose structure it cannot
name, and it can only name one when the constant is written as `offset_of!(T, f)` or its name
carries one of ten known prefixes. That leaves 422 autoload offsets untyped -- and untyped means
untested, because a clearance is only valid per NAMED OBJECT.

The type information is not actually missing: it is in the doc comment above each constant, where
the RE that produced the number was written down. This reads that prose and matches every token
in it against the RTTI class names harvested from the images themselves
(`scripts/rtti-classmap-both.py`), so a suggestion is only ever a class that DEMONSTRABLY EXISTS
in both builds -- never a guess at a name.

A suggestion is a lead, not a verdict. `scripts/clear-fields-by-object.py` is what decides.
Output: `autoload-class-suggest.json` under the drift out-dir.
