"""Prove `scripts/me3-dll-conflicts.toml` still describes every ME3-loadable DLL.

The conflict table is what stands between a generated profile and a run that is corrupt
before it starts. A table is only worth that if it cannot go quietly stale, and the way it
goes stale is not by being wrong -- it is by a new cdylib crate appearing and nobody
classifying it. The closure walk in `er-dll-closure.py` would then happily include that new
DLL next to the product with no idea whether the two can share a process.

So this gate asserts five things:

1. **Coverage.** Every package in the `me3_shells` array (the single source of truth for
   "which cdylibs does this workspace ship", parsed via `me3-dll-list.py`) is classified --
   either it appears in at least one `[[conflict]]` pair, or it is listed in `[compatible]`.
2. **Reasons exist.** Both a `reason` and an `evidence` field on every conflict, and a
   non-empty reason for every compatible entry. "No conflict" must be a finding someone
   made, not a default a forgotten crate inherits.
3. **No dead entries.** Every package named anywhere in the table is still a shipped shell,
   so a rename or a crate-type change cannot leave the table pointing at nothing.
4. **No double classification.** A package in a `[[conflict]]` pair must not also claim to
   be `[compatible]`, which would let the closure walk read whichever it liked.
5. **`[[shared]]` rows are checkable.** A `[[shared]]` pair is the one thing that licenses two
   DLLs to detour ONE prologue and still share a profile, so it must carry the `target`, the
   `mechanism`, and BOTH handler symbols -- those are what `check-shared-hook-rvas.py` uses to
   prove each detour reaches a union registrar and never an `MhHook::new`. A pair may not be
   declared shared and conflicting at once: the closure walk reads `[[conflict]]` only, and would
   co-load a pair it had been told to keep apart.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check-me3-dll-conflicts.py
    python3 scripts/check-me3-dll-conflicts.py --selftest

Exit status is 1 on any failure, so this can gate.
