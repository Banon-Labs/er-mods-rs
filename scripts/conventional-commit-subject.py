"""Is this one line a Conventional Commits subject? The single place that answers it.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. `.github/workflows/release.yml` has run Release Please since it was
written, and Release Please reads `feat:`/`fix:` prefixes off main to decide the next version. It
has never had any to read: measured 2026-09-03, 15 of the last 400 subjects on main match the
convention and none of the recent ones do, which is why `.release-please-manifest.json` still says
0.1.6. The repo was carrying a release mechanism whose input nothing produced.

WHY THE ENFORCEMENT IS ON A PR TITLE AND NOT ON A COMMIT MESSAGE. The obvious server-side answer --
a repository ruleset with a `commit_message_pattern` rule -- does NOT work, and it fails silently
rather than loudly. Measured on this repo, 2026-09-03: `POST /repos/{r}/rulesets` accepts the rule
and returns 201 listing it, and with that rule ACTIVE on a probe branch requiring
`^(feat|fix|chore|...): `, both of these still succeeded --

    POST /repos/{r}/merges   commit_message="Merge pull request #999 from ..."   -> 201, sha 0f61506
    PUT  /repos/{r}/contents message="junk message that violates the rule"       -> 201

-- so GitHub does not apply metadata rules to commits it creates server-side, which is every commit
the merge button makes. (GitHub's current "Available rules for rulesets" page no longer documents
metadata restrictions at all; treat the rule type as retired-but-accepted.) The lever that DOES
hold is the pull request TITLE: with the repo's `merge_commit_title` set to `PR_TITLE` (flipped
2026-09-03, from `MERGE_MESSAGE`, which is what produced five months of `Merge pull request #N
from ...` subjects), the PR title BECOMES the merge commit's subject, and a required status check
on that title gates the merge button before the commit exists.

So one regex has three consumers and they must not drift apart:

    scripts/hooks/commit-msg                     every local commit, before it exists
    .github/workflows/conventional-commits.yml   the PR title, as a required check
    .github/workflows/conventional-commits.yml   HEAD's subject after a push to main

The third is the one that catches a human editing the merge dialog's textarea, which no server-side
rule can prevent -- it is detective, not preventive, and it says so where it runs.

    python3 scripts/conventional-commit-subject.py --subject "feat: add a thing"
    python3 scripts/conventional-commit-subject.py --file .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
    python3 scripts/conventional-commit-subject.py --selftest
