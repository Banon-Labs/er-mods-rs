"""Read, scan and write a running ELDEN RING's memory from outside the process.

Why this exists, and why it is not frida. Frida cannot bootstrap into this target: three attempts on
2026-09-05 produced three different failures, ending at `ptrace pokedata: Input/output error`. That
was never a permissions problem -- measured on the live game (pid 2266653, ER 1.17 under Proton):

    /proc/<pid>/mem  open O_RDONLY -> OK
    /proc/<pid>/mem  open O_RDWR   -> OK
    PTRACE_ATTACH                  -> 0

so this process can already read and write the game's address space directly. Frida's ptrace-based
agent injection is a means to that end, and the end is available without it.

What this replaces. Every live question used to cost a Rust verb in `er-input-harness`'s REPL, a
cross-compile and a relaunch -- "teach me a new input" and "rebuild the DLL" were the same act. Scans
and reads do not need to be either: they are a seek and a read on a file descriptor.

What it deliberately does not do. It writes memory only when asked with `poke`, and driving game
input is not what it is for: the input path is the DirectInput keyboard buffer, which the game refills
every frame, so an outside write races it and loses. Input still belongs in the in-process stamp.
Reading state -- which grid is the cursor, what is its cell, did that press land -- is what this owns.

    scripts/er-live-poke.py --pid N scan 0x142a94438        every address holding that qword
