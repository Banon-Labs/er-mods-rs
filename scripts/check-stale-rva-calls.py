"""Ratchet on game addresses that are CALLED without asking where they live on this build.

Every game RVA in this workspace was reverse-engineered against ELDEN RING 1.16.2. On 2026-08-27
the game shipped 1.17 and moved the code. Two things then had to be gated, and only one was:

  DETOURS      `er-hook` resolves the address before installing, translating it when a mapping is
               verified and refusing when it is not. Done, and it turned a boot-killing crash into
               log lines.
  DIRECT CALLS `transmute(base + SOME_RVA)` builds a function pointer and calls it. Nothing looks
               at it. On a moved build this transfers control into whatever now occupies those
               bytes -- routinely the middle of an unrelated function, which faults with no unwind
               information and no exception record naming anything of ours. It is the WORSE of the
               two: a refused detour makes one feature inert and says so, while a stale call takes
               the process down and leaves a backtrace pointing into game code.

The fix per site is `er_game_base::mem::game_rva`, which translates or returns `Err`. Converting
them is ordinary work; what this gate exists to stop is the set GROWING while that happens. It is
a ratchet, not a freeze: removing sites is free, adding one is refused, and `--refresh` accepts a
new baseline as a reviewable diff rather than as an invisible default.

The key is (file, constant), not a line number, so ordinary edits do not churn the baseline.

WHAT THIS GATE COULD NOT SEE UNTIL 2026-08-30, and what it recorded instead:

  IT READ PROSE.       The matcher ran over raw file text, so a `//` paragraph explaining the
                       hazard and a `///` doc comment saying a call "used to be a bare
                       `transmute(base + SOME_RVA)`" were both recorded as call sites. TWO OF THE
                       THREE BASELINE ROWS WERE THAT. A ratchet whose baseline holds non-findings
                       stays green while real sites appear beside them, and the next agent to
                       shrink it edits a sentence. Comments and string bodies are now blanked
                       before matching, and the baseline was re-derived from scratch rather than
                       having the two rows deleted -- a baseline is only meaningful if every row
                       in it is a real finding someone consciously accepted.
  IT TRUSTED NAMES.    It required the constant to be spelled `*RVA*`. Forty ungated transmutes in
                       `er-build-import-runtime` were named `GET_MAIN_PLAYER_STATS` and the like,
                       or imported under aliases that strip the suffix, so the gate whose entire
                       job was to find them could never match one. The name filter is gone; the
                       arithmetic is the evidence.
  ...WHICH THEN        Dropping the name filter admitted seven `base + PE_DOS_LFANEW_OFFSET`
  ADMITTED A NEW CLASS reads of the DOS header's `0x3c` field. Those are excluded by VALUE -- below
                       `.text`, so fixed by the PE format and unable to move -- and never by name,
                       and a constant that cannot be resolved is KEPT rather than assumed safe.
  IT COULD NOT READ    `own_stepper_idx10_fallbacks!` receives the module base as a metavariable, so
  A MACRO BODY.        every call inside it is spelled `transmute($base + SOME_RVA)`. One `$` was
                       enough to hide `TITLE_TOP_DIALOG_IS_IN_STATE_RVA`, a function that moved
                       0x749b20 -> 0x74a970 and left the 1.16.2 address mid-instruction -- a LIVE
                       1.17 crash the gate reported as absent while it stood.
  IT ASSUMED A         `er-title-flow` keeps most of its addresses in C-like enums, so the call
  CONSTANT IS          reads `base + ProfileLoadMenuRva::ProfileLoadSelectSaveSlot as usize`, and
  SCREAMING_SNAKE.     other crates reach one through its module (`jp::GAME_MAN_GLOBAL_RVA`).
                       Neither is SCREAMING_SNAKE at the use site. That hid a second live call
                       (0x9a5f20 -> 0x9a70c0) and six raw global reads. Both spellings now match,
                       keyed on the LAST path segment so a rewritten `use` does not churn the
                       baseline.
  IT LOOKED IN ONLY    ...and this is the one that mattered most, because it was invisible from
  THREE CONTEXTS.      BOTH sides. The three patterns above are `transmute(base + C)`,
                       `safe_read_*(base + C)` and `== base + C`. Anywhere else a named constant
                       was added to a module base -- inside a `format_args!`, as a bare `let`, as
                       an argument, as a row of an install table -- this gate matched nothing.
                       `check-oracle-singleton-globals.py` did not cover the gap either: it sees
                       every OTHER right-hand side, and on an uppercase one it `continue`s,
                       DELEGATING the site here. The pair was described as a partition of the
                       class for a fortnight. MEASURED 2026-08-31 instead of asserted: 37 sites
                       reached that delegation and this gate reported `0 known ungated site(s)`,
                       so every one of them was reported by NEITHER.

                       Twenty-two were `format_args!` log lines naming a 1.16.2 address on the
                       one branch whose entire subject is that addresses moved --
                       `title_scaleform_msgbox.rs:361` printed `base + POLICY_TOS_TITLE_CTOR_RVA`
                       directly above a correctly resolved `game_data_addr` call inside the SAME
                       `format_args!`, so the line named an address the code never touched. That
                       is not a crash; it is a diagnostic that confidently sends the next reader
                       to the wrong function, which during a migration is most of the cost.

                       So the ADDITION is now matched wherever it appears. The three contexts
                       above stay as they were -- unconditional, because a transmuted call, a
                       read and a comparison are hazards whatever else the file says -- and the
                       fourth, general pattern carries the exclusions those three did not need:
                       is `base` actually the game module base (decided from its BINDING), and
                       does the sum reach an API that resolves it? Both questions are answered by
                       `scripts/module_base_arith.py`, which this gate and its sibling now share
                       so the two can no longer disagree about which sites either owns.

Both were found the same way the earlier two were: by reading the source directly instead of
trusting this gate's silence. It reported `1 known ungated site(s), none new` throughout.

#
# Both patterns below used to require `[A-Z0-9_]*RVA[A-Z0-9_]*`, on the reasoning that `_RVA` is
# this workspace's naming convention for a 1.16.2 address and is "what makes the set findable at
# all". It is not. What makes a site a stale call is the ARITHMETIC -- a module base plus a
# compile-time constant, transmuted and called -- and the arithmetic does not care what the
# constant is spelled. Two spellings defeated the old filter outright:
#
#   * constants that never carried the suffix. `er-build-import-runtime` calls
#     `GET_MAIN_PLAYER_STATS`, `EQUIP_ITEM_TO_CHR_ASM_SLOT` and thirty-eight more by those names.
#   * constants that HAD the suffix and lost it at the import. `use ...::FOO_RVA as FOO;` renames
#     the address at the use site, which is exactly where this gate looks.
#
# Forty ungated sites in one crate were invisible to a gate whose entire purpose was to find them,
# and it reported `3 known ungated site(s), none new` while they were being written. So the name
# filter is gone: any SCREAMING_SNAKE identifier added to a module base is a candidate. That admits
# a genuinely version-independent constant, which is what the baseline and the "say so at the call
# site" escape hatch are for -- a false positive costs a line of review, and this false NEGATIVE
# cost forty.
#
# NOR IS ITS SHAPE (widened again 2026-08-30). SCREAMING_SNAKE is not the only spelling an address
# constant has here. `er-title-flow` collects them into C-like enums and writes the address as
# `ProfileLoadMenuRva::ProfileLoadSelectSaveSlot as usize`, and other crates reach a constant
# through its module (`jp::GAME_MAN_GLOBAL_RVA`, `ersc::SHOW_RVA`). Both are `base + <constant>`
# arithmetic and neither matched a SCREAMING_SNAKE-only pattern -- which is how
# `transmute(base + ProfileLoadMenuRva::ProfileLoadSelectSaveSlot as usize)` sat in
# `profile_dialog_select_save_slot` calling 1.16.2's 0x9a5f20 on a build where that function had
# moved to 0x9a70c0 and the old address was mid-instruction. So a path qualifier and a trailing
# `as usize` are both accepted, and the LAST path segment is what the baseline is keyed on so the
# key stays stable if a `use` is rewritten.

#
# The three failures are not the same failure. A stale CALL kills the process and leaves a
# backtrace. A stale READ returns plausible nonsense that surfaces somewhere else, later. A stale
# COMPARISON does nothing at all: `observed_vtable == base + MOVED_RVA` is simply false forever,
# so the classifier behind it answers "no" to every object it is shown and the feature it gates is
# absent -- with no fault, no refusal line, and no counter moving. Perfect silence is the one
# outcome `resolve_game_address` was written to make impossible, and the comparison form walked
# straight past it because nothing about `==` looks like a call.
#
# MEASURED, all on 1.17, all found by reading the source rather than by this gate: the Scaleform
# `MemoryFile` vtable (0x2ba4c80 -> 0x2ba7d70) matched no File, so both DLLs' `.gfx` swaps stopped;
# `MenuTitleContinue::_Do_call` (0x764b80 -> 0x7659d0) matched no functor at four separate hooks,
# so the autoload never identified the Continue row; `CS::SceneObjProxy`'s vtable
# (0x2a94a70 -> 0x2a97af0) made product-core readiness report BLOCKER_PRESS_START forever.
#
# THE OTHER HALF OF THE RULE, which this pattern cannot check and a reviewer must: the resolved
# side has to be screened against ZERO before it is compared. `game_data_addr` answers 0 for a
# refusal -- harmless as a read target, and as a COMPARISON target it makes `x == 0` true for every
# unset field, which is worse than never matching. `dispatch_target_is_purecall` and
