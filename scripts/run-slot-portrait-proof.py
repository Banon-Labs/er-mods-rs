"""Prove (or refute) the different-slot loading-screen PORTRAIT with RAM semaphores.

TARGET DEFECT (user 2026-07-30): a System->Quit->Load-Profile switch to a DIFFERENT slot of the
same save deterministically displayed NO rendered character portrait. Root cause (run
20260730-202840 + code): `patch_profile_offscreen_size_for_loaded_slot` resolved the CONFIRMED
LOADED slot, which still names the OLD character during the switch, so the incoming slot's
offscreen-size row stayed native 128 (x2 supersample = 256x256 captures) for every renderer built
in the switch window; the small-capture publish gate then rejected all of them -> nothing displayed
(and before that gate, the same 256 captures published -> the pixelated/naked portrait reports).

This driver validates the fix END TO END, fully agent-driven (no menu nav, no input):
  load1 = the configured boot autoload (game-dir er-effects.toml, untouched by this script);
  load2 = the product's own deterministic control file (er-effects-switch-slot.txt), the same
          code path the user's ProfileSelect click reaches (switch_slot_arm_programmatic).

PASS semaphores for the load2 window (all RAM/native, screenshots are user evidence only):
  - oracle_ls_portrait_w/h >= 1024 (expect 1542) on captures seen during the window
  - oracle_portrait_onto_draw_hits delta > 0 (the portrait actually composited)
  - oracle_ls_portrait_rejects_after_window_publish delta == 0. NOT "zero rejects": the only reject
    reason is a >=90%-blank frame, and refusing one is the neutral gate WORKING. Run
    20260731-130803 saw the neutral leak at capture version 1 and refused 2 of 1542 frames while
    all 1540 publishes were clean -- warm-up, yet the old `rejected_delta == 0` failed it. A reject
    AFTER a clean publish is the real defect: the pipeline began emitting blanks mid-window.
  - published identity oracle_ls_portrait_slot == target_slot + 1
  - oracle_ls_portrait_renderer_visible_armor_equipped > 0 when the source has armor (not nude)

ALSO REPORTED (er-effects-rs-wmw defect #1, the vanilla flash-through): per-switch
`native_exposure_delta` = Present frames where the game's own CS::LoadingScreen was live but our
cover did not draw -- the frames the user sees vanilla. Reported, not gated, so the portrait
verdict and the flash-through stay independently readable.

Event screenshot: scripts/capture-er-window.py fires at the loading-screen-portrait moment
(protocol: the exact view where the USER can see whether the feature is failing). The agent never
reads the image; it is user evidence.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/run-slot-portrait-proof.py --switch-slot 1 [--label fix1]
