"""Ask the call-graph topology map about the 1.16.2 addresses this workspace still cannot map.

Collects every game ADDRESS declared under `crates/`, subtracts the ledgers that
already answer one (`rva-map-1162-to-1170.functions.tsv`, `.verified.tsv`, `.needed.tsv`,
`.tsv`), and reports what the topology pairing says about the remainder -- with the rule and the
tier that carried it, because a LOOSE-tier row measured 12-18% wrong and must never be used.

WHAT "EVERY ADDRESS" USED TO MEAN, and why it was fewer than it sounded (fixed 2026-08-30)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The collector was one regex requiring a SCREAMING_SNAKE name containing `RVA`, one of three
types, and a hex literal on the spot. THE LIST THIS TOOL PRODUCES IS THE LIST OF ADDRESSES THAT
GET MAPPED, so every spelling it could not read was an address that silently never got a 1.17
row -- and then refused at runtime with nothing to say why. Four spellings it could not read:

    MenuJobWait = 0x00b0d400,                     an enum discriminant (er-title-flow keeps most
                                                  of its addresses this way)
    const FILE_OPEN_RVA: usize = other::FOO_RVA;  derived, so no literal is present here
    const GAME_HEAP_ALLOC_VA: usize = 0x141eb9ed0; a VA. The old collector read it as an RVA and
                                                  then added the image base AGAIN, asking the
                                                  topology about 0x2801eb9ed0 -- an address in
                                                  no image at all
    const LONG_RVA: usize =\n    0x9af3a0;        the literal on the next line

Values now come from `scripts/rva_symbols.py`, which resolves all of them, and a VA is folded onto
its RVA.

WHAT COUNTS AS AN ADDRESS, stated because dropping the name filter needs a replacement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not every integer constant is a game address; asking the topology about `BOOT_PUMP_MAX_MS` is
noise. A declaration is collected when its value could be an RVA at all -- at or above the end of
the PE headers, below the image size -- AND one of three things is true of it:

  * it is NAMED like an address (`*RVA*`, `*_VA`), this tree's convention;
  * it is USED like an address: `base + X`, `game_rva(X)`, `game_data_addr(base, X, ..)`,
    `X.checked_add(..)`. What the code does with it is stronger evidence than what it is called;
  * its value is the 1.16.2 SOURCE of a row in one of the curated maps, which is a direct
    statement by an earlier pass that this number is a game address.

The third is required to be >= 0x100000: below that a small round number collides with a real
address by accident rather than by being one (`0x1000` is a curated row AND a texture dimension
cap in `boot_progress.rs`).
