"""Every workflow that checks out `fromsoftware-rs` must agree on BOTH halves of the pin.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Three workflows clone the upstream sibling and check out a fixed revision.
Two of them carried the comment "Keep in lockstep with .github/workflows/check.yml" and then
copied only HALF of what check.yml says: the `FROMSOFTWARE_RS_REV`, but not the
`FROMSOFTWARE_RS_REMOTE` that names the remote the rev actually exists on. The pinned
`1027d24` (the Elden Ring 2.7.0.0 / patch 1.17 RVA bundle) lives ONLY on the fork -- upstream
advertises 325 refs and neither it nor its parent is reachable from any of them -- so
`git clone vswarte/... && git checkout 1027d24` dies with `fatal: unable to read tree`.

That is not a noisy failure. It happens at step 2 of ~15, so every Rust check below it reports
NOTHING: not pass, not fail. check.yml's own comment records what that blind window cost the
last time (two commits reached origin that do not compile). It cost it again on 2026-09-01,
when `release` went red on main at `b9109a30` for exactly this reason while `check` -- the one
workflow that had been fixed -- ran fine beside it.

"Keep in lockstep" was a COMMENT. A comment cannot fail. This is the same claim as an
executable rule, so the next workflow that clones the sibling cannot inherit half a pin.

RULES
  R1  every workflow that names FROMSOFTWARE_RS_REV names the SAME rev
  R2  every workflow that CLONES the sibling defines FROMSOFTWARE_RS_REMOTE, and all of them
      name the same remote
  R3  no clone line hard-codes a fromsoftware-rs URL -- it must go through the variable, or
      R2 is satisfied by a variable nothing reads

R3 is the one that actually caught the 2026-09-01 break: both broken workflows would have
passed R1 (their rev matched) and R2 is only meaningful because R3 forces the clone to use it.
