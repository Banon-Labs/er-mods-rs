"""Watch Seamless's session state machine and its option menu, live.

WHAT THIS ANSWERS
-----------------
The option table, the menu builder and the confirm hook are plaintext and fully read (2026-08-04).
Two things looked unreachable inside the Themida-virtualized `seamless_session_manager`:

  * what puts the session into state 0x15 -- the ONLY state in which "Seek opponent" appears; and
  * what consumes the opponent handle that "Seek opponent" latches.

THE FIRST ONE TURNED OUT NOT TO BE IN THE VM AT ALL (2026-08-05). An earlier pass concluded "nothing
plaintext sets 0x15" from an accessor search; that was a search artifact, not a fact. 0x15 is never
a literal ANYWHERE in the image -- it is COMPUTED, by five plain instructions at ersc+0x716e7, from
one bit. See S+0x00 below. The lesson generalises: "no immediate store of the value" is not the same
as "no plaintext writer", and a constant that is arithmetic on a flag will never appear as a literal.

The second is still unread, and is genuinely observable rather than readable: the latch is a plain
qword, so sampling it across a real session reconstructs that half from the outside.

WHAT IT WATCHES, and why each field
-----------------------------------
Everything hangs off ERSC's option-menu object, `OSM`, and its session object `S = OSM+0x58`:

  S+0x110  session state.  0 -> only "Invade world as a wanderer" is offered;
                           0x15 -> "Seek opponent" (index 0) + "Mark world" (index 1);
                           0x0D/0x0E/0x0F/0x11 -> only "Cancel search";
                           anything else -> the menu will not open at all.
           "Invade world as a wanderer" sets it to 0x0D; "Cancel search" sets 0x22 -- both as
           immediate stores. 0x15 is not stored, it is computed; see S+0x00.
  S+0x1D4  cleared to 0 by the "Seek opponent" action. One writer, zero plaintext readers.
  S+0x1F0  the CHOSEN OPPONENT'S HANDLE, latched by "Seek opponent". Zero plaintext consumers.
           This is the closest thing in the mod to "invade this specific person".
  S+0x00   THE FLAGS WORD THAT DECIDES 0x15. Found statically 2026-08-05, and it is NOT in the
           virtualized dispatcher after all -- the state is plain arithmetic on one bit, at
           ersc+0x716e7:
               mov rax,[rsp+0x30]      ; = *(u32*)S, loaded at ersc+0x71584
               shr eax,0x13            ; >> 19
               and eax,1               ; bit 19  (0x0008_0000)
               lea eax,[rax+rax*8]     ; x9
               add eax,0xc             ; +12
               mov [rdi+0x110],eax     ; 12 (0x0C) when clear, 21 (0x15) when SET
           So "Seek opponent" is offered exactly when bit 19 of S+0x00 is set. Watching that bit
           predicts the option's availability BEFORE the state byte changes, and distinguishes
           "the state machine never moved" from "the bit was never set".
  S+0x10C  update sentinel. `cmp dword [rdi+0x10c],0x7fffffff; je` at ersc+0x716db SKIPS the state
           write entirely. If state looks frozen while the flags bit flips, this is why -- so it
           is sampled rather than inferred.

WHAT IS PROVEN vs INFERRED: the derivation above is proven from the bytes. What bit 19 MEANS is
inferred from context (it sits right after a decrypt+validate of a 0x1C-byte buffer --
`xorps xmm0,[rbx]` then `call ersc+0x171f00`), which points at server-pushed state, consistent with
the destination arriving via CS::SosSignMan::SetMultiplayJoinData. Whether the bit can be
influenced from the client is UNTESTED, and this script does not try -- it only reads.

OSM is a heap allocation with no export, so it is captured rather than computed: the first call
to show() or to the confirm callback hands it over in RCX.

RVAs (module-base relative -- ersc.dll is RELOCATABLE, there is no fixed load address, so every
address is resolved against Process.findModuleByName('ersc.dll').base at runtime):
    0x22D30  show(void* OSM, int groupId)   prologue 55 41 57 41 56 41 55 41 54 56 57 53 48 81 EC
    0x806E0  confirm callback(ErscCtx* ctx, GameDialog* dlg); selected index at dlg+0xB0C
    0x243E0  action: "Invade world as a wanderer"   (sets S+0x110 = 0x0D)
    0x24BC0  action: "Seek opponent"                (latches S+0x1F0, clears S+0x1D4)
    0x24D10  action: "Mark world for other invaders"
    0x24460  action: "Cancel search"                (sets S+0x110 = 0x22)

READ-ONLY. Nothing is written and nothing in ERSC is called. The prologue of show() is verified
before hooking, so a version drift fails loudly instead of hooking the middle of some other
function.
