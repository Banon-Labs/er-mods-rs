# DOES THE CONFIG GUARD ACTUALLY CATCH A GATE THAT REWRITES THE REPOSITORY CONFIG?
#
# scripts/check-gate-config-guard.sh compares core.bare and core.hooksPath in the SHARED git dir
# before and after the gate suite, because on 2026-08-31 the suite itself flipped core.bare to true
# and unset core.hooksPath in the live checkout -- twice, silently, from a push made in a linked
# worktree (bd hooks-selftest-under-git-hook-blanks-the-live-config-2026-08-31).
#
# A guard nobody has watched fail is a guard nobody knows is wired up. This proves it in both
# directions against the REAL text: the fixture SOURCES the guard file rather than copying it, so a
# rename, a rewrite or a deletion changes this test's behaviour or stops it finding the guard at
# all -- it cannot drift into testing a stale copy of the logic. (Before 2026-09-03 the guard was
# the opening trap of scripts/ci-local-check.sh and this test copied that file's head; the hook now
# runs scripts/check.sh, the same suite CI runs, and the guard moved into its own sourced file.)
