"""A/B the profile-switch reload softlock (WorldBlockRes parks at phase 2 / mms_step=3).

ROOT CAUSE this exercises (bd reload-freeze-ROOTCAUSE-addfilecap-cachehit-never-enqueues-2026-07-30):
reloading the SAME map area back-to-back makes `FD4ResCapHolder::AddEntry` hit the surviving
`MsbFileCap` the skipped `_Common_Finalize` left alive. `CS::CSFileRepository::AddFileCap` then takes
its cache-hit branch, which returns early WITHOUT calling `PushFileCap` -- so no load is ever enqueued
and `FUN_1406157f0` (case 2) polls `FD4FileCap::loadState == 4` forever with no timeout.

The candidate fix is the existing opt-in Phase-3 outgoing-world teardown
(`er-quickload-enable-outgoing-teardown.txt`), which routes the outgoing world through
`CS::InGameStep::_Common_Finalize` so the map FD4FileCap is released and the next `AddEntry` MISSES.

Both arms are DETERMINISTIC and fully agent-driven: load 1 is the configured autoload, and load 2 is
triggered by the product's own control file (`er-quickload-switch-slot.txt`, polled every in-world
frame), which is the same code path the user's menu click reaches. No input harness, no menu nav.

  ARM off  -> expect FROZEN  (reproduces the bug)
  ARM on   -> expect LOADED  (oracle_common_finalize_count increments)

Usage:
  python3 scripts/run-reload-freeze-ab.py --teardown off --label control
  python3 scripts/run-reload-freeze-ab.py --teardown on  --label fix

Save safety: the configured source save is opened READ-ONLY by the DLL (staged into a private tree);
this script never writes it. It backs up and restores the game-dir er-quickload.toml and the marker.
