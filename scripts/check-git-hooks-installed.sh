# IS THE PRE-PUSH GATE ACTUALLY INSTALLED -- BY EITHER OF THE TWO ROUTES GIT CAN TAKE?
#
# Measured 2026-08-31, twice, in the same direction both times: the hook layer failing open while
# looking installed.
#
#   * This clone's `core.hooksPath` was the ABSOLUTE path
#     /home/banon/projects/er-effects-rs/.githooks, left behind by commit 39a919e0, which renamed
#     the repository directory to er-mods-rs. Git resolved its hooks directory to somewhere that no
#     longer existed, so NO hook ran at all -- not the main-push guard, not the gate suite
#     -- and nothing said so, because a hook that cannot be found is indistinguishable from a hook
#     that passed.
#
#   * Later the same day `core.hooksPath` was UNSET for about ninety minutes. Git then used its
#     fallback, $GIT_COMMON_DIR/hooks, which is not version-controlled and which held a 537-byte
#     block-main-only pre-push from 2026-07-27 -- no scripts/check-committed-compiles.sh, no
#     the gate suite. A push reached origin through it. It happened to be green.
#
# So this asserts, in the order they fail:
#   1. core.hooksPath is set at all;
#   2. it RESOLVES to a real directory holding an executable pre-push;
#   3. the configured value is RELATIVE. An absolute path is correct until the day the checkout
#      moves or is renamed, and then it is silently wrong;
#   4. THE FALLBACK IS SAFE TOO. $GIT_COMMON_DIR/hooks must hold scripts/hooks-fallback-shim
#      verbatim, under every name scripts/hooks/ carries -- so that whichever way git resolves the
#      hook, the same checks run. Checks 1-3 describe a value that several tools write (beads
#      rewrites core.hooksPath: see the header of scripts/hooks-fallback-shim), so the fallback is
#      not a theoretical path. Byte-identical, not merely present: a stale shim is the 2026-07-27
#      failure with a newer date on it.
#   5. THE HOOK GIT WILL RUN IS *OURS*. Checks 1-4 are all about WHERE the hook is; none of them
#      opens it. See check_hook_identity below for the measured hazard that closes -- in one
#      sentence: `bd hooks install` honours an existing core.hooksPath and writes its own shims
#      INTO IT, which here is the version-controlled scripts/hooks, and every check above stays
#      green afterwards because a hook is still installed and still executable.
#
# Not run in CI: a fresh runner has no local hook configuration and does not push.

# IS THE HOOK GIT WILL RUN *OURS*? The question checks 1-4 cannot ask, because none of them opens
# the file.
#
# MEASURED 2026-08-31, in a throwaway repo: `bd hooks install` HONOURS an existing
# core.hooksPath and writes its five shim files INTO THAT DIRECTORY. Here core.hooksPath is
# `scripts/hooks`, which is VERSION-CONTROLLED, so one `bd hooks install` -- a command every
# agent in this tree is one keystroke from, and which `bd doctor` is a front door to -- replaces
# the tracked pre-commit and pre-push with beads' shims. Checks 1-4 all stay green afterwards: a
# hook is still installed, still executable, at exactly the configured path. The next agent then
# commits the overwrite as an ordinary file change and the gate is gone for everyone.
#
# Three depths, because each sees a state the other two cannot:
#
#   (a) WHAT GIT WILL EXECUTE is either scripts/hooks/<name> itself, a byte-identical copy of it,
#       or one of the two WRAPPERS this repo ships -- scripts/hooks-fallback-shim and
#       .githooks/<name>. Those two are allowed to differ because they exec the tracked file
#       instead of reimplementing it, and clones exist configured for either directory. Content
#       identity is not assertable for a wrapper (its whole job is to have different bytes), so
#       the weaker property asserted there is: it is byte-identical to a wrapper this repo
#       ships, that wrapper still names scripts/hooks/, and it matches its own committed blob.
#       This is the check for core.hooksPath aimed somewhere ELSE entirely (`.beads/hooks` is
#       the literal beads writes when the key is absent; see the header of
#       scripts/hooks-fallback-shim for the binary's own strings).
#
#   (b) scripts/hooks/<name> IS BYTE-IDENTICAL TO THE BLOB COMMITTED AT HEAD. In today's
#       configuration git executes the worktree file directly, so (a) compares that file with
#       itself and proves nothing; the committed blob is the only independent copy in existence.
#       An overwrite shows up here the moment it lands, before anyone commits it. The cost is
#       that an UNCOMMITTED edit to a hook is also a refusal -- which is the intended reading:
#       the thing gating the push should be the thing a reviewer can see.
#
#   (c) scripts/hooks/<name> STILL INVOKES THE GATE IT EXISTS TO RUN. (b) is defeated by a single
#       commit, and "somebody committed the weaker hook" is not hypothetical here -- it is the
#       2026-07-27 fallback's entire life story. hook_required_invocations above is that floor.
