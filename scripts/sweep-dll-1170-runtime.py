"""Launch each cdylib ALONE on ELDEN RING 1.17 and record what it does, one DLL per run.

WHY ONE DLL AT A TIME
---------------------
On 2026-08-29 the whole mod set was failing and it was being discussed as "the mods break 1.17".
It is not one failure. Nine single-DLL launches found THREE different ones, and the crates that
boot cleanly outnumber the ones that do not:

    er_quickload          0xc0000005 EXECUTE at a CS::CSFadeImp object, +1.7s
    er_loading_portrait   vanishes ~4s after its first Present, leaving NO crash record
    er_armament_icons     0xc000001d ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION at game+0x32ee2b5

READ THE SIGNATURE, NOT THE LIVENESS. Scoring rows live/dead would have convicted er-gfx (shared
by two dying shells -- but they die differently) and the Present hook (both Present-hooking shells
died -- until er_loading_bar, which hooks Present and boots, killed that theory). A bisect on
liveness alone gets the wrong crate; the crash-log signature is what discriminates.

WHAT IT RECORDS
    boots        the thread-group leader is still alive at the end of the watch window
    dies:<sig>   the leader went `Z` or the process vanished; `<sig>` is the first
                 access-violation / exception line its own crash log carried, if any
    no-launch    the game never came up at all (a launcher or environment problem, not a DLL one)

Results merge into `docs/recon/dll-1170-runtime-results.json`, which
`scripts/audit-1170-readiness.py` prints as its `runtime` column. That file is the ONLY source of
runtime truth: a DLL with zero ungated addresses is not thereby working, and nothing infers one
from the other.

DO NOT REBUILD WHILE THIS RUNS
------------------------------
Measured 2026-08-29, by doing it: a sweep was started, DLLs were rebuilt 10 minutes into it, and
the run silently became a mix -- the first eight DLLs tested one build and the rest another. A
sweep that cannot say which build it measured is not evidence, and 18 verdicts had to be thrown
away. So the sweep now fingerprints every DLL at the start and ABORTS the moment one changes
underneath it, rather than producing a result that looks fine and is not.

EVERY RUN GETS ITS OWN ARTIFACT DIRECTORY
-----------------------------------------
er-artifact-redirect: this launches the game once per cdylib through `~/Elden/launch.sh`, and the
audit's shell-name detector cannot see that -- the DLL under test is resolved from cargo metadata
at runtime, so no `er_quickload.dll` literal appears anywhere in this file. This marker opts the
sweep in explicitly rather than leaving it invisible, which reads exactly like a clean tree.

It matters more here than anywhere else in the repo: `--all` is twenty-plus launches back to back.
A game-directory artifact is SINGLE-SLOT (`er_game_base::log::begin_fresh_run` keeps one `.prev`),
so an unredirected sweep destroys not only every other session's evidence but its OWN -- by the
time it finishes, the only crash log left describes the last DLL it tested. Each run therefore gets
`target/runtime-probe/sweep-1170/<crate>-<stamp>/`, and `crash_signature` reads THAT rather than
the game directory.

SAFETY / HOUSE RULES
  * launches only the approved `~/Elden/launch.sh` path -- never Steam, never the EAC launcher;
  * one game at a time, torn down between runs via `scripts/er-teardown.py`;
  * profiles are written to `~/Elden/sweep-<dll>.me3` and name only the one DLL under test;
  * nothing in the game directory is ever deleted -- it is somebody else's run.
