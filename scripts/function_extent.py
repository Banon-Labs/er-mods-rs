"""Where a function ENDS, for every offline tool in this repo that decodes forward.

THE ONE RULE THIS MODULE EXISTS TO ENFORCE
------------------------------------------
A linear x86-64 decode starting at an address in the de-Arxan'd images is trustworthy only
INSIDE one function. Past the `ret` the decoder is reading inter-function padding and the
deobfuscator's LEFTOVER BYTES -- not a uniform `cc`/`90` run -- so it RESYNCHRONISES into
plausible-looking instructions that were never assembled, including branches. Anything that
decides a verdict on those bytes is deciding it on noise.

The class has been found FIVE times as of 2026-08-31, each time as a forward decode bounded by
a byte COUNT instead of by a function EXTENT:

  1. `audit-1170-hook-targets.py::patch_safe` read a flat 0x400 from the hook target. On a
     14-byte leaf that is 0x3f2 bytes of the neighbours, and it manufactured a
     `jno 0x14067ac91` -- a branch into the patch operand -- out of one padding byte. The 1.17
     counterpart is the same fourteen bytes and stayed green only because its junk pad byte was
     `28` instead of `83`.
  2. 12 false `DIVERGE` verdicts (2026-08-30), a verifier decoding past a tail call.
  3. 31 false `SHAPE-DIFF`s, same date, same cause.
  4. A trampoline walk that counted bytes past its own `ret`.
  5. `check-singleton-field-offsets.py::_follow` walked five instructions from a
     `mov r64,[rip+SessionManager]` at 1.17 `0x140257d0f`, whose function `.pdata` ends at
     `0x140257d22`, and collected `lea edx,[rax+0x18]` at `0x140257d28` -- SIX BYTES into the
     next function, where `rax` holds something else. That phantom was the sole evidence for the
     gate's headline claim that "SessionManager gains one field in 1.17". The same walk invented
     `CS::PlayerGameData +0xe5` in BOTH images, 0x17 bytes past the declared end each time --
     symmetric, so it never showed up as a LOST field either.

THREE SOURCES, MOST AUTHORITATIVE FIRST
---------------------------------------
  1. `.pdata` declares a function STARTING at the address -- the linker's own answer, with chunk
     runs merged by `function_regions` so a split function's extent is the whole run rather than
     its first couple of dozen bytes.
  2. `.pdata` declares one CONTAINING it. The address is then mid-function, which is a separate
     question, but the enclosing extent is still the right bound for reading its bytes.
  3. Neither: an unwindless leaf. The x64 ABI omits unwind data for a function that allocates no
     stack and calls nothing, so ELDEN RING's small getters have no `.pdata` entry at all --
     `.pdata` is blind across 146,715 holes and a missing entry is NOT a missing function. Its
     end is DECODED by `verify-rva-map-1170.py::leaf_extent`, the watermark rule that refuses to
     stop at a `ret` some earlier branch reaches past.

Measured over the 425 rows both detour ledgers admit, in BOTH images: 359 declared, 0 enclosed,
66 decoded leaves, 0 unknown. `body_end` returning None is a fallback nothing in the current
tables takes, and a caller that gets None must REFUSE rather than substitute a byte count.

WHY IT LIVES HERE AND NOT IN THE TOOL THAT FIRST NEEDED IT
----------------------------------------------------------
It was written inside `scripts/audit-1170-hook-targets.py`. Four more tools then needed the same
answer, and a second implementation of extent resolution is the next divergence bug -- the rule's
own history is two earlier wrong versions (first-`ret` truncation, and a padding-only tail-`jmp`
test that walked straight through the de-Arxan'd images' leftover gap bytes). So the primitive
moved to a module with a plain importable name and no import side effects, and every consumer --
`audit-1170-hook-targets.py` included -- imports it from here.

`scripts/check-decode-extent-bounds.py` is the gate that keeps instance six from being written.
