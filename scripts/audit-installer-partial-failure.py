"""SWEEP 1 detector: which hook/patch installers lose SIBLING hooks to one refusal?

On 1.17 an address with no verified mapping is REFUSED by design. An installer that
turns that refusal into a function-level `return`/`?` kills every OTHER hook it was
going to install -- so one unmapped address silently disables a dozen working ones
(bd `one-refused-hook-must-not-abort-the-installer-2026-08-30`).

This flags a function when BOTH hold:
  * it performs 2+ install/resolve actions (siblings exist to lose), and
  * it has an ABORT construct (`?`, `.unwrap()`, `return`, `let ... else { .. return }`)
    that is not inside a `continue`-shaped or labelled-block-shaped recovery.

It deliberately over-reports: the output is a review list, NOT a verdict, and it is a
MANUAL TOOL -- deliberately not wired into `scripts/check.sh`. What follows is why, and
what became of the nineteen rows it printed on 2026-08-31.

WHY THIS DOES NOT GATE
======================
Its stated subject is now covered precisely by two gates that DO run:

  * `scripts/check-hook-batch-abort.py` -- the batched path. `MhHook::new` + `queue_enable`
    + `MH_ApplyQueued` is the ONLY shape that can leave an already-created detour stranded,
    because the `register_*_hook` registrars call `MH_EnableHook` immediately and never
    touch MinHook's pending set. That gate enumerates the batched universe exactly.
  * `scripts/check-detour-rva-coverage.py` -- the addresses that go missing in the first place.

This one keys on `return`-appears-anywhere with two or more actions, which cannot tell an
abort apart from a re-entry guard, a module-base early-out, or the "nothing queued, so
nothing to apply" check that the CORRECT fix for the P0 introduces. Wiring it would mean
bolting a fifteen-row acknowledgement list onto a matcher whose own rule cannot distinguish
the rows -- a green that means nothing.

THE NINETEEN ROWS OF 2026-08-31, ADJUDICATED
============================================
  4  matcher fault, now FIXED: the INSTALL pattern matched the function's own `fn NAME(`
     declaration, putting all four of er-hook's single-hook dispatch wrappers over the
     `actions >= 2` bar. See `body_of`. The count is 15 after the fix.
  1  REAL DEFECT, now fixed: `er-refill-all/src/runtime.rs::install` registered
     `DepositoryDialog::ctor` before `::dtor` through an IMMEDIATE-ENABLE registrar, so a
     refused dtor address left the ctor detour armed with nothing to clear the latch it
     sets -- and the caller registers the FrameBegin task regardless of the early return,
     so `tick()` read through a freed `DepositoryDialog*` every frame for the rest of the
     session. Fixed by registering the dtor first, which makes both partial states inert.
  3  already remediated, flagged only by the coarse `return` rule: the two 2026-08-30
     per-hook-latch rewrites (`title_resources_stats_text.rs`, `stats_loading_text.rs`) and
     `install_scaleform_handler_lifecycle_guard`, which is DECLARED ATOMIC with a reason.
 11  correct by construction: re-entry guards, `MH_Initialize` early-outs, module-base
     guards, read-only probes that merely call `write_global_u8`, and per-hook recovery
     that the rule cannot see.

ZERO were a live queued-but-never-applied batch failure. Run `--selftest` to see the
positive controls fire.

def body_of(mask):
    """The masked text from the opening brace onwards -- the SIGNATURE removed.

    `mask` begins at the `fn NAME(` declaration, and several of the install primitives this
    scans for ARE themselves functions in `er-hook`, so a declaration scored a hit on itself.
    Counting the signature put all four of er-hook's single-hook dispatch wrappers over the
    `actions >= 2` threshold and onto the review list as batch installers, which they are not:
    `register_union_hook`, `register_union_hook_resolved`, `register_union_hook_runtime_derived`
    and `register_shared_hook_with_budget` each bind exactly ONE target and delegate. Four of
    the nineteen 2026-08-31 findings were this and nothing else.

    Name-comparison does not fix it, because `INSTALL` matches `register_union_hook` as a
    PREFIX of `fn register_union_hook_resolved` -- the matched text and the function name are
    different strings, so the self-hit survives the comparison. Dropping the signature does fix
    it, and it also drops the parameter list, where a `stub: [u8; STUB_LEN]` argument name can
    collide with nothing but noise.
