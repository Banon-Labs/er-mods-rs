"""Reject a test scratch path under a SHARED temp root that carries no per-process component.

WHAT WENT WRONG, THREE TIMES IN ONE DAY, IN SIX CRATES
------------------------------------------------------
A test builds its scratch directory from a FIXED name under `std::env::temp_dir()` and wipes it
on entry. Under this repo's wine runner `%TEMP%` IS the host `/tmp` -- one directory shared by
every process on the machine -- so a second copy of the same test binary (two agents running
`scripts/check.sh` at once, the host `cargo test` racing the wine `cargo xwin test`, or a second
checkout) deletes the files between one process's `fs::write` and its own probe.

The failure then ACCUSES CORRECT PRODUCT CODE, which is what makes it expensive. Measured
before/after at 8-way concurrency on 2026-08-31:

    er-quit-menu-core     5 of 8 red (one run red on BOTH tests)   ->  8/8, then 16/16
    er-save-redirect      7 of 8 red                               ->  0/80
    er-save-picker-core  10 of 80 red                              ->  0/80
    er-soulsformats       2 of 8 red                               ->  0/80
    er-invasion-warp      1 of 80 red                              ->  0/80

Every single before-failure blamed working code: `WrongSize { len: 0 }` for a container a
sibling had truncated, `MissingOrNotFile` for one it had deleted, `BridgeWriteFailed` for a
directory it had removed, and an identity probe answering `Unknown` because BOTH of its inputs
were `Absent`. An agent spent an hour deciding whether the save-destination logic was broken.
It was not.

WHY A GATE AND NOT A SHARED HELPER CRATE
----------------------------------------
The fix already existed in this repo and was invisible: `save_dest_test_dir` in
`save_dest_commit_runtime.rs`'s test module was pid-keyed and carried a comment describing this
exact failure -- but it was PRIVATE TO THAT MODULE, which is how the tests one file over came to
be written without it. Two of the six fixes hoisted their helper to crate scope for exactly that
reason.

A workspace-wide test-support crate was considered and rejected. It would reach the nine crates
that need it only through nine `[dev-dependencies]` edges plus a new workspace member, and the
crates involved (`soulsformats`, `er-save-picker-core`, `er-hotkey-config`, `er-objectkit`) share
no existing dependency that could host it -- `er-game-base` covers five of nine. The helper's
whole body is one expression. Six copies of one expression was never the problem; nothing
TELLING you about it was. A gate tells you, in the crate you are editing, with the fix in the
message -- which is reachable from every crate in the workspace without a dependency edge at all.

WHAT IT DECIDES ON
------------------
The EXPRESSION, not the name. A constant string joined onto a shared temp root is the defect;
any of these is the fix, and all four forms occur in this tree:

    std::env::temp_dir().join(format!("er-foo-{}", std::process::id()))
    std::env::temp_dir().join(format!("er-foo-{name}-p{pid}", pid = std::process::id()))
    let unique = format!("er-foo-{}-{}", std::process::id(), nanos);  // one let away
    std::env::temp_dir().join(unique)
    tempfile::TempDir::new()                                          // accepted, unused today

A site is SKIPPED without needing an exemption when the path provably cannot reach a filesystem
call: its enclosing test function mentions no filesystem or subprocess token AND its signature
mentions no `Path` type, so the value is inert and local. That is what keeps the four pure
expected-value paths in this tree (`temp_dir().join("run-42")` compared against a function's
return, `Path::new("/tmp/staged/ER0000.sl2")` fed to a pure normalizer) out of the exemption
list, where they would have been noise.

BOTH DIRECTIONS
---------------
`EXEMPT_SITES` and the detector each fail if the other is wrong: an exemption that no longer
matches a would-be finding is reported as STALE and fails the gate, so a site that gets fixed or
deleted cannot leave a dead licence behind. `FROZEN_PROCESS_SCOPED` is the frozen negative -- real,
legitimate, pid-keyed sites that must keep classifying clean, with per-file floors -- so a
detector that stops matching (a lobotomised regex, an empty read, a renamed root) goes red
instead of reporting a confident zero.

WIRING (for whoever lands the current `scripts/check.sh` -- this file must not touch it):

    python3 "$repo_root/scripts/check-test-temp-isolation.py" --selftest
    python3 "$repo_root/scripts/check-test-temp-isolation.py"

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check-test-temp-isolation.py             # scan the tree
    python3 scripts/check-test-temp-isolation.py --selftest  # prove the detector, both ways
    python3 scripts/check-test-temp-isolation.py --list      # every classified site
