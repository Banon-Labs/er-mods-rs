"""Fail the build when one refused hook can abort a whole MinHook batch.

WHAT THE BUG WAS
================
On 2026-08-30 a user played for seven minutes with the mod's loading cover pasted over live
gameplay, and the loading bar froze at `LOADING SAVE 7/11`. Both symptoms had one cause, and it
was not the address that went missing -- it was the shape of the installer around it.

`install_now_loading_helper_observer_hooks` created FIVE observer detours, queue-enabled each into
MinHook's pending set, and applied them all with a single `MH_ApplyQueued()`. Between the queueing
and the apply sat this:

    let mut ok = true;
    ...
    Err(status) => { ...; ok = false; }     # x5, one per hook
    ...
    if !ok { return; }                      # <-- HERE
    match unsafe { MH_ApplyQueued() } { ... }

`LOADING_SCREEN_GFX_FADEOUT_RVA` (1.16.2 `0x90a0a0`) had no detour-safe 1.17 mapping, so
`MhHook::new` refused it, `ok` went false, and the `return` fired. The other FOUR detours were
already created and queued -- correctly, on good addresses -- and were never applied. Among them
was `CS::LoadingScreen::Update`, the sole writer of `LOADING_SCREEN_UPDATE_HITS`, which is:

  * the promoting condition for `LoadPhase::BuildingWorld` (boot phase index 8), so the visible
    ladder stopped at index 7, `LOADING SAVE 7/11`; and
  * upstream of `BOOT_VIEW_RELEASE_NATIVE_DONE_SEEN`, the cover's release predicate, so the cover
    had no reachable exit at all.

One unmapped address, four healthy detours dead, two user-visible failures. The address is fixed
and `check-detour-rva-coverage.py` now gates that class. THIS gate covers the other half: the
batch shape that turned one refusal into five.

THE RULE
========
A function that queue-enables MORE THAN ONE hook must reach its `MH_ApplyQueued()`. It may not
return early on an AGGREGATE flag -- a single local boolean that more than one hook's outcome
writes -- because such a flag cannot say WHICH hook failed and the early return punishes all of
them. Per-hook state is the fix: a hook that cannot install costs one feature, never the batch.

Note what this deliberately does NOT forbid. A `return` on a SINGLE hook's outcome is fine (there
is no batch to damage). A `return` before anything is queued is fine. A flag read AFTER the apply
is fine -- the batch already landed.

THE ONE EXEMPTION, AND WHY IT IS NOT AN EXCUSE LIST
===================================================
Some hook sets are genuinely ATOMIC: installing part of the set is worse than installing none.
`install_scaleform_handler_lifecycle_guard` is the measured case in this tree. Its dtor detour
SKIPS the game's real destructor for any object absent from a live-set that only its ctor detour
fills, so a dtor installed without its ctor classifies EVERY teardown as a double-free and skips
it. For such a set the all-or-nothing abort is the correct behaviour.

To declare one, put a line

    // HOOK-BATCH-ATOMIC: <why partial installation is unsafe>

inside the function. A bare marker with no reason does NOT exempt. Every exemption is PRINTED on
every run, pass or fail, so the set of them stays visible instead of accumulating in silence --
the same rule `1170-translation-collisions.baseline.tsv` is kept under.

WHAT COUNTS
===========
offender = a function body where all of the following hold:

  1. it calls `MH_ApplyQueued(`;
  2. it creates TWO OR MORE hooks (`MhHook::new(` / `register_union_hook` / `register_shared_hook`)
     -- with one hook there is no batch to damage and the early return costs nothing;
  3. it declares a local `let mut F = true;` / `= false;` (optionally `: bool`);
  4. `F` is written from TWO OR MORE distinct sites in the body (`F = false`, `F &= ..`,
     `F = F && ..`) -- one write is one hook's outcome and cannot be an aggregate;
  5. a `return` guarded by `F` (`if !F { .. return .. }`) sits BEFORE the first
     `MH_ApplyQueued(` in the body.

Condition 2 is load-bearing and was learned the hard way: without it the gate flagged
`install_menu_window_job_dtor_guard` and `install_quit_to_desktop_clean_kill_hook`, which install
exactly ONE hook each and write `ok` twice only because a create failure and a `queue_enable`
failure are two different ways for THAT hook to fail. Both are now GREEN selftest fixtures.

Comments and string literals are masked out before any of this is measured, because the sources
this scans carry multi-page doc comments and format strings full of braces, and brace-matching
through them finds the wrong function body -- a failure mode that reports a confident zero.
