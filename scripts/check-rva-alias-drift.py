"""Guard against re-introducing duplicate literal declarations of one game address.

An RVA *is* a game function's identity. When the same address is written out under several
names -- or the same name is written out independently in several crates -- a 1.16.x address
correction has to be found in every one of them, and CLAUDE.md records that missing one
crash-hooks (`armament-icons-cachemiss-hooks-crash-1162-address-drift`).

Worse than the maintenance cost: divergent names are divergent CLAIMS about what the address
is, and at least one of them is then a wrong reverse-engineering fact shipping in the DLL.
Three were found this way on 2026-08-01 (bd
`rva-67b750-is-save-write-not-continue-load-2026-08-01`,
`rva-4852f88-is-saveload2-slsystemimpl-not-fd4-io-worker-2026-08-01`).

The fix for a real duplicate is to declare the value ONCE -- in `er-game-base/src/rva.rs` for
cross-cutting singletons -- and derive every other name from it, so the aliases stay but the
value does not.

This follows the `check-oracle-writers.py` shape: an allowlist pins the CURRENT known
duplicates so the cleanup can proceed incrementally, and the gate fails only on NEW ones.

Two traps this encodes, both of which produced wrong answers when the audit was done by hand:

1. Scanning only `const NAME: usize = 0x...` misses `u32`-typed address constants. That
   undercounted the real duplicate set by ~35% and hid `MOUNT_GUARD_STATE_ROOT_RVA`, which
   turned out to be GameDataMan. All integer widths are scanned here.
2. Grouping by NAME finds nothing. The duplication has two shapes -- different names for one
   address, and one name re-declared independently in several crates. Grouping by VALUE is
   the only thing that catches both.

...AND A THIRD, WHICH IS TRAP 1 AGAIN ONE LEVEL UP (fixed 2026-08-30)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Widening the TYPE was not enough, because the type was never the only thing the single `DECL`
regex demanded. It also demanded a SCREAMING_SNAKE name, a hex literal on the same LINE as the
`const`, and that the declaration be a `const` at all. This tree writes the same fact four other
ways, and every one of them was invisible:

    MenuJobWait = 0x00b0d400,          inside `#[repr(u32)] pub enum MenuTraceRva`
    const FOO_VA: usize = 0x140b0d400; the VA spelling of an address written elsewhere as an RVA
    const LONG_RVA: usize =            the literal on the next line, which rustfmt does routinely
        0x9af3a0;
    const TABLE: [usize; 2] = [..];    a table of addresses with no name per element

Values now come from `scripts/rva_symbols.py`, which resolves all of those, so the grouping key is
the ADDRESS however it is spelled -- and a VA is folded onto its RVA, because 0x141eb9ed0 and
0x1eb9ed0 are one function and a 1.17 correction has to reach both.

MEASURED on this tree: 33 -> 81 duplicate address groups, none lost. 30 of the 48 new ones are a
`*_VA` in a crate's `build.rs` beside the `*_RVA` in its `src/` (`GAME_HEAP_ALLOC_VA` /
`GAME_HEAP_ALLOC_RVA`), and 15 are an enum discriminant beside a const -- including 0x262250,
declared as both `PROFILE_MARK_SLOT_USED_RVA` and `ProfileLoadMenuRva::ProfileSlotActivate`, which
is this tool's real subject: two names are two CLAIMS about what the address is, and at least one
of them is a wrong reverse-engineering fact shipping in the DLL.

WHAT IS STILL NOT A DUPLICATE, and must not become one: a DERIVED declaration. `const BAR_RVA:
usize = er_game_base::rva::FOO_RVA;` is the FIX for a duplicate -- it leaves exactly one literal --
so a declaration counts here only when the address is written out IN ITS OWN initialiser. Counting
resolved values alone would report every correctly-centralised alias as drift and invert the tool.

AN INTEGER THAT MERELY LOOKS LIKE ONE (fixed 2026-08-30)
--------------------------------------------------------
Grouping by VALUE is the only thing that catches both duplication shapes -- and it is also why a
number that is not an address at all can collide with one. `0x989680` blocked the WHOLE of
`scripts/check.sh` for hours as a "duplicate": one site is an element of a powers-of-ten log ladder
in `er-game-base/src/game_build.rs`, the other is the FILETIME tick rate (10_000_000 100ns ticks per
second) in the save picker. Neither is an address. They collide because 10,000,000 happens to land
inside the RVA window -- and because this gate runs BEFORE `cargo fmt` under `set -euo pipefail`,
that one false positive hid every check after it from every agent and from the user.

Pinning that one value in the allowlist would have been a per-incident patch. 1e7 is not exotic:
timer scales, byte budgets and log ladders all produce round decimal numbers in this range, so the
next collision is a matter of time, and it would block the same 265 lines of `check.sh` again.

So a declaration now claims an address only when the address is written in HEXADECIMAL. That is not
a style preference dressed up as a rule; it was MEASURED on this tree before it was adopted:

  * of the 647 in-window literal declaration sites, 9 write the value in decimal, and NOT ONE of
    them is a game address -- `HASH_MULTIPLIERS`, `TICKS_PER_SECOND`, `MAX_PLAUSIBLE_FUNCTIONS`,
    `PORTRAIT_IDLE_ANIM_IDS`, `DEFAULT_EFFECT_ID`, `EXPECTED_CANDIDATE_ID`, a test `BASE`, and the
    two halves of the 0x989680 collision;
  * dropping them removes exactly ONE duplicate group -- 0x989680 -- and leaves the other 81
    unchanged, with not one group even losing a site.

The three alternatives were rejected on evidence rather than taste:

  * TYPE does not separate this case at all. `u64` IS an address type here (44 hex sites: every
    `*_VA` in every `build.rs`), and the log ladder is a `[u64; 8]`. `[usize; 2]`, `&[usize]` and
    even an `i32` carry real addresses in this tree too.
  * NAME is the discriminator this repo has already been burned by: 27 addresses were invisible to
    `select-needed-1170-rows.py` earlier the same day precisely because they are not spelled
    `*RVA*`. An inclusion filter keyed on the name would rebuild that blindness inside this gate.
  * CONTAINER ("an element of an ascending powers-of-ten array is not an address") is true of one
    of the two colliding sites and useless for the other.

NAME IS STILL USED -- AS THE ALARM ON THE BLIND SPOT THIS CREATES, NEVER AS THE FILTER. A hex-only
rule goes silently blind the day somebody writes a real address in decimal, and a gate that passes
because it stopped looking is the failure mode this migration has hit repeatedly. So every DECIMAL
in-window literal whose symbol carries the repo's address convention (`*_RVA`, `*_VA`,
`SomethingRva::Variant`) is a hard failure with its own message. Name is unreliable for deciding
what IS an address; it is entirely sound for catching a constant that CLAIMS to be one. Zero
declarations trip it today, so it needs no baseline.

    python3 scripts/check-rva-alias-drift.py --selftest # prove the gate detects what it claims
