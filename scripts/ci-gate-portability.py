"""Which scripts/check.sh gates can run on a machine that holds no game-derived input.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `.github/workflows/check.yml` ran nine gates while `scripts/check.sh` ran 224, and
the gap was invisible because the workflow's step list is written BY HAND. A hand-written list of
gate names drifts the moment somebody adds a gate, and nothing says it drifted -- the same disease
that left `scripts/opa-query.sh` silently unlinted by check.sh's hand-written shellcheck list. So
the CI set is DERIVED: this module reads the step list back out of check.sh -- using check.sh's OWN
`_check_step_pattern`, never a second copy of it -- and joins it against a ledger that says, for
each gate, what external input it needs.

THE LEDGER IS MEASURED, NOT GUESSED. `docs/ci-gate-portability.tsv` was produced by running every
step twice: once in the developer tree, once in a `git worktree` of the same commit, which holds
tracked files only and is therefore exactly what `actions/checkout` puts on a runner. A static scan
for `eldenring-deobf` was tried first and was wrong in both directions -- 18 gates that name the
image ran fine without it, and gates that never name it failed -- so the scan was thrown away.

  portable  ran and passed with no game-derived input present
  partial   ran and passed, but its own output says it skipped a half it could not do
  blocked   could not run at all; the input it needs cannot exist on a runner

`--check` is the anti-drift gate, and it is the whole point: a step added to check.sh with no
ledger row is RED, so the classification cannot silently fall behind the suite the way check.yml's
step list did. Rows are keyed by script name plus flags, never by line number, so the ledger
survives ordinary edits to check.sh.

WHAT IS NOT LEDGERED, ON PURPOSE. Steps that invoke a TOOL rather than a repo script -- `cargo`,
`shellcheck`, `rustfmt`, `opa`, `cupcake` -- have a uniform answer ("is the tool installed") that
check.sh answers at run time in `_check_tool_skip`, with no list to maintain. Giving them ledger
rows would add ~60 rows that all say the same thing and could go stale.

  python3 scripts/ci-gate-portability.py --check        # ledger covers every step (the gate)
  python3 scripts/ci-gate-portability.py --list         # every step with its bucket
  python3 scripts/ci-gate-portability.py --probe        # what is available HERE, and what that costs
  python3 scripts/ci-gate-portability.py --skip-lines   # what check.sh must skip HERE
  python3 scripts/ci-gate-portability.py --selftest     # positive controls for --check
  python3 scripts/ci-gate-portability.py --run --root D # re-measure: run every step under root D
