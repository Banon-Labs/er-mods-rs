"""Where caller voting and `rva-map-1162-to-1170.functions.tsv` disagree, say which is right.

Two independent methods pair the same 1.16.2 function with a 1.17 one:

* `functions.tsv` matches a RUNTIME_FUNCTION's opening 64 bytes, masked, and requires the
  signature to be unique on both sides.  It never looks at who calls the function.
* Caller voting (`scripts/pair-leaf-functions-1162-1170.py`) takes an already-paired caller
  whose two bodies have identical extent length and identical direct-branch offsets, and
  reads the i-th call target off each side.  It never looks at the callee's bytes.

Agreement between them is the positive control for voting.  DISAGREEMENT is a bug in one of
them, and it matters which: a wrong `functions.tsv` row is a 1.17 address that reads as live.

The adjudicator is byte evidence, not a vote count: take the 1.16.2 function's whole declared
extent, mask it with the repo's own rule, and require the candidate to have the SAME extent
length and the SAME masked body.  Only if neither or both match does it fall back to which
candidate's delta agrees with the surrounding region -- and it says so.
