"""Score one `er_effects_rs.dll` by launching it ALONE and asking whether the game really lived.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`scripts/er-run-branch.py` verifies a DLL's provenance against the CURRENT working tree and
refuses anything that does not match. That is right for testing your own branch and useless for
testing a DLL GitHub built from a commit you are not standing on. This tool takes the opposite
contract: the artifact is authoritative, the tree is irrelevant, and the only question asked is
whether that build survives its boot window. Walk `main-*` pre-releases newest-first and the
answer bisects "which build started dying".

Each candidate runs ALONE -- a profile with exactly one `[[natives]]` entry, no Seamless, no
co-loaded shells -- so a death cannot be blamed on a neighbour. That is also why this does not go
through `er-dll-closure.py`/`er-gen-me3-profile.py`: their job is to assemble a compatible SET
from a source tree, and here there is neither a set nor a tree.

WHAT "SURVIVED" MEANS, AND WHY IT IS NOT "THE PROCESS EXISTS"
------------------------------------------------------------
bd `er-liveness-oracle-is-thread-count-not-process-existence-2026-08-25`: after a wedged launch
`eldenring.exe` stays in /proc for MINUTES as a two-thread husk at 0% CPU. Every scan of
`/proc/*/comm` calls that alive, so an A/B built on process existence measures nothing -- both
arms are husks. The verdict here therefore comes from `er-teardown.game_status()`: thread count
AND CPU burn, with the husk rule owned by that module and not restated here.

The DLL's own log is read only as corroboration, never as the verdict. Same memory: a log that
was not rotated is the PREVIOUS run's log, and the me3 line count of a healthy run and a wedged
one were both 32. This deletes the log before launching, so "no log" means "never reached the
DLL's install()", and it checks the mtime against the launch instant before believing a word of
it.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/er-release-bisect.py                       # newest main-* releases, in order
    python3 scripts/er-release-bisect.py --tag main-abc1234
    python3 scripts/er-release-bisect.py --dll path/to/er_effects_rs.dll --label tree
