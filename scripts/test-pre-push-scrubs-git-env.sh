# Prove scripts/hooks/pre-push cannot let a gate edit the live repository.
#
# The defect this pins, measured 2026-09-06. `git` exports GIT_DIR to hooks run from a linked
# WORKTREE but not from the main checkout (scripts/measure-git-hook-env.sh, git 2.55.0). GIT_DIR
# wins over cwd, so a gate that builds a throwaway repository and configures it with
# `git -C <fixture> config ...` writes to this repository instead of the fixture. A push from
# .worktrees/teardown-outcome came back with the config guard reporting
#     core.hooksPath  scripts/hooks -> /home/banon/projects/er-mods-rs/scripts/hooks
# -- an absolute path computed for a fixture, landing on the checkout every other worktree and
# every other agent reads.
#
# Why a behavioural test and not a GREP. `unset $(git rev-parse --local-env-vars)` is one line and
# easy to keep; what is easy to lose is its position. Moved above the `cd`, or below the first
# gate, it still greps fine and stops working. So this builds a real main-repo-plus-linked-worktree
# pair in a temp directory, exports GIT_DIR exactly as git does, and measures where a fixture write
# actually lands -- with and without the scrub. Nothing here touches the repository it lives in.
