"""Keep the field offsets NOBODY CAN ATTRIBUTE visible, and shrink that set on purpose.

THE PROBLEM THIS IS THE RESIDUAL OF
-----------------------------------
A struct field offset is the only completely silent failure class in the 1.16.2 -> 1.17
migration. A stale detour target is REFUSED by `er-hook` and logged. An unmapped data RVA
resolves to 0 and the caller says so. A moved field returns a plausible number of the right width,
forever, with no fault and no log line.

Two gates already measure that class, and both bottom out in the same place:

  * `scripts/check-object-field-offsets-1170.py` re-measures 21 frozen witness rows for
    `CS::PlayerGameData` and `CS::PlayerIns` -- the two objects the migration actually took apart.
  * `scripts/check-singleton-field-offsets.py` clears any offset whose owner is one of the seven
    singleton-rooted classes it can reach through a global.

Everything else is UNATTRIBUTED, and an offset whose owning object cannot be named cannot be
measured at all: joining a repo constant to a drift row on the NUMBER is worthless in both
directions, because `0x50`, `0x88`, `0x90` and `0xb0c` are field offsets in dozens of unrelated
structures. `0xb0c` moved in 1.17 -- in `MoWwiseManImp`, the Wwise audio manager -- while
`DIALOG_SLOT_CURSOR_B0C_OFFSET` is a title dialog at the same number and is unaffected.

So the unattributed set is not a to-do list that can be closed by measuring harder. It is closed
one constant at a time, by reading the reverse engineering recorded beside each one and putting
its owner in the shared table. This file's job is to make sure that set is KNOWN, that it can
only shrink, and that a new unattributed constant has to be justified rather than merely added.

WHAT COUNTS AS ATTRIBUTED
-------------------------
Exactly what the two existing gates already consult, imported rather than copied:

  1. an `offset_of!(T, field)` whose `T` this workspace declares, or one of the unambiguous name
     prefixes -- both from `scripts/detect-struct-field-drift.py` (`inventory()` / `struct_for`);
  2. an entry in `scripts/adjudicate-autoload-offsets.py::OWNERS`, the repo's one hand-read
     constant -> class table. A `None` there is an attribution too: it records "this is a Windows
     / MSVC / PE ABI structure a FromSoftware patch cannot move", with the reason beside it;
  3. an entry in that same file's `NAMED_WITNESS`, for an object with no vtable of its own --
     a stack buffer, a leaf, a singleton reached through a global. The owner there is a named
     consumer function plus the register that provably holds the object inside it, which is
     weaker than RTTI and is reported as CLEARED-BY-NAMED-WITNESS rather than CLEARED, but it is
     still an owner and the offset is still measurable.

Naming an owner is NOT a clearance. `CS::CSMenuProfModelRend + 0x756` is attributed and still
returns STILL-UNKNOWN from `scripts/clear-fields-by-object.py`. Attribution is what makes the
offset measurable; the measurement is a separate step and is reported separately.

WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS
----------------------
  RATCHET (always runs, reads only repo source).  Every unattributed constant is listed in
      `docs/recon/unattributed-field-offsets.txt`. A constant that is unattributed today and is
      NOT in that file fails the gate. Rows may disappear; they may not appear.

  BLINDNESS FLOORS.  Nine "audits" in this repo have reported zero findings from a matcher that
      had gone blind, because `assert bad == 0` passes over an empty set. A shrinking unattributed
      list is exactly what a blinded inventory or a lost OWNERS import produces, and it would read
      as progress. So the population size and the attributed count carry floors: if either falls
      through the floor the gate goes red and says the matcher went blind, not that the set got
      smaller.

  WITNESSES (runs when the two de-Arxan'd images are present, SKIPs loudly when they are not).
      Frozen function-pair alignments re-measured from the images on every run, in the shape
      `scripts/check-object-field-offsets-1170.py` established: a row that cannot be measured is a
      FAILURE, not a pass.

#
# THE TOP OF THAT RANKING WAS SETTLED ON 2026-08-31, AND THE OWNER WAS THE WRONG CLASS.
# The only row that was BOTH written through AND MOVED-SOMEWHERE was `VK_ARRAY_88_OFFSET` = 0x88
# (er-input-harness/src/pad_inject.rs). It was attributed to `CS::CSInGamePad`, which yields 2
# usable paired method bodies out of 40 -- and that starvation is why it would not settle. It is
# not that class. Its writer, 1.16.2 0x1426634a0 (`mov byte [rcx+rdx*2+0x88],1`, bound
# `cmp eax,0x50` on id-1000), has exactly four call sites (0x140240e70, 0x140241130, 0x140e321b0,
# 0x140e32470) and EVERY one loads `rcx` from `*(manager + 0x18 + dev*8)` =
# `FD4PadManager::padDevices[dev]`; `FD4PadManager::Init` fills that array with `HeapAlloc(0x3c0)`
# + `FD4PadDevice::FD4PadDevice` + `FD4PadDevice::vftable`. So the owner is `FD4::FD4PadDevice`,
# and the CSInGamePad merely HOLDS the device at its own +0x10.
#
# 0x88 HELD on 1.17. The writer pairs to 0x142665cb0 -- a masked signature that wildcards BOTH the
# displacement and the bound is unique in each image, and the call graph agrees independently (0
# callees, the same four callers, two of them at identical addresses) -- and the two bodies are
# byte-identical, so 0x88 is MEASURED on 1.17 rather than carried. Second witness: the
# `FD4PadDevice` constructor 0x142663880 -> 0x142666090 aligns 168/168 with zero moved offsets,
# holding 0x80 immediately below the array, and the allocation size is still 0x3c0.
#
# The prose that stood here before said WRITER_RVA "lands MID-FUNCTION inside a different 1.17
# function, so that region genuinely changed". The region did move -- uniformly, by +0x2810, which
# is why the naive same-address carry lands mid-function -- but nothing in it changed: all ten
# `disp == 0x88` sites in 0x142660000..0x14266a000 reappear at exactly +0x2810 with identical
# operands, and the class vtable pairs slot for slot (0x143295998 -> 0x143298c58).
#
# `.pdata` blindness was the real obstacle and call-graph topology is what got past it. The two
# padMaps offsets beside it were already settled: builder 0x140240e70 is byte-identical between
# the builds (195/195 aligned at the same address) and holds 0x18, 0x40 and 0x48 on the manager.
#
# NOT WIRED INTO scripts/check.sh. Two other agents held that file when this landed, so the gate
# runs only when invoked. Adding it is one line there, in column 1, like every other step:
