"""Refuse a 1.16.2 -> 1.17 ledger that names the wrong KIND of memory.

WHAT THIS CATCHES, AND WHAT IT ALREADY CAUGHT
---------------------------------------------
Every address ledger `er-game-base/build.rs` reads licenses one of two operations, and the two
need opposite kinds of address. The function ledgers say "this FUNCTION moved here" -- callable,
and for the two that reach `detourable_pairs`, a place MinHook may write five bytes -- which is
only meaningful in EXECUTABLE memory. `rva-map-1162-to-1170.data.tsv` says "this GLOBAL moved
here", which is only meaningful OUTSIDE it. Nothing in the tree checked either claim against the
image's own section table until 2026-08-31.

Measured that day on `docs/recon/rva-1170-detour-audited.tsv`, since deleted. As it stood in HEAD:
444 promoted rows, of which 87 named NON-EXECUTABLE destinations -- 61 in `.data`, 26 in `.rdata`
-- each carrying a prologue verdict like `6B relocatable`. Of the 85 promoted on its "unwindless
leaf" clause, ALL 85 were non-executable, so that clause never once fired on a real leaf.
Regenerating the file from its own current inputs added four more rows of exactly that shape,
taking it to 448 / 91 / 89.

The cause is structural and not a bug in its decoder: `.pdata` declares no function containing a
`.data` global for exactly the same reason it declares none containing an unwindless leaf, so "no
enclosing function" cannot separate the two. Those four added rows are 24 bytes of ZEROS in BOTH
images, decoded as `add [rax], al` three times and reported `6B relocatable`.

The live ledgers were clean when this gate was written, and that is the point of writing it: 103
`verified.tsv` rows, 414 `needed-verified.tsv` rows and 414 `needed.tsv` rows are 100% `.text`,
and 116 `data.tsv` rows are 100% `.data`/`.rdata`. A gate that arrives green on 1047 rows and
would have been red on 87 is a gate that separates, not one that fires on everything.

THREE RULES
-----------
  R1  CODE LEDGER    a row naming a FUNCTION -- callable, and for two of the three ledgers
                     hookable -- must name a destination in an EXECUTABLE section. Applied to
                     EVERY pair row, not only the rows `build.rs` currently admits as detourable:
                     a superset, so no admission logic is transcribed here and none can drift out
                     of sync with build.rs.
  R2  DATA LEDGER    a row in the globals ledger must name a NON-EXECUTABLE destination. A code
                     address filed as a global is how a `read` becomes a call to the wrong thing.
  R3  RETIRED        `docs/recon/rva-1170-detour-audited.tsv` must not exist. This is a TOMBSTONE
                     and it is deliberately narrow: `scripts/audit-1170-hook-targets.py --promote`
                     still writes that path, so one command resurrects the file, and R1 cannot see
                     it because a file `build.rs` does not declare is not a ledger this gate
                     enumerates. DELETE R3 WHEN `--promote` GOES; it is enforcement standing in
                     for a removal that has to land in a file this change did not own.

HOW THE LEDGERS ARE FOUND
-------------------------
Parsed out of `crates/er-game-base/build.rs`, never transcribed, exactly as
`check-no-duplicate-ledger-rows.py` does it and for the same reason: a copied literal is how nine
audits in this repo printed a confident zero. A ledger constant found there that the table below
does not classify STOPS THE RUN (exit 2). A partial view reporting zero violations is this defect
class wearing a green tick.

THE IMAGE IS GITIGNORED
-----------------------
`eldenring-deobf-1.17.bin` is game-derived and not committed, so R1/R2 can only run where it
exists. When it does not, they are SKIPPED OUT LOUD and the exit code says so is not a pass: R3
still runs (it needs no image), and the summary names what was not checked. `--selftest` builds
its own synthetic image and therefore runs everywhere, which is what `check.sh` wires.

USAGE
    python3 scripts/check-ledger-section-kind.py             # the gate
    python3 scripts/check-ledger-section-kind.py --rows      # also print the per-ledger tally
