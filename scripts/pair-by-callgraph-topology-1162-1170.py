"""Pair 1.16.2 -> 1.17 ELDEN RING functions by CALL-GRAPH TOPOLOGY, to a fixpoint.

Every prior 1.16.2 -> 1.17 map in this repo pairs a function by what its BYTES look like:
masked signatures, `.pdata` extents, prologue shapes. That has a structural ceiling -- `.pdata`
declares nothing for 5.55 MB of `.text`, and thousands of ELDEN RING getters are byte-identical
to each other, so the evidence that would separate them is exactly the evidence a byte method
does not have. The leaf pass measured the ceiling: 27,160 of 96,218 leaves paired, 28.2%.

This pairs on POSITION IN THE CALL GRAPH instead. Two Ghidra function lists (366k nodes each,
from the 1.16.2 and 1.17 runtime dumps served on :8765 and :8767) supply the node sets that
`.pdata` could not; `build-callgraph-from-ghidra-funcs.py` supplies the edges. A confident pair
then constrains its neighbours, and the constraint propagates.

THREE RULES, all of which refuse rather than guess:

  DOWN   the i-th direct branch of `a` pairs with the i-th of `b`, once the already-paired
         callees of both have been aligned as a monotone anchor sequence. A caller whose paired
         callees do NOT align is discarded whole -- it is describing a different function.
  UP     `a` and `b` are called by the same (already-paired) set of callers, that set has at
         least MIN_KEY members, and no other node on either side has that caller set.
  DSET   `a` and `b` call the same (already-paired) set of callees, same two conditions.
  ORDER  both images emit functions in the same order, so a run of unpaired nodes bracketed by
         two consecutive pairs has a counterpart run bracketed by their images. When the two runs
         are the same length AND each candidate agrees on body shape, the run is paired
         positionally. Position alone is NOT enough -- ELDEN RING has thousands of interchangeable
         3-instruction getters, and the shape gate is what stops the bracket pairing all of them.
  BRKT   inside the same bracket, a node whose numeric-blanked BODY HASH occurs exactly once on
         each side. Run before ORDER, because it is what catches the two ways position lies: a
         run of near-identical functions where the whole bracket slid by one, and two adjacent
         functions the two builds emitted in opposite order. Both were observed and both were
         decided against ORDER by the bytes.

A proposal becomes a pair only when it is UNANIMOUS (no caller proposes a different target) and
INJECTIVE (no other source claims the same target). Two sources claiming one target both lose;
the more-voted one does not win. Iterating those three to a fixpoint is the whole method.

WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE KNOWN HAZARDS
  * `GAME_HEAP_ALLOC` is one of two BYTE-IDENTICAL 19-byte functions 0xe0 apart. No byte method
    can separate them; a caller vote separated them 3766 to 0.
  * An impostor at 0xaec480 verified IDENTICAL over 56 instructions while the correct pair
    verified over 9. Instruction count is not confidence. Graph position is not fooled by a
    longer look-alike.

MEASURED, NOT ASSERTED
  --holdout F withholds a random fraction of the seed ledger, runs to fixpoint without it, and
  reports how often the topology re-derived the withheld answer. That number, per rule and per
  shape tier, is the only reason to believe any row below.
