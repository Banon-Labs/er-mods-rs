"""Forbid comparing a LIVE stack address against a raw 1.16.2 RVA.

WHY
===
Every other stale-address class in this workspace announces itself. A detour goes through
`er-hook`, which logs `HOOK REFUSED`. A call goes through `er_game_base::mem::game_rva`, which
logs `ADDRESS REFUSED`. `scripts/check-stale-rva-calls.py` ratchets the ones that do not.

CALL SITES have no such moment. `trace_first_game_caller_rva()` and
`callstack_contains_game_rva(start, end)` take a return address off the live stack with
`RtlCaptureStackBackTrace`, subtract the module base, and compare the result against a 1.16.2
constant. Nothing is resolved, so nothing can be refused: on a build that moved the code the
comparison simply never matches. No log line of any kind is produced, and the feature behind it
is silently dead.

MEASURED, 2026-08-30. Nine such comparisons existed. Two shipped user-visible features:

  * the Load Character / Load Character from File / Load Build from URL rows were never cloned
    onto the System>Quit tab, because `SYSTEM_QUIT_DUPLICATE_TARGET_RETURN_RVA` (0x958a20) never
    matched a 1.17 frame;
  * the title FadeIn suppression never fired, because
    `TITLE_GFX_VISIBLE_TITLE_FADEIN_CALLER_RVA` (0x744e02) never matched either.

Both addresses are MID-FUNCTION, so neither could ever appear in the 1.16.2 -> 1.17 map: that map
is keyed on `.pdata` function starts, and `scripts/select-needed-1170-rows.py` could not see them.
They were invisible to every tool the migration has.

THE RULE
========
Name the CONTAINING FUNCTION and add the offset at the use site, then resolve through
`er_game_base::game_build::resolve_call_site_rva` (or `resolve_call_site_band` for a window):

    // before -- unmappable, and silent when it stops matching
    const FOO_CALLER_RVA: usize = 0x744e02;
    if caller_rva == FOO_CALLER_RVA { ... }

    // after -- the function is mappable, the offset rides along, a refusal is logged
    const FOO_FN_RVA: usize = 0x744dd0;
    const FOO_CALL_OFFSET: usize = 0x32;
    if resolve_call_site_rva(FOO_FN_RVA, FOO_CALL_OFFSET, "FOO_FN_RVA") == Some(caller_rva) { ... }

`scripts/derive-callsite-1170.py <addr>` prints the evidence for the split: the `.pdata` record
containing the address, the map's pair for that function, and the callee each image's `E8` reaches
at the same offset.

WHY NOT JUST PUT THE RETURN ADDRESS IN THE MAP
==============================================
Because a verdict-table row licenses a DETOUR. `DETOURABLE_ENTRY_EVIDENCE` in
`er-game-base/build.rs` accepts `NEITHER-ENTRY` -- deliberately, for a pair that sits the same
distance before a Ghidra-named entry in both images -- so a row for a mid-function address would
be accepted into `DETOUR_SAFE_1162_TO_1170` and MinHook would then write five bytes into the
middle of a live function. Resolving the function and adding the offset in Rust keeps the offset
out of every table.
