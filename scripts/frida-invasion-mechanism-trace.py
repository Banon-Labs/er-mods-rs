"""Decide, in one Seamless invasion, WHICH code picks where an invader lands.

THE QUESTION
------------
Static RE of the invasion path finishes at roughly 92%. The readable part says the destination is
chosen entirely on the INVADER'S OWN MACHINE:

    GetNpcWorldInvasionInfo  0x1405ee3d0   walks the MSB `PseudoMultiplayer` regions and returns the
                                           first one geometrically containing the invader
    ReqInvadeNPCWorld        0x1409fafe0   receives that record; `+0x28` names the destination map,
                                           `+0x14` names the MSB entry point to spawn on

The unreadable part is Seamless. `ersc.dll` has its own invade site and its own spawn-position
writer, and the half that offers/accepts an invasion is inside the Themida VM. So the ONE thing
that cannot be settled by reading bytes is whether a Seamless invasion travels the vanilla path at
all -- and everything downstream depends on the answer:

  * if it does, then WHERE YOU STAND selects your destination, because the MSB region containing
    the invader is the whole input; and
  * if it does not, then the destination arrives from Seamless's own code and no amount of
    map-side filtering on our side can steer it.

WHAT THIS WATCHES, and why
--------------------------
The destination the engine places an invader at lives in `CSGameMan+0xac8`, and in 1.16.2 exactly
TWO functions write it. That bounds the whole answer space, so the run watches the writers rather
than the value:

  SetTargetMapId  0x14067acf0  <- ReqInvadeNPCWorld     this machine's own MSB-region lookup
                               <- SetMultiplayJoinData  it arrived in multiplayer join data

A return address at each write says which one decided it, and the same is done for
`SetNPCInvadeTargetEntryPoint` 0x14067ad00 (`+0xaf0`). `ReqInvadeNPCWorld` itself is hooked too,
with its whole 48-byte `NpcWorldInvasionInfo` dumped, and its CALLER named -- because one of its
three callers is `DequeueCeremonyPacket`, i.e. a received packet, which is a different story from
the local path even when the same function runs.

ERSC IS NOT HOOKED, DELIBERATELY. Its addresses are confirmed -- bytes, `.pdata` RUNTIME_FUNCTION
and unwind data all agree -- but `ersc.dll` is WinLicense/Themida-protected, and nothing in the
static image establishes whether this build verifies its own `.text`. A frida Interceptor is an
inline patch, which is exactly what such a check exists to catch, so "safe" is unproven rather
than merely unlikely to bite. Seamless's effect is fully visible from the game side anyway: if it
writes the destination, the write still goes through one of the two hooked setters, and the return
address lands in `ersc.dll` and is reported as such.

READ-ONLY. Nothing is written and nothing is called. Every hook verifies the target's first bytes
against the value established by static RE before attaching, so a version drift fails loudly
instead of attaching to the middle of some other function.

REACHING THE PROCESS
--------------------
The game runs under Wine/Proton, so a Linux-side `frida.attach()` sees nothing. `frida-gadget.dll`
is loaded into the game as an me3 `[[natives]]` entry and listens on 127.0.0.1:27042; this
connects to it as a REMOTE DEVICE. Launch with a gadget-bearing profile:

    /home/banon/Elden/pr190-invasion-warp-seamless-frida.me3

RUN IT (frida is provisioned per-run by uv; nothing is installed system-wide):

    uv run --with frida python3 \
        /home/banon/projects/er-effects-rs/scripts/frida-invasion-mechanism-trace.py

SELFTEST (no game, no frida -- proves the verdict logic):

    python3 /home/banon/projects/er-effects-rs/scripts/frida-invasion-mechanism-trace.py --selftest

// the entire answer space: a destination either came from this machine's own MSB lookup, or it
// arrived in multiplayer JOIN DATA. The return address says which, every time.
//
// WHY NOT HOOK ersc.dll. Its addresses are confirmed (bytes, .pdata RUNTIME_FUNCTION and unwind
// data all agree), but ersc.dll is WinLicense/Themida-protected -- a 5.3 MB RWX `.themida` section,
// the PE exception directory rebuilt inside it, "WinLicenseVersion" embedded in the entry stub --
// and NOTHING in the static image establishes whether this build enables memory-integrity checking
// over `.text`. A frida Interceptor is exactly the inline patch such a check exists to catch, so
// "safe" is unproven, not merely unlikely to bite. There is also an unresolved hook-ordering
// collision: ersc installs its 0x8f4b0 routine as the detour over the game's spawn-position
// selector FUN_140afcf60, which this repo's own coordinate-free warp already depends on.
// Watching ersc's EFFECT from the game side costs nothing and touches no protected page.
//
// Each is a 16-byte leaf: mov rax,[rip+..] ; mov edx,[rcx] ; mov [rax+off],edx ; ret -- which is
