"""Say whether an address is a function ENTRY, a LEAF with no unwind data, or MID-FUNCTION.

WHY THIS EXISTS, and why the verdict table cannot answer it
-----------------------------------------------------------
`verify-rva-map-1170.py`'s last column has three states, and one of them is doing two
incompatible jobs. `BOTH-ENTRIES` means both images' `.pdata` declare a function start at the
address. `NEITHER-ENTRY` means neither does -- and that covers two populations that could not be
more different:

  * a LEAF function. The x64 ABI lets a function omit unwind data when it allocates no stack and
    calls nothing, so ELDEN RING's many small getters and `jmp` thunks have no `.pdata` row at
    all. Hooking one is fine.
  * an address in the MIDDLE of a function. A captured return address, a byte-patch site, a
    constant that was derived by subtracting a dump shift that did not apply. Hooking one means
    MinHook overwrites five bytes mid-body.

`er-game-base/build.rs` accepts `NEITHER-ENTRY` for detours on purpose -- refusing it would throw
away every legitimate leaf -- so the second population is licensed along with the first, and
nothing downstream re-checks. MEASURED 2026-08-30, during the wave-2 merge: SIX mid-function
addresses reached or nearly reached the verified table carrying `IDENTICAL` over 20-94
instructions and `NEITHER-ENTRY`. Two were already merged -- `0x958b37` (+0x227 inside
`0x958910..0x958c4f`) and `0xaec480` (below). Four more (`0x7642b0`, `0x76432c`, `0x7acbf0`, `0xc57670`) were in the next batch and were refused by hand. Every
one clears `MIN_VERIFIED_INSNS`, because being mid-function does not make the surrounding code
differ -- it makes the comparison agree beautifully about the wrong thing.

READ THAT LAST SENTENCE AGAIN BEFORE TRUSTING A CLEAN VERDICT. A mid-function address produces a
*better-looking* verdict than a real entry does: it sits in the middle of a stable neighbourhood,
so the normalised comparison runs long and agrees everywhere. `0x140aec480` verified `IDENTICAL
1.000` over 56 instructions and was merged. It is +0x360 inside `0x140aec120..0x140aec567`, the
repo had ALREADY recorded that (`crates/er-title-flow/src/title_load_step_hooks.rs` names the real
entry `0x140aec570`), and `crates/er-reload-trace/src/lib.rs` carried a raw `rva: 0xaec480`
HookSpec that would have consumed the licence -- removed the same day by a different agent, which
is not a mechanism anyone should rely on twice.

The inversion in one line: that impostor row is `IDENTICAL` over 56 instructions and would carry a
detour, while the CORRECT pair `0xaec570 -> 0xaed880` is `IDENTICAL` over 9 and is refused one by
`MIN_VERIFIED_INSNS`. Verdict quality is not hook-target validity, and no number of matching
instructions is.

The distinguishing question is not "is there a `.pdata` row AT this address" but "is this address
INSIDE some other function's declared extent". That is what this answers.
