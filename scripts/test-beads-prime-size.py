"""Gate: the SessionStart / PreCompact prime hook must stay small enough to be SEEN.

Claude Code inlines a hook's stdout only up to a few KB. Past that it writes the whole
thing to `tool-results/hook-<uuid>-stdout.txt` and shows a 2 KB preview -- so an
oversized prime hook is worse than no prime hook: the content does not reach the agent
AND it costs a large chunk of every session, PreCompact included. That is exactly what
happened at 2452 memories: 157.4 KB, persisted, unread.

The size therefore has to be a GATE, not a habit. This drives the real
scripts/gen-beads-prime.py against a synthetic store far larger than the live one and
asserts (a) the output fits the budget, (b) it still teaches memory discovery, (c) the
full title list is preserved on disk, and (d) a broken/absent bd degrades instead of
breaking the hook.

`bd` is injected via BD_REAL_BIN, so this runs anywhere -- no beads install, no db.
