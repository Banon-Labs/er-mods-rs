"""Report which files in an OUTSIDE checkout differ from a commit in THIS repo, by content.

The companion to `compare-worktree-trees.py`, and it exists for the same reason: a
worktree-isolated agent cannot run `git -C` against a sibling checkout, but it can read that
checkout's bytes and ask its own repository what the shared base commit holds.

    python3 scripts/compare-tree-to-commit.py <commit> <other-checkout-root> <subpath> [subpath ...]

Prints one line per path whose content differs from the commit's blob, then a count.
