"""Wait for a launched run to end, then remove exactly what it staged.

Runs DETACHED from whatever launched it (own session, no controlling terminal), because the
game routinely outlives the shell -- and, in an agent session, the turn -- that started it. A
reaper tied to that lifetime would be killed at the moment it became useful.

It is the FAST path, not the guarantee. It can still be SIGKILLed, the machine can reboot, and
`scripts/er-stale-run-sentinel.sh` can tear the game down from a PostToolUse hook without ever
telling it. The guarantee is that `er-run-branch.py` garbage-collects every dead run's state
before staging a new one, so a leftover survives at most until the next launch. Both paths call
the same idempotent `RunState.cleanup()`.

Waiting is event-driven: a pidfd via `select`, never a poll loop with sleeps.

Usage (normally spawned by er-run-branch.py, not by hand):
    python3 scripts/er-run-reaper.py --run-id <id> [--place-monitor <name>]
    python3 scripts/er-run-reaper.py --selftest
