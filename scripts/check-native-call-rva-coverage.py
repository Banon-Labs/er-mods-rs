r"""Fail when a crate CALLS game functions that the 1.17 address map cannot answer.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
On 2026-08-30 a user pressed "Load Build from URL" and the importer did nothing. It also
pressed "Generate Build Link" and got a build with no items in it. Neither surface reported a
problem: the telemetry said `imported_count=2, accepted_count=2, failed_count=0`.

The cause was one fact nobody could see at build time. `er-build-import-runtime` calls 27 game
functions, and every one of its constants is named without `RVA` in it --
`GET_WEAPON_NAME`, `SET_REINFORCEMENT`, `EQUIP_ITEM_TO_CHR_ASM_SLOT`. Every tool in this repo
that decides which addresses to translate keyed on the constant NAME, so all 27 were invisible:
never selected, never mapped, never verified. On 1.17 the running game refused all of them.

Refusing was CORRECT -- calling a stale address transfers control into whatever moved there --
and the refusal was even logged. It was logged into a 2.3-million-line runtime log that somebody
has to launch the game to produce. Sixteen `ADDRESS REFUSED` lines, six of them the item-name
getters, and the consequence of those six was total: every item name failed to resolve, so
`read_character.rs:812` dropped all 18 equipped items, so the export was empty and the import had
nothing to apply.

That is the gap this closes. Two facts were in the tree the whole time -- "this crate calls game
address X" and "X is not in the map" -- and no gate put them next to each other. The failure
class is not new either: `select-needed-1170-rows.py` documents three earlier instances of it in
its own comments (`_BOUND` suffixes, enum aliases, bare `rva:` fields). This was the fourth.

WHAT IT IS NOT
==============
* Not `check-detour-rva-coverage.py`. That gates DETOURS against the stricter detour map. Every
  address here is a direct CALL and never goes near MinHook; the two maps are different sets and
  a row can be callable without being detourable.
* Not `verify-rva-map-1170.py`. That asks whether a mapped destination is the RIGHT function.
  This asks the prior question -- whether there is a destination at all.

THE VOCABULARY IS DERIVED, NEVER TRANSCRIBED
============================================
The map file paths and the refuted-verdict word are PARSED out of `crates/er-game-base/build.rs`,
because that file is what actually assembles the table the DLL consults. The resolver entry
points come from `scripts/rva_usage.py`, which reads them off the call sites. Addresses are
resolved from names by `scripts/rva_symbols.py`, which evaluates declarations to NUMBERS and so
sees enum aliases and derived constants no `_RVA` regex would.

AND THE LEDGER SET IS DISCOVERED BY PATH, NOT BY THE SPELLING OF A RUST CONSTANT (fixed 2026-08-31)
Discovery used to be `const (\w*MAP\w*): &str = "..."`. `QUARANTINE` -- the ledger whose rows
`build.rs` REMOVES from the translation table -- has no `MAP` in its name, so this gate never
opened it, and an address deliberately WITHDRAWN from the table was reported COVERED. Nothing
looked wrong only because that ledger has no data rows yet: the first row anybody writes there is
a call this gate licenses while the running game refuses it, which is the 2026-08-30 defect above
with the evidence already written down and still unread. A name filter standing in for a semantic
test is the same substitution all four historical misses were made of.

What replaced it: every `const NAME: &str` whose VALUE points into `docs/recon/*.tsv` is a ledger,
whatever it is called; its ROLE (seeded, subtracted, or deliberately unwired) is read off what
`build.rs` does with it -- `let _ = AUDITED_DETOURS;` is unwired, and a ledger reached from the
`held_back` construction without a verdict test is a quarantine. And because a widened regex can
still miss a file, the parse is checked against the DISK: every
`docs/recon/rva-map-1162-to-1170*.tsv` and `docs/recon/rva-1170-*.tsv` must be accounted for by
name or pinned in `LEDGERS_NOT_BUILD_INPUTS` with a reason, and an unaccounted one is a
`VocabularyError` rather than a silent omission.

Nine audits in this repo have printed a confident ZERO because they transcribed a literal that
later drifted -- `verified_rvas()` filtered on `"IDENTICAL"` and matched 0 of 99 rows, and
`check-rva-alias-drift.py` then ran `assert bad == 0` over an empty set and PASSED. So this
script prints COVERAGE rather than a bare verdict, and holds a frozen floor under the control
crate: if the matcher is ever blinded, the count collapses and the floor fails, instead of an
empty set reporting a clean tree.
