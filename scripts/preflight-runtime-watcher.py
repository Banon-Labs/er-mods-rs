"""Offline preflight for the runtime-probe harness, run BEFORE spending an Elden Ring launch.

Why this exists: a watcher edit that did `telemetry.get(...)` on a None telemetry crashed the
readiness watcher at runtime and burned a full gated ER launch (the game booted and closed in
seconds) to discover a pure-Python harness bug. A runtime launch is expensive (boot time, the
user watching, save-safety stakes) and must never be spent to surface an offline-checkable defect.

This validator:
  1. py_compiles every probe Python script and `bash -n`-checks the probe shell scripts.
  2. Imports er-readiness-watch.py and exercises EVERY `telemetry_*` decision helper against the
     telemetry states a real run actually produces -- None (file not written yet), {} (empty),
     and representative oracle payloads -- asserting none raise (the exact failure mode that
     escaped before, because the inline check skipped the helper pattern's None guard).

Exit non-zero on any failure so the launcher can fail closed before launching the game.
