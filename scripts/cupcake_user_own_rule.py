"""Classify a closing message that hands the user back a rule the user wrote.

# The failure

2026-09-23. A turn ended: "It stays draft -- undrafting is yours." The user had authored that rule
themselves, in a memory and in the global policy that denies `gh pr ready`. Their reply is the rule
this file makes executable:

    "If undrafting is mine, because I told you it was mine, does it need to be stated? Is there a
     way to guard against you telling me details that I provided to you through rego policies and
     agent instructions that I already knew?"

The sentence carried nothing. The user knew who undrafts, because they are the one who decided it;
reading it back spends their attention confirming their own instruction and crowds out the one
paragraph they actually read.

# What is flagged, and what deliberately is not

Only ownership restatement: a clause that assigns an action to the user, or denies it to the agent,
where the assignment comes from a standing rule the user authored. "Undrafting is yours." "I don't
push." "Leaving it draft for you."

Three things are deliberately left alone, because each carries something the user does not have:

  * A report that a guard fired. "The body guard forced two rewrites" is news -- it happened during
    this turn and they were not watching.
  * The exact command. `AGENTS.md` positively requires handing the user the pasteable command for
    work the agent may not do, spelled absolutely; a guard that made that unspeakable would delete
    one instruction to satisfy another.
  * Naming what is unpushed and on which branch. Same paragraph of `AGENTS.md`: that is a fact
    about the tree, not a recital of the rule.

So the line this draws is between the fact and the rule. `PR #481: <url>` is a fact. "It stays
draft because undrafting is yours" is a rule the user is being read their own copy of.

Quoted spans are stripped before matching, so a report about this guard -- this docstring, the
policy, a message explaining the halt -- cannot trip it.
