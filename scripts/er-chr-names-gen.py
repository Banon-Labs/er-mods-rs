"""Generate the shipped `er-npc-possess` creature-name table.

`data/moveset.tbl` is integers only and says so in its own header: it is a set of
decisions about animation ids, and an animation id is a BND entry filename. That was
enough for the moveset layer, which never had to put a creature in front of a person.
A PICKER does. `c4630` is not a thing anybody can choose from a list of four hundred;
`Runebear` is.

WHERE THE NAMES COME FROM, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE GAME'S OWN STRINGS. The obvious
source is `NpcName.fmg` out of `item.msgbnd`, and it is the wrong one: it holds the
strings the game DISPLAYS, which means bosses and named NPCs and nothing else. Measured
over the 408 creatures the moveset table covers, `NpcName.fmg` reaches 73. Routing
`NpcParam.nameId` into it reaches 30. The overwhelming majority of the creatures a
player would want to wear -- every wolf, every soldier, every knight -- have no
displayable name in the game at all, because the game never shows one.

So the names here are the PARAMDEX/SMITHBOX ROW NAMES: community-authored labels for
param rows, which exist precisely because the rows themselves are anonymous. Two
files, in priority order:

  ChrModelParam   row id IS the chr id. 256/408, and they are the clean ones --
                  "Flying Dragon", not "Flying Dragon Agheel (Limgrave)".
  NpcParam        row id is chrid*10000 + variant. 405/408, with location and
                  scaling qualifiers attached. Used only where ChrModelParam is blank.

Combined: 405 of 408. The three that neither names (5194, 5261, 6240) ship as `-`,
and the picker shows `c5194` for them rather than inventing a name.

THIS IS NOT A GAME ASSET AND IS NOT A GAME BYTE. Nothing here is read out of
`regulation.bin`, out of a `.dcx`, or out of the running game. The input is a JSON file
of English labels a community wrote to make an anonymous table navigable, and the
output is the same labels keyed by the ids this crate already ships. `regulation.bin`
is not opened by this script at all.

Usage:
  scripts/er-chr-names-gen.py --out crates/er-npc-possess/data/chrnames.tbl
  scripts/er-chr-names-gen.py --selftest       # no corpus needed
  scripts/er-chr-names-gen.py --report         # coverage, to stdout, writes nothing

Override the row-name checkout with ER_PARAM_ROWNAME_DIR, the same variable
`scripts/er-param-read.py` reads.
