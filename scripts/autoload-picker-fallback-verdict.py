"""RAM verdict for the autoload -> save-picker fallback (user 2026-08-26).

Scores ONE runtime run purely from `oracle_*` telemetry. No screenshots, no user
adjudication: the run either shows the dead end becoming a picker and the pick
superseding it, or it does not.

The feature under test: when the autoload finds its Continue slot unloadable it must
REJECT the save, arm the picker LATE (post-boot), and let the pick supersede the bad
selection. The old behavior spun on that branch forever, so "picker armed at boot"
is NOT this feature -- arming must happen strictly AFTER the first rejection, which
is why every gate below is ordered against the rejection row.

Usage:
