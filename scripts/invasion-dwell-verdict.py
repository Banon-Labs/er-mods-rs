"""Decide whether a Seamless session state's dwell is a FRAME COUNT, a WALL CLOCK, or neither.

Reads `er-invasion-warp.log` and looks at the transition lines the DLL emits:

    local-invasion: session state 0x0e (unreversed) -> 0x11 (unreversed) -- held 612 ticks / 10203ms (~59 fps)

The interesting one is `0x11`, Seamless's no-match retry wait. Whether that wait is counted in
FRAMES or in SECONDS decides whether raising the frame rate would shorten it -- the difference
between "run the game faster while hunting" being a real lever and being void.

WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS RATHER THAN AN EYEBALL
---------------------------------------------
An earlier reading of "600 ticks, nine times, zero variance" was taken from a heartbeat that fires
every 600 ticks unconditionally -- it measured the logger's own period and was mistaken for a
measurement of the game. Eyeballing a column of numbers is exactly how that happens.

THE METHOD: whichever quantity the timer counts is the one it holds constant, while the other is
forced to absorb every wobble in frame rate. So the two columns are compared on RELATIVE spread
and the tighter one names the mechanism. This works even when the frame rate barely moves -- a
small fps spread shrinks both columns' variation without changing the ratio between them, which
is the quantity the inference actually rests on.

Measured live 2026-08-06 on six `0x11` dwells: wall clock 15003ms +/-0.22%, ticks 844 +/-2.64%.
The clock is ~12x tighter, and the tick range a fixed 15.0s interval predicts (812-875) matches
the observed range (814-876). Seamless's retry is a wall-clock timer; frame rate cannot shorten
it.

    and the `held` figure is how long the state on the LEFT was occupied -- the DLL stamps the
    interval since the previous transition, which is the interval during which it sat in `0x11`.
