"""The policies must be tested against the input the ENGINE DELIVERS.

WHY THIS GATE EXISTS (2026-08-31). `.cupcake/tests/*_test.rego` runs in the OPA
interpreter, which feeds a policy whatever text the test author typed. Cupcake
does not deliver that text. Before a single policy runs it ENRICHES the event,
and two of those enrichments change the answer:

  * `whitespace_normalization` collapses every run of unquoted whitespace --
    newlines included -- to one space, and trims the ends. A multi-line command
    therefore arrives as ONE line, so any rule that locates something by line
    position is inert in production;
  * the Rust preprocessor OVERWRITES `affected_parent_directories` with its own
    answer whenever that answer is non-empty, so a hand-written fixture for that
    field is silently discarded.

Both defects were live and both suites were green. `command_operand_region` in
protected_paths.rego split the command on "\\n" to find heredoc payload and had
been dead since 2026-07-29 -- `lines` is always one element -- while its own
regressions passed, because they fed raw multi-line text the engine never
delivers. `test_deny_root_delete_inside_command_substitution` hand-fed
`affected_parent_directories: ["/"]` for `echo $(rm -rf /)` and passed, while the
same command was ALLOWED through the real binary, because the preprocessor
actually reports `["<cwd>/$(rm", "/)"]`.

A dead rule whose tests are green is indistinguishable from a working one. That
is the whole problem, and it is why this file measures rather than assumes.

WHAT IT CHECKS

  1. ENRICHMENT CONTRACT. Every transform the engine applies, pinned by
     measurement. If a cupcake upgrade changes one, this goes red -- instead of
     silently resurrecting a dead rule, or killing a live one.

  2. THE SHARED CASE TABLE. `delivered_cases` in protected_paths_test.rego is
     consumed here as well as by `opa test`: this runner sends each command
     through the real binary, lets the ENGINE compute `affected_parent_directories`,
     and asserts the fixture recorded in the table is what the engine actually
     produced. A fixture production never produces now fails.

  3. DEAD-LOGIC INVENTORY. Each helper known to be unreachable in production is
     asserted unreachable, by measurement, so the inventory cannot rot into
     folklore -- and so that anyone who "fixes" the engine finds out here.

  4. THE PRODUCTION PATH. `scripts/test-cupcake-policies.py` calls `cupcake eval`
     DIRECTLY, which is not how any command reaches the guards: Claude Code runs
     `scripts/cupcake-hook.sh`, which rewrites every unquoted newline to `; `
     before the engine sees it. That rewrite is the ONLY reason multi-line
     commands are still guarded at all, and no policy suite exercises it. These
     cases run the shim end to end.

Nothing here executes any command under test. Every command is data, handed to a
policy engine as text; the subject matter is commands that must never run.

Run with --selftest to prove the detector still catches the original defect.

# `.git/hooks/` -- was configured in .cupcake/rulebook.yml with a message and a
# protected_paths list, and it had never run once. cupcake 0.5.2 treats a builtin
# as DISABLED unless its block carries an explicit `enabled: true`, so the engine
# logged `Skipping disabled builtin policy` and the rulebook's own comment
# ("Builtins are ENABLED BY DEFAULT when configured") was simply false.
#
# An agent editing `.cupcake/` all session believed it was locked down. Nothing
# in either test suite could have told it otherwise, because a policy that is
# never compiled produces no decisions -- and no decisions is indistinguishable
# from a clean event.
#
# So the mechanism is pinned here by MEASUREMENT, in both directions: the live
# tree must not enable it, and a copy differing by that one line must deny what
# the live tree allows. If a cupcake upgrade changes the default, or someone adds
# the key, this goes red and the decision recorded in .cupcake/rulebook.yml gets
# re-made deliberately instead of drifting.
