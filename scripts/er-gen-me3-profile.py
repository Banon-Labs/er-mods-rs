"""Write the two files a branch launch needs: an me3 profile, and the DLL's per-run sidecar.

Nothing here touches shared state. The profile is a fresh temp file the run owns outright,
and the save selection goes into `<dll-stem>.toml` beside the staged DLL rather than into the
game directory's `er-quickload.toml` -- which is hand-edited, shared across every launch, and
outlives every run.

ersc.dll is always listed
------------------------
Seamless Co-op's presence is what selects the DLL's container mode: `save_picker_seamless_mode
_after_settle` reads the `seamless_coop_loaded()` PEB latch, and Seamless mode accepts both
`ER0000.co2` and `ER0000.sl2` (preferring the co-op one), while vanilla accepts only `.sl2`.
Listing ersc therefore makes the whole 89-save corpus reachable instead of the 70 `.sl2` ones.
The entry references the game-installed DLL and never copies it: bundling or staging
`SeamlessCoop/ersc.dll` is forbidden in this repo.

`--vanilla` drops the entry for changes that touch the vanilla-only save path, which the
Seamless branch would otherwise never exercise.

The header is evidence, not decoration
--------------------------------------
Every generated profile carries what the run was: branch, merge-base, dirty flag, each DLL's
sha256, the DLLs that were excluded and why, the decoded character, the RNG seed, and the
evidence class. A profile found later on disk should answer "what was this?" without needing
the session that made it.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/er-gen-me3-profile.py --closure closure.json --save save.json \\
        --run-id r-123 --profile out.me3 [--vanilla]
