# Install the repo's version-controlled git hooks. TWO THINGS GET INSTALLED, and the second one is
# the reason this script is not a one-liner any more:
#
#   1. core.hooksPath -> scripts/hooks. The normal path: git runs scripts/hooks/<name> directly.
#      Relative on purpose, so it survives a rename of the checkout and is correct inside every
#      linked worktree (git resolves it against that worktree's top-level).
#
#   2. scripts/hooks-fallback-shim -> $GIT_COMMON_DIR/hooks/<name>, for each hook in scripts/hooks/.
#      This is the directory git uses when core.hooksPath is UNSET, and it is not version
#      controlled. It held a 537-byte block-main-only pre-push from 2026-07-27 which ran neither
#      scripts/check-committed-compiles.sh nor scripts/check.sh; on 2026-08-31 a push
#      reached origin through it while core.hooksPath was briefly gone. core.hooksPath is not a
#      key this repo owns alone -- beads writes it too (`bd hooks install|uninstall`, `bd doctor`;
#      see the header of scripts/hooks-fallback-shim for the binary's own strings) -- so the
#      fallback has to be as strong as the gate rather than a weaker copy of it.
#
# Idempotent; safe to re-run, and re-running is the documented repair. bd
# static-guards-run-in-build-format-cycle-precommit-hook-2026-07-19.
