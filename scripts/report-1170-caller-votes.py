"""Print the FULL vote tally behind a `map-data-rvas-1162-to-1170.py` carry verdict.

`CONTESTED 2 answers from 651 callers` is not a usable verdict on its own: it does not say
whether the split is 650-to-1 -- one caller whose body was edited, so the answer is obvious --
or 320-to-331, where the address genuinely forked and no answer is safe. This prints the tally
so a reader can tell those apart, and the delta each candidate implies, because a runner-up
that is NOT at the region's delta is the signature of a decode that slipped inside one edited
caller rather than of a second real function.

THREE KINDS OF VOTE, AND THE TWO THIS TOOL WAS BLIND TO UNTIL 2026-08-30
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It counted `call`/`jmp` sites and nothing else, so it could only ever answer for a function
something BRANCHES to. Every function whose address is merely TAKEN -- stored into a `std::function`
/ functor, parked in a dispatch table, compared against a field -- was invisible, and the tool
said `None ... 0 real` about it in the same words it uses for an address nothing references at
all. That is not a rare shape in ELDEN RING's menu code; it is how most of it is written.

`MENU_ITEM_ACCEPT_IDLE_RVA` (1.16.2 `0x7add70`) is the measured case. Nothing calls it: it is a
3-byte `xor eax,eax; ret` whose address a `CS::MenuItem` row carries at `+0xf8` as its
constant-false accept predicate. The whole 1.16.2 image contains exactly ONE reference to it, a
`lea` -- so the old tool reported `None (1 candidate branch site, 0 real)` and no instrument in
this tree could map the address. The same `lea` is the whole answer: it sits at byte `+0xa5` of
`0x7acf80`, whose 1.17 pair is known, and reading the paired instruction there gives `0x7aebf0`.

So three carriers run, and they stay SEPARATE in the output. They are different evidence and a
reader must be able to weigh them apart:

  * `call/jmp`      -- `carry_code`: a branch at instruction N of a mapped caller.
  * `address-taken` -- `carry`: a rip-relative displacement (a `lea`, or any `mov`/`cmp` reaching
    the address) at the same byte offset of a mapped referrer. This is the carrier the data map
    already used for globals; a function pointer is carried by exactly the same arithmetic.
  * `pointer-table` -- an 8-byte absolute `BASE + rva` stored in `.rdata`/`.data`: a vtable slot
    or a function-pointer table. Carried by its NEIGHBOURS in the same table, each of which is a
    code pointer the function map answers for, so the table is located in 1.17 by content rather
    than by address.

AND THE STRENGTH THAT `WEAK` HIDES. `carry`'s vocabulary calls a single reference WEAK, which is
right when an address has fifty references and one of them survived the decode -- it means the
other forty-nine were lost. It is the wrong word when the address HAS exactly one reference in
each image: `1-of-1` in both directions is unanimity, not a fragment. The reverse check below
distinguishes them by counting references to the ANSWER in 1.17, and reports `UNANIMOUS 1-of-1`
only when both counts are 1.
