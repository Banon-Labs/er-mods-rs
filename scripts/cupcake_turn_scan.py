"""ONE definition of "what did the last assistant turn actually do", shared by the Stop-hook signals.

Every `.cupcake/signals/last_assistant_*.sh` that has to answer "did that turn do real work, or did it
just talk?" used to answer it with its own private copy of the same code. Two copies are two rules:
they drift, and then two guards disagree about the same turn. This module is the single owner --
`.cupcake/signals/last_assistant_idle_hold.sh` and `.cupcake/signals/last_assistant_unexecuted_promise.sh`
both import it, so a fix to the peek-command list or the blocked-on-user phrasing lands in both at once.

What lives here (and NOWHERE else):
  * transcript discovery         -- `latest_transcript`
  * turn bucketing               -- `split_turns`; a turn is bounded by REAL user prompts, and a
                                    tool-result carrier "user" event does NOT split one
  * substantive work vs peeking  -- `bash_is_status_peek`, `Turn.work`
  * blocked-on-the-user prose    -- `USER_WAIT_RE`, `blocked_on_user`
  * live background work         -- `live_background_work`: a backgrounded Bash or an async Agent
                                    launch that has not reported back yet, and whether the current
                                    turn is the one that started it
  * where a paragraph starts     -- `prose_paragraphs`, and `Turn.text_runs`, the contiguous prose
                                    runs a length rule must measure instead of the whole turn

Signal-SPECIFIC prose classification (which phrases are banned, how long is too long) stays in the
individual signal: that is the part each guard genuinely owns.

Import contract: every consumer must fail OPEN (emit nothing) if this module cannot be imported, so a
missing/renamed file can never wedge a session.

    carried by it, it is being deferred behind it -- the exact disappearance the promise guard exists
    to stop, and measured on the real transcript that prompted the guard, where a game launch two
    lines earlier would otherwise have excused it. Live work covers a promise only when the promise
    WAITS ON that work ("once it lands", "whatever it finds", "if it flags") or when the live thing is
    a `watcher`.

    Otherwise deliberately GENEROUS -- every branch here suppresses a halt, so a false "something is running" is
    a quiet non-event while a false "nothing is running" would accuse an agent that did cover itself.
    Three sources, all read straight out of the transcript:

      * a Bash tool_use with `run_in_background: true` whose tool_result has not arrived (the harness
        delivers that result when the command exits, so a missing one means it is still going);
      * an Agent tool_use whose result said "Async agent launched" and for which no
        `<task-notification>` with a finished `<status>` has arrived;
      * a foreground Bash call in the last turn that detached a process itself (nohup/setsid/`&`), or
        a Monitor/SendMessage call, which wake or watch work that outlives the turn.

    BUT ONLY RECENTLY LAUNCHED WORK COUNTS (RECENT_TURNS). A launch whose completion never made it
    into the transcript -- the notification was dropped, the session was resumed into a new file, the
    task was killed -- would otherwise stay "pending" forever and silently exempt every turn after it
    for the rest of the session. Measured on real transcripts: ONE subagent launched at line 658 and
    never notified suppressed the guard across the remaining 2,800 lines, including the exact turn the
    guard exists to catch. A guard that quietly stops firing is worse than one that never shipped, so
    a launch older than RECENT_TURNS turns is treated as finished. Genuine long-running work is
    re-covered every turn it is still waited on in prose, and ten turns of conversation is far longer
