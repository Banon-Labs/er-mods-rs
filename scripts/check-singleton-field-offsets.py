"""Prove every repo STRUCT-FIELD OFFSET that a singleton reaches is still a field on 1.17.

WHY THIS EXISTS -- THE ONE SILENT FAILURE CLASS
-----------------------------------------------
The 1.16.2 -> 1.17 migration has three ways to be wrong about an address, and only two of them
say anything:

  * a stale DETOUR target        -> `er-hook` refuses the address and logs `HOOK REFUSED`;
  * an unmapped CALL/data RVA    -> the resolver returns 0 and the caller reports it;
  * a stale STRUCT FIELD OFFSET  -> `*(this + 0xNN)` returns the NEIGHBOURING field.

The third one has no refusal, no fault and no log line. It returns a plausible number of the
right width, forever. `crates/er-reload-trace/src/lib.rs` already records the shape in miniature:
the DLUID global moved 0x485dc18 -> 0x4861d28 and the read against the OLD slot still
"succeeded" -- it returned a byte from whatever now lives there.

Nothing in this repo checked field offsets against 1.17 until the 2026-08-30 audit, and the audit
found the cheapest possible oracle sitting unused.

THE MECHANISM (no dataflow, no RTTI pairing, no heuristics)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Find `mov r64, [rip+disp32]` whose target is a KNOWN SINGLETON GLOBAL, then take any
`[reg + 0xNN]` in the next few instructions, before that register is written again. The base
register PROVABLY holds that singleton -- the instruction two lines up loaded it. So the
displacement is an object-level ground truth: it is a real field offset of whatever class lives
in that global, in that image, with no inference in between.

Run it on both flat de-Arxan'd images (file offset == RVA, base 0x140000000) and you get, per
object, the set of field offsets 1.16.2 reads and the set 1.17 reads. An offset the old image
reads and the new one never reads is a field that moved or vanished -- which is exactly the
silent failure, made loud.

Measured on the tracked objects today: NOT ONE of the 312 field offsets 1.16.2 reads through
these globals has disappeared in 1.17 (GameMan 159, GameDataMan 53, CSMenuManImp 44,
WorldChrManImp 18, SessionManager 16, CSFlipperImp 7, PlayerGameData 15 -- every one of them read
in both images), and neither image reads one the other does not. So the null result is a real
null result, measured, not an empty set: see FROZEN_FIELD_COUNTS for why it cannot silently
become one.

This paragraph used to read "314 ... GameMan 160 ... SessionManager gains one field in 1.17", and
that extra field was NOT A FIELD. `_follow` walked five instructions past the end of the function
holding the singleton load and collected whatever the NEXT function did with the register; the
1.17 SessionManager "+0x18" was a `lea edx, [rax + 0x18]` six bytes over the boundary. See
`_follow` for the three artefacts and for why the correct bound is the function extent, never a
byte or instruction count.

WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT COVER, SAID PLAINLY. Only 65 of the workspace's ~900 named offset constants
are cleared here. 713 have no owner this can establish, 112 have an owner no singleton reaches
(CS::ChrIns, the dialog layouts, Scaleform::MemoryFile, the FileCap family), and 13 belong to a
scanned object but are never read through the singleton in either image -- including
PLAYER_GAME_DATA_IS_MAIN_PLAYER_OFFSET 0x8f0, which the constructor and vtable routes used for
the pins in crates/er-game-base/src/pgd.rs DO witness. All of those are UNKNOWN. They are printed
as UNKNOWN, counted as UNKNOWN, and never rolled into the clean number.

ONE CHAIN HOP
-------------
`CS::PlayerGameData` is not in a global of its own -- it hangs off `GameDataMan + 0x8`
(`main_player_game_data`), which is the route 20+ live sites in this repo already take and the
one the sibling `fromsoftware-rs` binding declares. So a chain may carry hops: the scan follows
`mov r64,[rip+GameDataMan]; mov r64,[r64+0x8]` and then collects `[reg+0xNN]` off the RESULT.
A hop is only admissible when the hop offset is itself witnessed on the parent object in BOTH
images -- otherwise the hop is exactly the kind of unverified assumption this gate exists to
refuse -- and that admission is re-derived on every run, never asserted.

WHAT THIS GATE REPORTS, AND WHY IT REPORTS COVERAGE
----------------------------------------------------
Nine "audits" in this repo have reported zero findings while real findings stood, because a
matcher that goes blind produces an empty set and `assert bad == 0` passes over an empty set.
So this prints THREE numbers, not a verdict:

  * how many repo constants it CLEARED (offset witnessed on its owner in both images);
  * how many it could NOT attribute (no owner, or an owner no singleton reaches) -- these are
    UNKNOWN, never "fine";
  * how many field offsets each scanned object contributed, per image.

The per-object field counts depend ONLY on the two frozen images and this matcher, so they are
frozen EXACTLY (`FROZEN_FIELD_COUNTS`): a change to the matcher that blinds it moves them and
this gate goes red instead of reporting a smaller clean set. The cleared-constant floor
(`MIN_CLEARED_CONSTANTS`) carries headroom instead, because it also depends on repo source that
lands continuously, and a ratchet that goes red when somebody deletes a constant is a ratchet
people learn to ignore.

    it no longer holds the singleton), a branch, or a decode failure.

    THE FUNCTION END IS THE ONE THAT WAS MISSING, AND IT INVENTED FIELDS. The premise of this
    whole gate -- "the base register PROVABLY holds that singleton, the instruction two lines up
    loaded it" -- is a statement about STRAIGHT-LINE CODE INSIDE ONE FUNCTION. Past the `ret` it
    is simply false: control does not fall through, the register belongs to whoever comes next,

    RESYNCHRONISE into instructions nobody assembled. Three measured artefacts, all removed by
    the `body_end` stop below (2026-08-31):

      * SessionManager 1.17 `+0x18`. The load sits at 0x140257d0f inside a function ending at
        0x140257d22; the "read" is `lea edx, [rax + 0x18]` at 0x140257d28, SIX BYTES into the
        next function -- and a `lea` computing an address, not a field read, at that. It was the
        SOLE evidence for this file's headline claim that SessionManager gains a field in 1.17.
      * CS::GameMan `+0x0`, in BOTH images, from two sites each, every one past its function's
        end. 1.17's decode as `sar dword ptr [rax], 0x6f` and `and dword ptr [rax], esp`. This
        is the "vftable slot" the FOLLOW_INSNS table above used to cite as the reason a window of
        3 was too tight.
      * The `+0x3b` / `+0x73` junk the same table blamed on a branch JOIN at window 8. Also the
        next function.

    Being symmetric is no defence: `CS::PlayerGameData +0xe5` reads past the FIRST `.pdata` chunk
    in both images and looks clean because both images agree. It survives here only because
    `function_regions` MERGES CHUNK RUNS, so the read is genuinely inside the function -- which is
    exactly why the extent comes from the shared primitive and not from a local `.pdata` walk. A

# PGD EVIDENCE MODE (--pgd-offsets). NOT part of the gate: nothing here feeds a verdict or a
# frozen count. It exists so the offsets pinned in crates/er-game-base/src/pgd.rs can be
# RE-DERIVED, instead of resting on a one-off script somebody ran once and deleted.
#
# Three routes, each proving the base register holds a PlayerGameData without any cross-image
# function pairing. The sets are built per image and then intersected, so BOTH means 1.16.2 code
# and 1.17 code each read that offset as a PGD field:
#
#   A  the singleton chain, GameDataMan(global) -> +0x8 -> PGD  (the gate's own route)
#   B  functions called with that chain's PGD pointer still in an argument register, one deep
#   C  the CS::PlayerGameData constructor, the functions it calls with `this` in RCX, and the
#      methods of the two vtables it stores at [this+0]
#
# The constructor pair below was produced by scripts/map-rvas-1162-to-1170.py and is CHECKED here
# rather than trusted: each address must store both declared vtable pointers at [this+0], or this
# mode refuses to report. A drifted constructor address then says so instead of quietly scanning
# an unrelated function and printing a confident, wrong witness set.
