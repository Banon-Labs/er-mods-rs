# er-artifact-redirect: library
# This file RUNS the me3 command on a caller's behalf; it has no run of its own and no
# artifact dir. The ER_QUICKLOAD_*_PATH redirects that keep a run's evidence out of the
# single-slot game directory belong to each CALLER, which `scripts/er-artifact-redirect-audit.py`
# audits individually. Do not add a redirect list here -- it would silently override theirs.
# Shared me3 launch helpers. me3 is the ONLY supported loader for er_quickload.dll:
# the LazyLoader dinput8 proxy + lazyLoad.ini chainload delivery was removed 2026-07-04
# (branch feat/me3-launch-smoketest) after the me3 production smoke passed end-to-end
# (run me3-product-smoke-20260704-110507: DLL attach, env propagation, flag files,
# zero-input autoload to world-stable all proven through me3).
#
# Source this file; do not execute it. Callers own artifact dirs, env, backgrounding,
# and teardown. me3 launches Game/eldenring.exe directly through the Steam compat tool
# (waitforexitandrun verb) -- never a Steam AppID/URL form, never the EAC launcher.

# Refuse a launch whose changed code path has never been shown to execute.
#
# A launch takes the user's screen and produces one recording. Spending it on a predicate that
# cannot fire is worse than not launching: it returns a clean-looking run that proves nothing, and
# the absence of the expected log line reads as "the fix did not work" rather than "the fix could
# never have run". That happened on 2026-08-04 -- a disarm gated on `requestCode` latching 2 shipped
# and did nothing, because the state it was scoped to is DEFINED by `requestCode` staying 1, and the
# previous run's telemetry already said so.
#
# `scripts/er-launch-gate.py` checks that offline, against recordings that already exist, in
# milliseconds. Fail-closed: a gate that cannot read its evidence refuses.
#
# ER_LAUNCH_GATE_SKIP=1 bypasses it. That is for a launch which is NOT validating a code path (the
# user just wants to play, or a launch whose only purpose is to PRODUCE a first recording). It is
# not a way to launch a fix you have not shown can run -- the skip is logged so a run that used it
