  '- Load1 (fresh boot autoload) and Load2 (in-game System-Quit reload of the SAME save) run the world-res PopulateLists block-res builder with IDENTICAL input (count=111, SAME list ptr, area 0x1c present both). So the per-block WorldBlockRes (+0xce0) is built the same on both loads. POPULATE IS NOT THE DIVERGENCE.',
  '- Yet at the Load2 stall (STEP_WorldResWait / MoveMapStep child step 3): block 0x1c000000 EXISTS in the WorldInfo area-block list (worldres+0xb3030; oracle blk_found=1) but the blocks LOAD-STATE is NULL: reading the block entry vtable slot +0x10 getter (block->vtable[0x10](block)) returns 0 (oracle blk_ls=0). Per the check FUN_14066d4d0: if(loadstate==0) return 0 -> it bails forever. On Load1 the same getter returns non-null and the world loads.',
  '- CONCLUSION: on the 2nd load, block 0x1c000000 load is NEVER KICKED OFF -- its load-state object is never created -- even though the block object and its block-res exist. This matches the user report that a subsequent load REUSES the world for the same character and skips re-loading the block. Loading a DIFFERENT character first then this one also stalls, so it is a general resident/skip, not same-char specific.',
