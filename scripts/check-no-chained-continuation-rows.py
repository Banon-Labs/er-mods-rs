"""Refuse a map row whose address is an MSVC CHAINED-UNWIND continuation record.

WHAT THIS CATCHES THAT `classify-1170-entry-kind.py` DOES NOT
------------------------------------------------------------
That tool asks: does this image's `.pdata` declare a function to BEGIN here? It is the right
question, and it caught six mid-function rows on 2026-08-30. But `.pdata` answers "yes" for an
address that is NOT a function start.

MSVC splits one function's unwind data across several `RUNTIME_FUNCTION` records whenever it
outlines a cold path or a region-based unwind. Every chunk after the first gets its own record,
so it reads as `ENTRY` -- while being an address in the middle of a live function. Bit 2 of the
record's `UNWIND_INFO` flags nibble (`UNW_FLAG_CHAININFO`, 0x4) says which kind it is, and the
record it chains to owns the real prologue.

MEASURED, and this is why the distinction is not academic. `0xc57666` is the record covering the
`CSFreeListMemorySystem` shutdown assert. Both images' `.pdata` declare a function start there,
`classify-1170-entry-kind.py --fail-on-mid` passes it, and it is already paired in
`rva-map-1162-to-1170.functions.tsv` as `0xc57666 -> 0xc58d36`. It is a continuation: the real
function begins 0x86 bytes earlier, at `0xc575e0` (1.16.2) / `0xc58cb0` (1.17), and is vtable
slot 2 of `.?AVCSFreeListMemorySystem@CS@@` in both. A row for `0xc57666` would carry
`BOTH-ENTRIES`, clear every existing gate, and license MinHook to write five bytes 0x86 into a
function other threads are running.

The inverse case is why this cannot simply refuse short records. `0x8c47c0`
(`CS::FeSystemAnnounceView::Update`) has a SIX-byte `.pdata` record -- and it is a ROOT: the
6 bytes are `push rbx; sub rsp,0x30`, one more than MinHook needs, and the chained record at
`0x8c47c6` points back at it. Record size says nothing; the flag says everything.
