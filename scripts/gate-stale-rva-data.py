"""Route hand-built `base + SOME_RVA` DATA addresses through the 1.17 data map.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE TOOL FROM THE CALL ONE
---------------------------------------------
`gate-stale-rva-calls.py` handles addresses that get EXECUTED, where a refusal has to become a
control-flow decision (return what, exactly?) and the risk is deleting behaviour. Data addresses
have no such problem: `er_game_base::mem::game_data_addr` returns `0` when the running build has
no verified mapping, and every one of these sites is already a read or an identity compare with an
existing "not the object I wanted" branch. Handing it `0` puts a refusal down the path the caller
already had.

The hazard being fixed is the QUIET one. A stale data address does not crash -- the reads are
fault-safe -- so the comparison simply never matches and the feature behind it stops working with
nothing said. Measured 2026-08-29: `TITLE_OWNER_VTABLE_RVA` is `CS::TitleStep` in 1.16.2 and not a
vtable at all in 1.17, and its three scans had been finding no title owner, forever, silently.

ONLY CONSTANTS ONE OF THE FOUR LEDGERS IN `MAPS` ALREADY CARRIES are rewritten. A constant with no row would gain
nothing but noise: `game_data_addr` would return 0 where the raw value at least had a chance of
being right on some build. Getting the row is `map-data-rvas-1162-to-1170.py`'s job first.

WHICH CONSTANTS THOSE ARE WAS DECIDED BY A REGEX THAT COULD ONLY READ ONE SPELLING (fixed 2026-08-30)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`mapped_constants()` used to learn a constant's address from `const FOO_RVA: usize = 0x1234;` and
nothing else, and the comment beside that regex said so out loud: "a constant defined from an enum
discriminant has no value here and falls back to matching by NAME." Falling back to the name means
the constant is only ever recognised when a generator happened to write ITS name into a map's label
column -- and the labels are written from a different spelling of the same set, so most do not.

The code now knows what the comment knew. Values come from `scripts/rva_symbols.py`, which resolves
every declaration form this tree uses -- `: u32` / `: u64` as well as `: usize`, enum discriminants,
`const A: usize = B;` re-exports across crates, `use X as Y` aliases -- so "mapped" is decided by
the ADDRESS, which is what a map row is keyed on, instead of by the spelling.

MEASURED, on the tree as of 2026-08-30: 530 -> 728 constants recognised as mapped, and the sweep
went from 7 ungated data sites to 16. (728 -> 749 on 2026-08-31, when `needed.tsv` was added to
`MAPS` -- see the comment there. The site count did not move: all 21 of the newly-named constants
already resolved to addresses another ledger carried.) All nine of the newly-visible sites are real
raw
`base + FOO_RVA` reads whose constant is fully mapped and was invisible because it is declared by
derivation or as an enum discriminant:

    FILE_OPEN_RVA                    = er_game_base::rva::TITLE_SCALEFORM_FILE_OPEN_RVA
    PROFILE_SLOT_ACTIVATE_RVA        = ProfileLoadMenuRva::ProfileSlotActivate as usize
    NODE_FINALIZER_RVA               = er_game_base::rva::SL_RELEASE_REQUEST_RVA
    TITLE_CUSTOM_COVER_PROFILE_RENDER_INIT_RVA
                                     = er_loading_portrait_core::PROFILE_TABLE_BUILDER_RVA

Nothing was lost: the old set is a subset of the new one.

REPORTING IS THE DEFAULT; REWRITING TAKES `--write`
---------------------------------------------------
Inverted 2026-08-30. The old default was to REWRITE, and `--dry-run` was the flag you had to
remember -- which put the destructive action one forgotten word away, on a tool whose whole job is
editing source in bulk across the workspace. It cost exactly what it was always going to cost: an
agent ran the bare command while investigating, silently rewrote
`crates/er-quickload/src/experiments/trace/native_result_map_hooks.rs`, and had to `git checkout`
it back out. Nobody asks a scanner for a report and gets edits; they do the reverse by accident.
`--dry-run` is still accepted and still means "do not write", so old invocations keep working.

# `needed.tsv` WAS MISSING FROM THIS TUPLE while the comment above it claimed all three (fixed

# 357 source addresses put through the byte comparison, so the RVA half of the union was already
# complete -- but the two files' NAME columns are not the same set (414 labels against 394, 21 of
# them reachable only through `needed.tsv`), and nothing keeps them identical. The next `--refresh`
# that adds a row to one and not the other silently narrows the "already mapped" set, and a
# narrower set means a real ungated `base + FOO_RVA` is skipped with no output at all. A comment
# that names three files and code that opens two is not a documentation slip; it is the reviewer
# being told the union is complete when it is not.
#
# `needed-verified.tsv` stays even though it seeds the DETOUR table rather than this one: its rows

# written the two different ways, on ONE line.
#
# What "already gated" actually means is structural, not positional: the raw add is an ARGUMENT to a

# takes an absolute address and is correct as written. A resolver call merely NEAR the site says
