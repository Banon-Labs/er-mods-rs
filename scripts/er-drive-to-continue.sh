#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Drive a running Elden Ring from the title through to a loaded world, pressing Continue.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# With the `autoload` feature off, `er-quit-rows` no longer loads a character at boot, so getting
# to a world is an input problem again. AGENTS.md's standing order is that the agent drives every
# input, and the number of dialogs between the title and the menu is not fixed -- a patch notice, a
# cloud-save notice, a network warning -- so the loop presses confirm until the menu opens rather
# than assuming a count.
#
# The one dialog that must not be dismissed
# -----------------------------------------
# If the terms-of-service dialog builds, this run has no save to continue from: the game only shows
# it before the profile exists. Confirming through it would start a fresh character and quietly
# destroy the premise of whatever test asked for a Continue. So it is a hard failure, detected
# natively rather than by reading the screen -- the product logs `policy-oracle: TosTitle ctor
# 0x... built` from a detour on the dialog's own constructor (`POLICY_TOS_TITLE_CTOR_RVA`), which
# AGENTS.md requires in place of OCR.
#
# Usage
# -----
#   scripts/er-drive-to-continue.sh --arm      write the harness mode flag (before launching)
#   scripts/er-drive-to-continue.sh            watch the armed run through to an open menu
#   scripts/er-drive-to-continue.sh --to <row> ...and on to one Quit-tab row, which is one of
#                                              save-game, return-to-desktop, load-character,
#                                              load-character-from-file
#   scripts/er-drive-to-continue.sh --selftest check the log matching with no game running
#
# Requires `er_input_harness.dll` and a product shell in the running profile -- see
# ~/Elden/quit-rows-harness.me3 and scripts/er-harness-drive.sh, which this builds on.
