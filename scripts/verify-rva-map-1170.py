"""Judge whether a mapped 1.17 address is really the same function as its 1.16.2 original.

`map-rvas-1162-to-1170.py` finds where a signature RE-OCCURS. That is where the evidence stops:
the signature is short and its operands are wildcarded, so a match proves the opening bytes have
the same shape, not that the function still does the same job. This script asks the follow-up
question by decoding much further into both functions and comparing them instruction by
instruction, normalised the same way the matcher masks: mnemonic plus register operands, with
displacements, immediates and branch targets dropped.

That normalisation is the point. ELDEN RING 1.17's dominant change is layout drift -- a struct
grew, so `[rcx+0xab5]` became `[rcx+0xabd]` -- and a function whose every instruction is identical
except for such displacements is the same function. A function that has gained a branch, lost a
call, or reordered its body is not, whatever its prologue says.

A verdict is evidence for a human, not permission. `IDENTICAL` over a long body is strong;
`DIVERGES` names the first instruction index where the two disagree so the reader knows where to
look; a short body is reported as short, because 6 matching instructions is not a lot of evidence
no matter how clean the ratio looks.

VERDICTS, and the one distinction the vocabulary was missing
    The verdicts split on a question that had no word for it until 2026-08-30: was the comparison
    a PREFIX of the two bodies, or ALL of them?

    A prefix match stops for a reason that has nothing to do with where the function ends -- the
    instruction limit, a `ret` in a body that continues past it -- so it says nothing whatsoever
    about the instruction after the last one compared. `MIN_VERIFIED_INSNS` in
    `er-game-base/build.rs` exists to put a floor under that ignorance.

    An exhaustive match has no instruction after the last one. It is not a longer prefix; it is a
    different kind of claim, and it also asserts the two bodies are the same LENGTH, which no
    prefix can. Both failure modes the floor produced follow from conflating the two:

      * a LEAF of 3-11 instructions verifies at ratio 1.000 over its entire body and is thrown
        away for being shorter than 12. Five were: 0x67a810 (the GameMan save-slot setter),
        0x67a980 (er-save-suppress's quit-phase settle), 0xd4cc50 (GET_PARAM_RESCAP), 0x26634a0
        (er-input-harness's DLUID writer) and 0x4f9940 (the SpecialEffect null-container guard,
        which is why that Seamless crash fix stayed refused on 1.17);
      * `STEP_MoveMap` matched over 120 instructions of 975, scored `IDENTICAL 1.000`, cleared the
        floor easily and was promoted to detour-safe -- while the two instructions 1.17 actually
        inserted sat at index 873, and both images' `.pdata` declared extents differing by 8
        bytes, which nobody was reading.

    So: `BYTE-IDENTICAL` (whole declared body, byte for byte), `IDENTICAL-WHOLE` (whole declared
    body, normalised), `IDENTICAL-LEAF` (whole DECODED body of a function with no `.pdata` entry
    in either image) are exhaustive and take no floor. `IDENTICAL` is a prefix and keeps the
    floor. `IDENTICAL-PREFIX` is a prefix that ran out of budget and is accepted nowhere.
    `IDENTICAL-SHORT`, `NEAR`, `DIVERGES` and `UNDECODABLE` are unchanged.

    AND THE OTHER DISTINCTION THE VOCABULARY WAS MISSING, added the same day: a body that GREW,
    somewhere a detour never reaches. `PATCH-SITE-IDENTICAL` is that answer. It is not a member of
    the exhaustive family -- those assert the two streams are EQUAL and this one asserts they are
    not -- and it is not a weaker `NEAR`. It is a claim about the PATCH SITE: both images declare
    a function starting at the two addresses, the comparison covered both bodies in full, MinHook
    builds a trampoline at each and consumes the same instructions doing it, nothing branches into
    the bytes its JMP overwrites, and every instruction the two bodies disagree about lies strictly
    after the last one it relocates. `STEP_MoveMap` is why: 1.17 inserts two instructions at index
    873 of 975, its `.pdata` extent grows by 8 bytes, and the FIRST EIGHT BYTES OF ITS PROLOGUE ARE
    IDENTICAL. Refusing that detour cost the autoload gate-hold on 1.17. See `patch_site_drift`.

    AND THE MIRROR IMAGE OF THAT ONE, added the same day: a body PROVED and still un-hookable.
    `IDENTICAL-LEAF-NOPATCH` is an `IDENTICAL-LEAF` whose 3-byte body has nowhere to put a 5-byte
    jump, with MinHook's own ported rules refusing the site in both images rather than this file's
    arithmetic saying so. It is admitted to the CALL map and to nothing else. It exists because
    those were one decision until 2026-08-30: such a leaf reported `IDENTICAL-SHORT`, and
    `build.rs` seeds the CALL map from `detourable_pairs`, so a refusal about HOOKING withdrew the
    address from COMPARING too -- and `0x7add70` (`CS::MenuItem`'s constant-false accept
    predicate) and `0x1c92f30` (`CTRL_SUBOBJECT_RELEASE_RVA`) were lost to their features on that
    technicality. See `leaf_verdict`.

USAGE
    uv run --with capstone python3 scripts/verify-rva-map-1170.py            # whole table

    There is one behaviour and no flag that selects it. Leaf extents are ALWAYS derived (see the
    comment in `main`); `--leaf-extents` is accepted and ignored so an older written-down command
    still runs. It was an opt-in until 2026-08-30, which meant three correct rows of the ledger
    `er-game-base/build.rs` reads held their verdict only because somebody remembered to type it,
    and the next regeneration that forgot would have deleted them at exit 0.

`--tsv` TRUNCATES ITS TARGET. It writes what THIS run verified and nothing else, so pointing it
at `docs/recon/rva-map-1162-to-1170.verified.tsv` -- the ledger hand-derived pairs are put in
because nothing regenerates it -- is a rewrite, not an update: 65 of that file's 99 addresses do
not come from the default candidate map and would not come back. `preserve_unverified` now
carries such rows forward verbatim under a `# CARRIED FORWARD` banner and names every one on
stderr, and refuses the write outright if a row's pair disagrees with this run's. A row still
leaves the file the moment a human deletes its line; nothing here restores it.

# the detour map. Every other unhappy verdict merely fails to ADD a row; this one REMOVES one that

#
# That asymmetry is why it is a named constant rather than a string typed at each use. A missing

# WHY THIS IS NOT "RE-CHECK THE PROLOGUE AND SHIP IT". A prologue re-check is what the impostor at

#
# WHAT IT CLAIMS: everything IDENTICAL-LEAF claims, minus the hook. Both extents were DECODED
# because neither image declares a `.pdata` entry, the two decodes arrived at the same byte
# length, the normalised streams are equal over all of both bodies, and no branch inside either
# body targets the bytes a patch would overwrite. What it adds is the refusal, in MinHook's own

#
# WHY THE REFUSAL HAD TO BECOME A VERDICT RATHER THAN STAY A FALLBACK. Before 2026-08-30 such a
# leaf fell back to `IDENTICAL`/`IDENTICAL-SHORT`, and `leaf_fits_patch` described that as keeping
# the row CALLABLE and refusing only the detour. It did not: `build.rs` seeds the CALL map from
# `detourable_pairs(VERIFIED_MAP)`, so the two decisions were one, and `IDENTICAL-SHORT` withdrew
# the address from COMPARING as well as from hooking. Two rows were losing a feature that way:
#
#   * `0x7add70 -> 0x7aebf0`, `CS::MenuItem`'s constant-false accept predicate (`33 c0 c3`,
#     `xor eax,eax; ret`). er-quickload only ever compares a row's `+0xf8` against it;
#   * `0x1c92f30 -> 0x1c94d30`, `CTRL_SUBOBJECT_RELEASE_RVA` (`c2 00 00`, `ret 0`), which
#     er-invasion-path CALLS while tearing an effect down -- and its `let ... else { return }`
#     abandons the whole teardown when the address will not resolve.
#
# Both are 3-byte bodies. A 3-byte function is a perfectly good thing to call and to compare
# against; it is nowhere to put a 5-byte jump. The two claims are now separate.

    the feature behind it dies quietly, which is the exact outcome this migration exists to
    prevent.

    THE FIRST `ret` IS NOT THE END. Stopping there -- the obvious rule, and the one tried first --
    gets several of these wrong, because a getter with a range check is `cmp / ja / <compute> / ret
    / xor eax,eax / ret`: the early `ret` is the fast path and the branch target sits BEHIND it.
    Measured against the 1.16.2 Ghidra dump's own function sizes, first-`ret` truncates
    `0x140261b80` to 0x17 of its 0x1a bytes and `0x140262250` to 0x10 of its 0x13. So the sweep
    carries a watermark of the furthest forward branch target seen, and only a `ret`/tail-`jmp`
    that ends beyond every such target ends the function.

    The extent never includes the padding that follows, which is what keeps two builds with
    different pad runs in phase. Returns `None` when no terminator is reached inside `limit`.

    A TAIL CALL OUT OF THE FUNCTION ENDS IT, WHATEVER FOLLOWS. The `jmp` clause below used to
    require that the fall-through byte be padding or a declared function start, and in the
    de-Arxan'd images that test cannot fire at all across large stretches of `.text`: the gaps
    between functions there hold the deobfuscator's LEFTOVER BYTES rather than `cc`/`90` runs, and
    a `.pdata`-less region has no declared start to land on either. Measured at the three addresses
    that sent this back for repair on 2026-08-30 -- the gap before 1.16.2 `0x14090a0a0` is
    `82 cd ac aa 32 3e 47 4b`, and before 1.17 `0x14090b240` it is `05 00 00 00 00 00 00 00`.
    Neither is padding, so the sweep walked straight through the gap and kept going:

    * `0x14090a0a0 -> 0x14090b240` (`LOADING_SCREEN_GFX_FADEOUT_RVA`) decoded `LEAF:0x45/0x45` --
      the 23-byte thunk, 9 bytes of gap, the WHOLE NEXT thunk, 9 more bytes of gap and into a
      third function -- and then reported `DIVERGES 0.86`, because the two images' gap bytes
      differ. Ghidra puts both functions at 23 bytes, in both builds.
    * `0x14090a0c0 -> 0x14090b260` (`KNOWLEDGE_TIP_ADVANCE_ENABLED_RVA`) decoded `LEAF:0x25/0x25`
      and reported `DIVERGES 0.75`. Ghidra: 23 bytes, both builds.

    That is the WORST available failure. `refuted_sources` in `er-game-base/build.rs` reads
    `DIVERGES` as positive evidence the pair is WRONG and subtracts the address from the CALL map
    as well as the detour map, so a sweep artefact would not merely fail to rescue these rows, it
    would delete them -- and delete a correct address on the strength of comparing one image's
    dead gap bytes against another's.

    So a direct `jmp` whose target lies OUTSIDE the sweep window ends the body on its own. Such a
    jump leaves the function by construction; nothing inside can branch back over it (the
    watermark already refuses the stop if anything did), and the bytes after it are unreachable by
    fall-through whether they are padding, leftovers or the next function. The narrowness is
    deliberate and is what separates this from "any `jmp` ends the body": an intra-function jump --
    around a block, forward to the epilogue -- targets an address inside the window and still has
    to satisfy the original padding/start test. Indirect jumps have no immediate at all, so
    `branch_target` returns `None` and a jump table is untouched by this clause.

    The fourth element is what turns an instruction INDEX back into a BYTE OFFSET, which is the
    only way to ask whether a difference at instruction 873 lies inside or outside the handful of
    bytes MinHook is going to relocate. `PATCH_SITE_IDENTICAL` needs exactly that question
    answered; nothing else uses it, and `decode` still returns the stream alone.

    The stop reason is the half that was missing until 2026-08-30, and its absence is what let a
    truncated comparison pass itself off as a complete one. `compare` had no way to ask "did this
    decode reach the end of the function, or did it merely run out of budget", so it inferred
    coverage from the extent's BYTE LENGTH -- which answers a different question. Measured
    consequence: `STEP_MoveMap` (0x140af7cf0 -> 0x140af9000) is 975 instructions and 1.17 inserts
    two of them at instruction 873; the first 120 matched, the row read `IDENTICAL 1.000`, and it
    was promoted into `DETOUR_SAFE_1162_TO_1170` on evidence covering 12% of the body.

    Reasons, in the order they can occur:
      * `STOP_EXTENT` -- the decode reached the declared end. The comparison is complete.
      * `STOP_TERMINATOR` -- an unbounded decode ended on a `ret` or a tail `jmp` at a boundary.
        Complete as far as this file can tell, but nothing declared where the end was.
      * `STOP_LIMIT` -- the decode ran out of `DECODE_LIMIT` or `DECODE_BYTES`. The result is a
        PREFIX of unknown coverage, and `compare` refuses to call a prefix identical.

    KNOWING WHERE TO STOP IS THE WHOLE ACCURACY OF THIS TOOL. Stopping only at `ret` -- which is
    what this did until 2026-08-30 -- silently walks off the end of any function that ends in a
    TAIL CALL, and a great many do. Past the end sits inter-function padding whose length differs
    between builds (measured: 3 bytes in 1.16.2 against 4 in 1.17 after
    `CS::MenuWindowJob::~MenuWindowJob`), so the two decodes fall out of phase and every
    instruction after that point compares unequal. The result is a confident `DIVERGES` on a
    function that is byte-identical in its own body.

    That false negative is not merely noise: `build.rs::refuted_sources()` treats `DIVERGES` as
    positive evidence that an address is WRONG and subtracts the row from `VERIFIED_1162_TO_1170`
    -- the CALL map, not just the detour map. So a decoding artifact removes a working address and
    the feature dies with a `failed to resolve` line. Three independent reviews on 2026-08-30
    found the same artifact behind 12 of 12 non-clean rows, with zero changed immediates and zero
    changed struct offsets among them.

    Stops, in order of authority:
      1. `end_rva` -- the `.pdata` extent. The image's own declaration of where the function ends;
         nothing beats it, so it is used whenever both images declare one.
      2. `ret`.
      3. An unconditional `jmp` immediately followed by a pad byte -- `int3` (0xCC) or `nop`
         (0x90); see `FUNCTION_PAD_BYTES`, and note the two builds do not always pad the same
         function the same way. A `jmp` in the middle of a body (a loop, a branch to a shared
         epilogue) is followed by real code and must NOT stop the decode.
      4. An unconditional `jmp` with a rel8/rel32 destination, past the FORWARD-BRANCH WATERMARK.
         For the shape rules 1-3 all miss: a 5-byte `jmp` THUNK. It has no `.pdata` entry in
         either image (so rule 1 never fires), no `ret` (rule 2), and the game's thunks are packed
         flush against each other, so the byte after the `jmp` is the next thunk's first
         instruction rather than padding (rule 3). Measured on `UPDATE_TROPHY_STATS_RVA`
         0x24a1a0, which is `e9 1b 14 00 00` at the SAME address in both images and was
         nonetheless reported `DIVERGES 0.05, first diff at insn 1` -- insn 1 being the first
         instruction of the NEXT thunk, a different one in each build.

         HOW RULE 4 TELLS A TAIL CALL FROM A MID-BODY `jmp`. It carries a watermark: the furthest
         forward destination of any branch decoded so far, this `jmp` included. The rule fires
         only when the byte after the `jmp` is beyond that watermark, and the three cases
         separate cleanly:
           * a `jmp` to a SHARED EPILOGUE branches forward, so its own destination raises the
             watermark past the following byte and the rule does not fire;
           * a LOOP back-edge branches backward -- but then whatever follows it can only be
             entered by an earlier forward branch, whose destination already raised the watermark
             past the following byte, so the rule does not fire there either. Control does not
             fall through an unconditional `jmp`, so a following instruction that NO decoded
             branch reaches is not part of this function;
           * a TAIL CALL or thunk leaves the function, nothing decoded so far reaches the
             following byte, and the decode stops exactly at the end.
         Indirect `jmp`s are excluded by `branch_target` returning `None` for them, which is what
         stops a switch dispatch from truncating its own cases.

    WHEN AN EXTENT IS DECLARED IT IS THE ONLY STOP THAT APPLIES, and `DECODE_LIMIT` /
    `DECODE_BYTES` / `ret` are all suspended for it. Both of the suspended rules were producing
    silently partial comparisons that the caller could not distinguish from complete ones:

      * `ret` truncates any function with an early-return fast path. Measured on
        `MMS_STEP_FINISH` (0x140aec050), where the first `ret` ends the decode at 35 of the
        function's 46 instructions even though the `.pdata` extent runs on;
      * the limit truncates every long body. Measured across the two verdict tables: 150 of 383
        rows never reached their own declared end, `STEP_MoveMap` at 120 of 975.

    The limits exist to bound a decode that has NO declared end -- there they are the only thing
    standing between this tool and the rest of the image -- and they keep applying in that case.

    THE ASYMMETRY THIS ENCODES. A verdict that fails to ACCEPT a row costs a feature loudly: the
    address stays unmapped and the DLL logs `failed to resolve`. [`REFUTED`] is the only verdict
    that goes the other way -- `build.rs::refuted_sources()` subtracts the row from the CALL map as
    well as the detour map, so a correct address that was already working disappears, with nothing
    printed. Deleting a right answer is strictly worse than declining to add one, so the evidence
    required for it has to be correspondingly stronger.

    A DECODED extent is not that evidence. `.pdata` is the image's own statement about where a
    function ends; `leaf_extent` is this file's CONCLUSION about it, reached by a sweep whose stop
    rules have been wrong before. MEASURED, and the reason this exists: until 2026-08-30 the sweep
    ended a body at a `jmp` only when the following byte was `0xCC`/`0x90` padding or a declared
    `.pdata` start. In these de-Arxan'd images the inter-function gaps hold the deobfuscator's
    residue instead -- `48 8d 64 24 08 ff 64 24 f8` after 1.16.2 `0x14090a0b7` -- so the sweep ran
    through the gap into the NEXT function and compared unrelated code. `0x14090a0a0 ->
    0x14090b240` took extents of 0x45/0x45 instead of 0x17/0x17 and came back `DIVERGES 0.86`; a
    23-byte thunk that is the same function in both builds would have been SUBTRACTED from the call
    map on the strength of comparing one image's dead gap bytes against another's.

    The stop rule is fixed. This is the rule that makes the next such bug cost a dropped row rather
    than a deleted one: the pair is re-judged with the decoded extent withdrawn, which is the
    answer the file would have given had it never guessed at a boundary. That answer is a prefix
    comparison, so it can only reach `IDENTICAL`/`IDENTICAL-SHORT`/`NEAR` -- verdicts nothing
    accepts and nothing subtracts -- unless the UNDECODED comparison refutes the pair on its own
    terms, in which case the refutation is kept, because then it never rested on the guess.

    Returns the re-judged result, carrying `refutation_withheld` when the withdrawal actually
    changed the answer, so `main` can say out loud that a refutation was declined. A rule that
    quietly suppressed one would be its own silent failure.

    decode bounded by the extent legitimately ends short. Two rows do exactly this:

    to be held to it too -- otherwise the one verdict that issues its own detour licence issues a
    licence to write five bytes into a three-byte body, and past its end into whatever follows.

    MEASURED 2026-08-30, on the regeneration that first admitted leaves: two 3-byte bodies reached
    `DETOUR_SAFE_1162_TO_1170` this way. `0x1407add70 -> 0x1407aebf0` (`LEAF:0x3/0x3`, body

    PATCH-UNSAFE with the reason spelled out -- 3 bytes long, the bytes after are not padding and
    the five above are not padding either, so there is nowhere to put the jump. Neither would have

    `build.rs` admits to the CALL map and to nothing else. It is not a fallback to
    `IDENTICAL`/`IDENTICAL-SHORT`: that is what this docstring used to claim, and it was false.
    `build.rs` seeded the CALL map from `detourable_pairs`, so `IDENTICAL-SHORT` withdrew a
    three-byte getter from COMPARING as well as from hooking, and both addresses above were lost
    to their features entirely. Only when MinHook's own ported rules also refuse the site, so the

    byte length, and the normalised streams are equal over all of both bodies. What is left is the
    HOOK, and the two clauses below decide it. Each is named, each is checked independently, and
    each has been observed to fail on its own in `leaf_nopatch_selftest`.

      1. PROLOGUE -- no branch inside either body targets the bytes a patch overwrites
         (`branch_into_prologue`, both images). This is the claim a `.pdata` entry stands in for
         and a leaf cannot make; without it a leaf reaches `DETOURABLE_ENTRY_EVIDENCE` through
         `NEITHER-ENTRY`, a clause written for a different situation entirely.
      2. ROOM -- the body is at least the five bytes MinHook writes (`leaf_fits_patch`, both
         images; equal extents mean both sides answer alike), AND, when it is not, MinHook's own
         ported rules confirm they will not install there (`minhook_refusal`, both images).

    THREE OUTCOMES, and the middle one is why this function exists:

      * both clauses hold -> [`IDENTICAL_LEAF`], which carries its own detour licence;
      * PROLOGUE holds, ROOM does not, and MinHook refuses BOTH sites for itself ->
        [`IDENTICAL_LEAF_NOPATCH`]: the identity is proved and the hook is refused, and those are
        now two answers instead of one. `build.rs` admits it to the CALL map only;
      * anything else -> `IDENTICAL`/`IDENTICAL-SHORT`, accepted nowhere. A leaf whose prologue is
        a branch target gets no verdict of its own: the refusal is not about room, so naming it
        NOPATCH would misdescribe it, and a body that can be branched into is a shape nobody has
        examined rather than one that has been cleared for calling.

    WHY MINHOOK IS ASKED AT ALL when clause 2's first half already answered. Because the two can
    disagree, in the direction that matters: MinHook will hook a sub-five-byte function when
    uniform padding follows it or precedes the entry, so "shorter than five bytes" is this file's
    arithmetic and not a refusal. Requiring the real refusal keeps the verdict's name true, and
    keeps a row whose site MinHook would actually accept out of a verdict that says it would not.

    `bytes` is MinHook's `oldPos` when its trampoline walk finishes -- the run of original bytes
    copied into the trampoline, and so also the offset its trailing jump returns INTO. `insns` is
    how many of THIS decode's instructions that run covers, which is the unit the diff below is
    measured in. The two are not interchangeable: a displacement that widened from disp8 to disp32
    changes the byte count of an instruction without changing the instruction, and the instruction
    count is the claim worth making.

    The refusal is `patch_safe`'s, unabridged, and covers both halves: MinHook declining to build
    a trampoline at all, and a branch elsewhere in the body landing on the four operand bytes of
    the JMP that is about to replace the prologue.

    WHY `relocated` AND NOT SIMPLY `PATCH_BYTES`, given they usually agree. MinHook's walk stops
    at the FIRST instruction boundary at or past five bytes, so every instruction it consumed
    starts below five and the two expressions return the same COUNT for any function at least five
    bytes long -- measured: zero of ~25,000 sampled 1.16.2 `.pdata` functions distinguish them, and
    a mutation swapping one for the other is therefore invisible to the selftest. They part company
    for a function SHORTER than the patch, where MinHook falls back to a two-byte hop and
    `relocated` is the honest smaller number while `PATCH_BYTES` would claim instructions past the
    end of the body.

    THE CLAIM, IN THE ORDER IT IS CHECKED. Every clause is about the detour; none of them is
    about how much of the body happens to agree.

      1. MinHook will build a trampoline at BOTH addresses, and nothing in either body branches
         into the bytes its JMP overwrites (`relocated_prefix` -> `patch_safe`). A pair that fails
         here has no detour to license, whatever its bodies look like.
      2. It relocates the SAME NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONS at both. A different number means the two
         walks consumed different code, which is a changed patch site by definition -- and it is
         checked in instructions rather than bytes so that a widened displacement, which 1.17 is
         full of, is not mistaken for one.
      3. The two normalised streams are aligned with `difflib`, and the FIRST place they disagree
         is strictly after the last relocated instruction, in BOTH streams. Instruction `r` -- the
         one the trampoline returns into -- therefore sits inside the equal prefix, so the bytes
         the patch overwrites and the instruction control comes back to are the same in both
         builds. This is the clause the whole verdict is named for, and it is checked before the
         two below so that a refusal names the patch site when the patch site is what moved.
      4. No `replace` hunk. Displacement and immediate drift is already normalised away, so a
         surviving replace is a real change of opcode or register at an aligned position -- a
         different instruction doing a different thing. Measured across the whole image: 173 of
         the 199 differing pairs carry one, and refusing them is what keeps this verdict about
         insertions rather than about rewrites.
      5. The difference stays inside `MAX_DRIFT_HUNKS` places and `MAX_DRIFT_INSNS` instructions.

    WHAT IT CANNOT LICENSE, and why. A MOVED patch site fails clause 1, 2 or 3: the entry region
    is compared instruction for instruction against 1.16.2's, and any insertion, deletion or
    substitution inside it -- or before it -- puts the first hunk at or below `r` and the verdict
    is refused however small the total diff. A pair landing mid-function never reaches this
    function at all: `compare` requires `BOTH-ENTRIES` from each image's own `.pdata` before
    calling it, and a mid-function address is a start in neither image.

    ON `0x140aec480`, and what this verdict does NOT claim about it. That address -- `IDENTICAL
    1.000` over 56 instructions, `+0x360` inside `0x140aec120..0x140aec567` -- fails the
    `BOTH-ENTRIES` requirement, so it cannot reach here; but it would not have reached here
    anyway, because its two streams are EQUAL and this verdict is only ever asked about bodies
    that DIFFER. What actually stopped it was deleting its ledger row. Do not read
    PATCH-SITE-IDENTICAL as the thing that catches an impostor; read it as a claim that does not
    widen the gate for one.

    And a body that changed near the entry is refused even when the change is a single
    instruction, because clause 3 is a position test, not a size test.

    BECAUSE nothing regenerates it -- as of 2026-08-30, 65 of its 99 addresses are not in
    `rva-map-1162-to-1170.tsv` and would not come back. `verify-rva-map-1170.py --tsv
    docs/recon/rva-map-1162-to-1170.verified.tsv` reads like a refresh and is a deletion of
    two thirds of the file, at exit 0, with no line of output naming what went.

    So: a pair the target holds and this run did not produce is CARRIED FORWARD verbatim (its
    verdict columns were produced by this same verifier on an earlier, narrower run, so the line
    is still true) and listed on stderr. A pair the target maps somewhere ELSE than this run does
    is a CONFLICT -- one of the two is a wrong address at a live-looking value -- and the caller
    refuses to write rather than pick.

    COMMENT LINES ARE CARRIED TOO, and were NOT until 2026-09-01. That omission was the same
    silent loss this function exists to prevent, wearing different clothing: the guard counted
    ROWS, so `docs/recon/rva-map-1162-to-1170.verified.tsv` came through a narrow run with all
    103 data rows intact and 181 of its 209 comment lines gone, at exit 0, with nothing on
    stderr naming them. Measured on the 2026-09-01 ProfileSelect run: 312 lines in, 174 out.

    What went is not decoration. Those interleaved blocks are where this ledger records the
    reasoning a row cannot hold -- why 0x140aec480 was REMOVED (mid-function, +0x360 inside
    0xaec120, and mapping it relocated the bug rather than fixing it), why 0xcf9300 is
    deliberately ABSENT, that ersc.dll RVAs are STRUCK because 1.17 cannot move them, and the
    four mid-function addresses whose rows were refused precisely BECAUSE they verify
    IDENTICAL. Delete those and the next agent re-adds the row that was removed on purpose,
    with the verifier agreeing beautifully about the wrong thing.

    The LEADING comment block is the exception: everything before the first data line is the
    header this writer regenerates (see `role_note`), so carrying it would duplicate it. From
    the first data row onward every line is kept in its original order -- comments, blanks and
    unreproduced rows alike -- so a block stays attached to the rows it annotates. A row this
    run DOES reproduce moves up into the fresh section while its comment stays put; that
    separates a note from its row, which is a readability cost and not a loss, and it is the
    price of never deleting one.

    on 2026-08-30 alone, all of them by filtering to an empty set and then finding nothing wrong
    with it. So there are three layers, and the third is the one that matters:

      1. `PATCH_SITE_CASES`: real pairs from the two images, two accepted and five refused, each
         refusal landing on a named clause.
      2. the refusal REASON is asserted, not just the boolean. A pair refused for the wrong reason
         is a gate that happens to agree with the answer.
      3. MUTATION. Each clause is broken in turn -- the position test, the drift ceiling, the hunk
         ceiling, the entry requirement, MinHook's own walk -- and `STEP_MoveMap`, which passes
         all of them, must FLIP to a refusal, then flip back when the mutation is undone. A clause

    """Pin the decode boundary, and record that one 2026-08-29 verdict was retracted.

    THE RETRACTION, because a test that asserts a wrong answer is worse than no test. This
    selftest used to require `HUD_WEAPON_SLOT_UPDATE` (0x1408d2110 -> 0x1408d32b0) to come back
    `DIVERGES` at "18% of its instruction shape", and treated that as the lesson of the
    2026-08-29 crash bisect. The 18% was an artifact of THIS FILE: the function is 86 bytes and
    ends in a tail-call `jmp`, `decode()` stopped only at `ret`, and roughly 98 of the 120
    instructions it compared belonged to the NEXT function. Bounded by the `.pdata` extent the two
    bodies differ in four bytes, both of them halves of `call rel32` displacements, and the
    verdict is IDENTICAL. Three independent reviews found the same artifact behind 12 of 12
    non-clean rows, with zero changed immediates and zero changed struct offsets among them.

    WHAT IS NOT RETRACTED: the crash was real. Its cause is now UNKNOWN and must be re-derived --
    an independent look at the same run found the game dying in FromSoftware's own `DL_PANIC`
    ("未初期化のシングルトンにアクセスしました", FD4Singleton.h) for an uninitialised singleton,
    which points at a stale `.data` global rather than at a detour. Do not read the IDENTICAL
    verdict below as "that address was fine all along"; read it as "the reason we gave was wrong".

    So what is asserted here is the BOUNDARY, which is the thing that was actually broken: a
    function ending in a tail call must compare over its own body and no further.

    #     for these functions in BOTH dumps. It is written here rather than recomputed from
    #     `leaf_extent`, because a number the code under test produced cannot check that code.
