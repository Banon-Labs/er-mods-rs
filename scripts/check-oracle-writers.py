"""Fail the build when a telemetry counter is READ but never WRITTEN.

WHY THIS GATE EXISTS. A counter in `er-telemetry` that is defined, re-exported and read once to
emit an oracle -- but never written -- reports 0/false forever. Nothing downstream can tell that
apart from "the feature ran and did nothing", so the oracle does not merely fail to inform, it
actively misinforms. That is not hypothetical: on 2026-07-31 an agent cited
`oracle_title_overlay_cover_render_calls=0` as proof the title cover painted no pixels during a
loading-screen gap and mis-framed a defect around it. Six counters behind that family had no
writers at all; a further 13 with the same shape were found by audit (er-effects-rs-56fx).

A `bd` note cannot prevent the next one. This can.

WHAT COUNTS AS A WRITE. Any of `.store` `.fetch_add` `.fetch_sub` `.fetch_max` `.fetch_min`
`.fetch_or` `.fetch_and` `.fetch_xor` `.fetch_nand` `.fetch_update` `.swap`
`.compare_exchange[_weak]`, matched across newlines because
rustfmt wraps them (`NAME\n    .fetch_add(1, ...)`), and optionally through an index (`NAME[i]`)
for counter arrays.

CRUCIALLY, also `&NAME`: hook-original trampolines are handed to the MinHook installer by
reference (`MhHook::new(addr, detour, &TITLE_UPDATE_ORIG)`) and written through that pointer. A
naive scan flags all ~20 `*_ORIG` statics as dead. They are not. Omitting this rule was the
difference between a first audit reporting 86 dead counters and the true figure of 13.

That by-reference rule accepts a PATH QUALIFIER (`&crate::map_confirm::ORIG_WARP_JOB_ASSEMBLER`),
because the installer and the trampoline do not have to live in the same module. Requiring a bare
name made this gate punish exactly the refactor it should be neutral about: moving a hook into its
own file turned a written static into a reported offender without changing one line of behaviour,
which teaches the reader to distrust the gate rather than the code.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/check-oracle-writers.py            # scan the repo, exit 1 on any offender
  python3 scripts/check-oracle-writers.py --selftest # run the built-in regression cases
