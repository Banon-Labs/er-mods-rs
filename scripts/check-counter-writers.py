"""Fail the build when a telemetry counter is DECLARED but never WRITTEN anywhere.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY `check-oracle-writers.py` DID NOT ALREADY COVER IT.

`scripts/check-oracle-writers.py` fires only when `writes == 0 and reads > 0` -- a counter that is
read to emit an oracle but never written. Its own selftest pins the exclusion:

    if "NEVER_TOUCHED" in got: failures.append("NEVER_TOUCHED was flagged; unread counters are
                                                out of scope")

So a counter that is declared and never written and never `.load()`ed is DELIBERATELY invisible to
it. That is most of the debt. On 2026-08-31 a census found 151 of the 1,412 statics declared in
`crates/er-telemetry-core/src/counters.rs` with no write site anywhere in the tree, and only 14 of
them were on the oracle-writers allowlist -- the other 137 had never been looked at, because
nothing looked.

An unwritten counter is not inert. Three ways it does damage:
  * it gets `.load()`ed later by someone who assumes a declared counter is a live counter, and the
    permanent 0 reads as "the feature ran and did nothing" (`PROFILE_DISPLAY_FRAMES_WINDOW` was
    scored against exactly that way on this branch);
  * it is already printed into a log line (`draws=`, `defer_*=`) where a human reads the 0 as a
    measurement;
  * it is `pub` and re-exported, so it looks like part of the telemetry contract.

WHAT COUNTS AS A WRITE is deliberately the same rule set as `check-oracle-writers.py`, so the two
gates cannot disagree about a given counter: any atomic RMW/store, optionally through an index,
matched across rustfmt line breaks; plus `&NAME` / `&crate::path::NAME` / `&raw const NAME`,
because MinHook trampolines are written through a reference handed to the installer.

TWO EXTRA RULES THIS GATE NEEDS AND THE ORACLE GATE DOES NOT.

  1. MACRO-CONSTRUCTED NAMES. A write site can name a counter through `paste!`/`concat_idents!` or
     a `macro_rules!` `$name` substitution, in which case the literal identifier never appears at
     the write. Deleting such a counter on the strength of a name search is the failure mode this
     script must not cause, so a file that writes an atomic through a CONSTRUCTED identifier makes
     the whole census undecidable and the gate REFUSES (exit 2) naming that file. No file in the
     tree trips it today. `--selftest` carries the frozen negative for it, and the opposite blind:
     a benign `$x:ident` macro must NOT make the gate refuse.

  2. NON-`.rs` WRITE SITES. Counters can be written from generated code emitted by a `build.rs`
     into `OUT_DIR`. Those files are scanned when present.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/check-counter-writers.py            # scan; exit 1 on any un-allowlisted offender
  python3 scripts/check-counter-writers.py --list     # print every declared-but-unwritten name
  python3 scripts/check-counter-writers.py --json P   # dump the full census to P
  python3 scripts/check-counter-writers.py --selftest # built-in regression cases

# construction sitting beside an atomic write -- then the literal counter name never appears at the
# write site and searching for it proves nothing. Deleting a counter on that evidence is the one
# outcome this gate must never cause, so such a file makes the census UNDECIDABLE and the gate
# REFUSES (exit 2) naming the file, rather than reporting its counters as dead.
#
# It is deliberately narrow. A `$x:ident` parameter on its own is not enough (half the tree's
# helper macros take one), and neither is a `paste!` in a file that performs no atomic write at
# all. As of 2026-08-31 NO file in the tree trips this, so the gate is decidable everywhere; the
# refusal exists so that the day one appears, the answer is "I cannot tell" and not a deletion.
