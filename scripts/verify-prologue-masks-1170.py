"""Check the generated prologue MASKS, and re-run the 51 prologue gates under masked comparison.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
Every detour in this workspace byte-checks its target's prologue before installing. Three of
those pins open with `mov rax, [rip+disp32]`, and a rip-relative displacement is the delta from
the end of the instruction to the global it names -- both ends move when the game is patched, so
those four bytes are GUARANTEED to re-encode. Measured on ELDEN RING 1.17:
`SAVE_REQUEST_RETRACT_B72_SIG`, `..._B73_SIG` and `QUIT_PHASE_SETTLE_SIG` are the same
instructions doing the same job at correctly translated addresses, and all three gates disarmed
on nothing but that field. The features were silently off.

`build-support/prologue_build.rs` now emits, beside every generated pin, a `<NAME>_MASK` in which
0xff = compare and 0x00 = ignore, and only a RIP-relative displacement ever gets 0x00. This
script is the offline gate on that:

  masks      Every emitted `<NAME>_MASK` is re-derived INDEPENDENTLY, with capstone, through
             `scripts/map-rvas-1162-to-1170.py`'s `build_masked_pattern(..., rip_only=True)` --
             the same function the address mapper uses, narrowed to the subset a GATE can
             justify -- and must agree byte for byte with what `iced-x86` emitted in the build
             script. Two decoders, one rule; a disagreement is a defect in one of them.
  prologues  The 51 pins re-checked at their 1.17 addresses under the MASKED comparison, so the
             verdict is the one the running DLL would reach rather than a plain `==`.
  negative   The fail-closed proof: take a real masked pin, mutate an OPCODE byte, and require
             the masked comparison to still reject it. Also proves `+0xb72` and `+0xb73` still
             refuse each other, since a mask that swallowed the register-base displacement would
             let each accept the other function.

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE
----------------------
A pin that ARMS proves the pin ACCEPTS the bytes at that address. It does not prove the hook
installs, that the function still does the same job, or that the feature works. Nothing here
runs against a live game.

USAGE
    python3 scripts/verify-prologue-masks-1170.py                # all three sections
    python3 scripts/verify-prologue-masks-1170.py --selftest     # no images, no build needed
    python3 scripts/verify-prologue-masks-1170.py --section masks
    python3 scripts/verify-prologue-masks-1170.py --require-images
    python3 scripts/verify-prologue-masks-1170.py --require-generated

Exit 0 = every emitted mask matches the independent derivation, every negative control still
rejects, and no pin regressed. Exit non-zero = a count of problems, each printed.

capstone is not installed system-wide on purpose; the script re-execs itself under
`uv run --with capstone` when the import fails, exactly as `dump-deobf-shift.py` does.
