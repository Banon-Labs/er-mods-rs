"""What would the generated 1.16.2 -> 1.17 address map contain if a ledger row changed?

`crates/er-game-base/build.rs` turns four TSV ledgers into two tables -- `VERIFIED_1162_TO_1170`
(may be CALLed or READ) and `DETOUR_SAFE_1162_TO_1170` (may additionally be hooked). The rules it
applies are not obvious: most verdicts that fall short of a detour are dropped from BOTH tables
rather than merely denied one, `CALLABLE_ONLY_VERDICTS` is the single exception that reaches the
CALL map alone, and one `DIVERGES` row is subtracted from both tables ACROSS ledgers.

So "what does this ledger edit actually do" cannot be answered by reading the diff, and answering
it by rebuilding means a cross-compile per scenario -- and mutating a tracked ledger to measure.
This re-implements `emit_address_map` and counts, which makes a verdict-policy decision measurable
before it is taken.

IT IS NOT TRUSTED ON ITS OWN SAY-SO. `--against <address_map_1170.rs>` compares the simulation to
a table cargo really generated and fails on any difference, so a drift in build.rs's rules shows
up as a red comparison rather than as a confident wrong number.
