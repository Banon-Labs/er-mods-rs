"""Fail when the installed Seamless Co-op is not the ONE build this workspace supports.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
On 2026-09-02 Seamless Co-op v2.0.0 replaced v1.9.9 under an unchanged file name,
and every `ersc.dll` fact this repo holds went stale in one move: `show` left
`0x180022d30`, the session object's state field went from `S+0x110` to `S+0x150`,
and the session-state enum was renumbered by `+1` throughout.  None of that
announces itself.  A DLL built against v1.9.9 loads into v2.0.0 without complaint;
its gates refuse, the feature silently does nothing, and the player has no way to
know the mod and their Seamless are describing different programs.

So this workspace supports exactly one Seamless build at a time, and the question
asked here is the only one worth asking: *is the installed module that build, yes
or no*.  There is no candidate list and no adaptation.  A set of addresses from one
build used with the field offsets of another does not fail loudly -- it reads and
writes the wrong members of a live multiplayer session.

Both halves of the comparison are readable off the disk, so this never needs a game
to run.  The supported version is `ERSC_SUPPORTED_VERSION` in
`build-support/prologue_build.rs`, parsed rather than copied -- the point is to
read what the build scripts actually enforce.  The installed version is the
`Seamless Co-op vX.Y.Z by Yui` banner Seamless builds into its own image, read
rather than inferred from a path, a size or a timestamp, none of which change when
the build does.

WHAT IT REFUSES TO GUESS
------------------------
If it cannot find the module, or cannot find the constant, or cannot parse either,
it says which one and exits 0 -- a missing Seamless is not a failed gate, it is a
machine without Seamless.  It exits non-zero only for the case it exists to catch:
both sides present, readable, and disagreeing.  That is the same line
`check-game-version-supported.py` draws, for the same reason.

RELATIONSHIP TO THE BUILD SCRIPT
--------------------------------
`build-support/prologue_build.rs` performs the same identity check, but on the file
it is about to ground-truth constants against -- which `ER_ERSC_DLL` may redirect to
an archived copy of the supported build so a developer can still compile.  This gate
answers the other question: what will the machine actually LOAD.  It honours
`ERSC_DLL`/`ER_GAME_DIR` (there is no single hard-coded user path in this repo) but
NOT `ER_ERSC_DLL`, so the build-side escape hatch cannot wave a real mismatch past
the validation suite.
