"""Fail when an address that a RESOLVER produced is handed to a hook API that RESOLVES AGAIN.

WHAT THIS GATE FORBIDS, IN ONE LINE
-----------------------------------
A value passed to a resolving hook API must not itself be the output of a resolver.

WHY -- THE FAILURE IS SILENT AND IT LANDS ON A THIRD FUNCTION
-------------------------------------------------------------
`er_hook::MhHook::new` and `er_hook::register_union_hook` resolve 1.16.2 -> 1.17 INTERNALLY, via
`resolve_target`. A caller that calls `er_game_base::mem::game_rva(RVA)` first and hands them the
RESULT therefore resolves twice.

Normally the second resolve is a no-op: the address is a 1.17 destination, `already_translated_in`
recognises it and hands it back. That is exactly why this survived for so long. But an address can
be BOTH a 1.17 destination of one row and the 1.16.2 SOURCE of a different row -- which happens
whenever the region shift equals the local inter-function spacing, so `B - A == C - B`. On such an
address translation wins over the shortcut (it must; see `already_translated_in`), and the second
resolve silently returns C. No error, no refusal, no log line, and the feature's own log still
prints the address it MEANT.

MEASURED, 2026-08-30 18:42 run, three real detours installed on the wrong function:

    game_rva @ own_load/drive.rs:373        0x140614870 -> 0x1406156c0
    MhHook::new 0x1406156c0                 0x1406156c0 -> 0x140616510   <-- detour landed here
    game_rva @ trace/menu_trace_hooks.rs:274 0x1407ac890 -> 0x1407ad710
    register_union_hook 0x1407ad710          0x1407ad710 -> 0x1407ae590   <-- and here
    game_rva @ lookat_stage_camera.rs:575   0x140bba6e0 -> 0x140bbbd90
    MhHook::new 0x140bbbd90                  0x140bbbd90 -> 0x140bbd440   <-- and here

`0x140bbd440` is a `CSMenuFaceModelRend` method; `0x1407ae590` is a hot Scaleform function with 16
callers. Byte controls comparing 1.16.2@X against 1.17@X score 5/92, 0/46 and 7/72 -- genuinely
unrelated code.

The fix at every site is the same and it is structural: pass the UNRESOLVED `base + RVA` and let the
hook API own the single resolve.

WHY THE API LIST IS DERIVED AND NOT TRANSCRIBED
-----------------------------------------------
A transcribed list goes stale the moment someone adds a fourth entry point, and a gate that silently
stops covering a function is worse than no gate. So the resolving entry points are computed by
CALL-GRAPH CLOSURE over `resolve_target` / `resolve_detour_address` inside
`crates/er-hook/src/lib.rs`: any function whose body reaches one of those is resolving, and every
public one of those is an API a caller can double-resolve through. The resolver PRODUCERS are
derived the same way, by closure over `resolve_game_address*` / `resolve_detour_address` inside
`crates/er-game-base/src/{game_build,mem}.rs` -- which is how `game_rva` and `game_rva_named` get
into the list without anyone typing them.

`*_runtime_derived` is excluded by construction rather than by name: those entry points do not reach
`resolve_target` at all (they audit the running image's `.pdata` instead), so the closure never
admits them.

A NAME IS NOT ONLY BOUND BY A `let`
-----------------------------------
The first cut of this gate seeded its taint from `let` bindings alone, and on 2026-08-31 that let a
real defect through in `er-refill-all::install`: the hook target was an element of an ARRAY LITERAL
destructured by a `for` pattern, so nothing seeded, and the `register_shared_hook(target, ..)` call
scored clean while one of its two rows resolved twice. `for <pattern> in [ .. ]` is therefore a
binding site too -- decomposed COLUMN BY COLUMN so that a table which resolves one column for a read
and passes a different, raw column to the hook API stays clean. See the block comment above
`for_pattern_bindings`.

NON-VACUITY
-----------
`--selftest` asserts the matcher on frozen controls: the pre-fix shape of `drive.rs:373` MUST be
flagged, the post-fix shape MUST NOT be, the pre-fix `for`-pattern table from `er-refill-all` MUST
be flagged while its read-only and mixed-column lookalikes MUST NOT, a blinded API list MUST
collapse the site count and trip the frozen minimum, and the derived lists must still contain the
entry points the runtime evidence names. A gate that cannot fail is a gate that proves nothing.

#
# COLUMN-ALIGNED, NOT WHOLE-PATTERN, and that is the precision this gate is required to keep. The

# raw column to the hook API. So the array literal is decomposed positionally: element `i` of every
# row lines up with name `i` of the pattern, and a name is tainted only when ITS OWN column
# contains a resolver call. Resolving in order to READ an address is correct; only the hook APIs
# double-resolve.
#
# When the shape cannot be decomposed with certainty -- a non-literal iterable, rows that are not
# tuples of the pattern's arity -- NOTHING is tainted. That is exactly the behaviour before this
# block existed, so an undecodable shape can never manufacture a false positive; it only declines
# to add reach. Precision over reach, per the header.
