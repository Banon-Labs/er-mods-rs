"""Which SYMBOL declares this address? Every spelling this tree uses, or an honest "I cannot tell".

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Two gates were caught on 2026-08-30 giving a confidently wrong answer to the same question, for
the same reason.

  `check-stale-rva-calls.py` searched for a SCREAMING_SNAKE constant added to a module base. It
  reported `1 known ungated site(s), none new` while roughly twenty real sites stood, because
  `er-title-flow` spells most of its addresses as enum variants
  (`ProfileLoadMenuRva::ProfileLoadSelectSaveSlot as usize`) and other crates reach one through its
  module (`jp::GAME_MAN_GLOBAL_RVA`).

  `check-1170-translation-collisions.py` searched for the literal `const NAME: usize = 0x<addr>;`
  and, finding none, printed "row B is claimed by no feature: deleting it removes this collision at
  zero cost." For 0xb0d400 that advice was WRONG AND DESTRUCTIVE. The declaration is
  `MenuJobWait = 0x00b0d400` inside `#[repr(u32)] pub enum MenuTraceRva`, reached through
  `pub const TITLE_MENU_JOB_WAIT_RVA: usize = MenuTraceRva::MenuJobWait as usize;`. The hex literal
  is in the tree; the SHAPE `const NAME: usize = 0x..;` is not. Its three live use sites are on the
  autoload path (`native_title_job.rs`, and twice in `title_load_step_hooks.rs`; a fourth mention is
  the string label passed beside one of them). Following the gate's own advice would have deleted a
  working feature's address.

Both failures are one failure: SEARCHING FOR A SPELLING FINDS SPELLINGS, NOT ADDRESSES. So this
module resolves VALUES. It reads every declaration form in `crates/`, evaluates each to a number,
and answers "which symbols equal this address" from the resolved values rather than from a regex
over the source text.

THE PART THAT MATTERS MORE THAN THE MATCHING
--------------------------------------------
"I found no reference" and "there is no reference" are different facts and MUST NOT print the same
sentence. A resolver has a residue -- declarations whose right-hand side it could not evaluate --
and while that residue is non-empty, any one of them could be the address. So `claims()` returns
`proven_unclaimed` as a separate field from `found_nothing`, and it is True only when

  * the walk read files (a scan that read nothing must never look like a clean scan);
  * NO declaration in the integer-valued universe resolved to the address;
  * NO bare hex literal of the address occurs in code (a `rva: 0xaec480` table field claims an
    address with no constant name at all -- er-reload-trace shipped exactly that); and
  * the residue that could hold THIS address is EMPTY.

A caller may only advise deletion when `proven_unclaimed` is True. Anything else is
"not proven", and the difference is a deleted feature.

THE UNIVERSE, stated so the proof means something
-------------------------------------------------
An address constant in Rust is an integer-typed `const`/`static`, an integer-repr enum's
discriminant, an element of an integer array/slice/tuple, or an integer `Range` band. Three classes
are then subtracted, each for a reason about what the thing IS rather than what it is called --
which is the discipline the failures above violated:

  * a NON-INTEGER type. A `&str` cannot hold an address, so an unevaluated one does not weaken the
    proof;
  * a type TOO NARROW for the address being asked about. A `u8` cannot be 0x7ad710, so an
    unevaluated `&[u8; 64]` byte string is not a declaration that might be it. This is
    query-relative: the residue is smaller for a large address than for a small one;
  * a value composed only of RUST TYPE LAYOUT -- `offset_of!`, `size_of`, `align_of` and integer
    literals, recursively. Those are lengths and intra-struct offsets, not addresses in
    eldenring.exe's image. A constant that ADDS a layout quantity to something else is NOT in this
    class and stays in the residue.

Measured on this tree, 2026-08-30: 5124 address-capable declarations, 285 unevaluated, 219 of them
layout-derived, 66 genuinely unread, and 4 wide enough to hold a `.text` RVA. Those four are what
stands between the three baselined collisions and a proof that nothing claims them.

    """`text` with every Rust comment AND string body blanked to spaces, offsets preserved.

    MOVED HERE FROM `check-stale-rva-calls.py` ON 2026-08-30 so both gates share one dialect
    instead of growing a third. That gate's baseline was contaminated by not doing this at all:
    two of its three rows were prose -- a `//` paragraph in `er-game-base/src/game_build.rs`
    explaining that "a stale address is equally reachable as a CALL (`transmute(base + RVA)`)",
    and a `///` doc comment in `er-invasion-warp-core/src/lib.rs` saying every call "used to be a
    bare `transmute(base + SOME_RVA)`". Both were recorded as findings. That is worse than a plain
    false positive: a ratchet whose baseline holds non-findings stays green while real sites are
    added beside them, and the next agent to shrink the baseline "fixes" a sentence.

    It matters in the other direction here. All three collision addresses this module was written
    for appear in `crates/` ONLY inside doc comments that describe the collision. Counting those
    as claims would make every address look live and the gate's advice useless; failing to blank
    them would be the mirror image of the bug it exists to fix.

    String BODIES are blanked for the same reason comments are, and it is the same failure one
    step along: `"// transmute(base + QUOTED_RVA)"` is a quoted example, not a call. Nothing
    either gate looks for can legitimately live inside a string literal, so blanking the body
    cannot hide a finding, while leaving it readable manufactures one.

    The two are parsed together rather than in separate passes, because each can quote the other:
    a `//` inside a string does not open a comment, and a `"` inside a comment does not open a
    string. Getting that backwards would blank live code. Block comments nest, as they do in Rust;
    raw strings honour their hash count; and a `'` is a char literal only when it closes,
    otherwise it is a lifetime and is stepped over.
