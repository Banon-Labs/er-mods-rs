# THIS RUN's copy of <name>: the redirect if the DLL honoured it, otherwise the game-directory
# fallback -- and never a file older than the launch. Both halves are load-bearing.
#
# The redirect is set from this script's side, but the DLL only obeys it if the env survives
# me3 -> Proton; when it does not, it writes into the game directory rather than nowhere, and a
# reader that knows only the run directory would report a healthy run as SILENT.
#
# `newer_than` is the other half, and it is what makes it safe to have stopped deleting the game
# directory's copy. That copy is the PREVIOUS run's file, complete and readable, so a reader that
# resolves by existence alone binds to it and scores a finished run as this one's. A stale file's
# mtime never changes either, so a freshness check downstream calls a perfectly healthy game
# frozen. The floor makes an old candidate unresolvable, and the honest answer -- the run
# directory's not-yet-written path -- is what is returned instead.
#
# The `env VAR=... "$ME3_BIN"` prefix used at launch does NOT put the redirects in this script's
# own environment, so `prefer` is passed explicitly: the artifact directory is what this script
# knows first-hand, and it beats anything inherited.
