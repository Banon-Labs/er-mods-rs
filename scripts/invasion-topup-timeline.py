"""Turn an `er-invasion-warp.log` into a live-top-up verdict.

The question a world-map run answers is narrow: did a legacy dungeon's real invasion points reach
the map WITHOUT a world re-entry? That is a specific ORDERING in the log -- a `TOP-UP claimed` line
falling between two `WorldMapViewModel ctor` lines, rather than one explained by a ctor. Reading
that ordering by eye out of a 30k-line log is how earlier runs got mis-summarised (a run was
reported as "no top-up fired" when the interesting question was which gate refused), so the
ordering is asserted here instead of eyeballed.

Also prints the decline reasons verbatim. Every refusal path in `top_up_live_pins` /
`restyle_live_pins` logs one, deduped in-process, so a run that shows nothing on screen still says
why in one line.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/invasion-topup-timeline.py [LOG_PATH]
    python3 scripts/invasion-topup-timeline.py --selftest

`LOG_PATH` defaults to the game-directory log, resolved from `ER_GAME_DIR` when set so the tool is
not pinned to one user's Steam layout.
