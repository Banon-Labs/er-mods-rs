"""Fail when two builds of the shipped cdylibs are not byte-identical.

Used by `.github/workflows/refactor-byte-identical.yml`: a PR that claims to be a
refactor / a move should not change what the game loads, so the DLLs built from
the merge-base and from the PR head are compared byte for byte.

BUILD NOISE IS NORMALIZED FIRST, AND ONLY BUILD NOISE. Two clean builds of
*identical* source differ in three PE fields, none of which is derived from the
code:

    - the COFF header TimeDateStamp          (wall-clock link time)
    - IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY.TimeDateStamp    (same)
    - the RSDS GUID + Age in the CodeView    (LLD reseeds it per link)
      debug record

Measured on crates/er-crash-logging: clean-build A vs clean-build B, same
source, differed in 10 bytes, all inside those three fields
(scripts/probe-dll-build-determinism.sh reproduces it). Leaving them in would
make the gate red on an empty diff -- it would be measuring the linker's clock.
The OptionalHeader CheckSum is zeroed for the same reason: it is a function of
the bytes we just zeroed.

...AND A FOURTH, WHICH THAT MEASUREMENT WAS STRUCTURALLY UNABLE TO SEE. The probe
above builds the SAME COMMIT twice; this gate builds TWO DIFFERENT ONES. Between
those two, one more thing changes with no help from the code:
crates/er-game-base/build.rs bakes `git rev-parse --short=12 HEAD` into
`ER_BUILD_GIT`, which the build watermark draws on screen, so every DLL that links
er-game-base carries a 12-byte ASCII commit id in .rdata -- and that is EVERY
shipped DLL. It therefore differs on every PR that has any commit at all, which
made this gate unpassable by construction rather than by anything an author did.

MEASURED, PR #392 run 33794571494: all 26 shipped cdylibs CHANGED, every one of
them by exactly 24 bytes in 2 runs of 12, every run in .rdata, and the report
printed the two strings for each -- 'a56af6a06c03' (the merge-base) against
'0be70e7616f6' (the head). The PR's only Rust changes were inside `#[cfg(test)]`
modules and a test-support crate, so the release cdylibs could not have differed
for any other reason. A gate that is red on a diff which cannot reach the
artifact is not measuring the artifact.

So the two build ids are masked, and ONLY those two: each image has its OWN
recorded sha replaced by a fixed placeholder of the same length. They are passed
in explicitly (--base-build-sha / --head-build-sha) rather than pattern-matched,
because "any 12 hex bytes" would be an allowlist for real .rdata content, and
this is not one -- it is two exact strings the caller already knows. Omit them
and nothing is masked.

Nothing else is normalized. There is no allowlist, no tolerance, no per-file
exemption -- every remaining byte counts, which is the point of the gate.

    usage: check-dll-byte-identical.py BASE_DIR HEAD_DIR

Exit 0 when every shipped DLL matches, 1 otherwise (or when the two directories
do not contain the same DLL set -- a refactor that stops producing an artifact
is exactly the regression this is meant to catch).
