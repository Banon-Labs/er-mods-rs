# "Is this DLL the code I am about to test?" -- the launch-time half of er-dll-provenance.py.
#
# WHY `[[ -f "$DLL" ]]` WAS NEVER A GATE
# --------------------------------------
# Every .me3 profile in this repo points its `[[natives]]` entries straight at
# target/<triple>/release/*.dll. There is no staging copy anywhere, so "staging" IS "building",
# and the only thing between a run and week-old code is a check made at launch time. Existence
# is not that check, because the stale DLL from last week exists. `cargo xwin build --release`
# honours `default-members = ["crates/er-quickload"]`, so it exits 0 in a fraction of a second
# having compiled none of the other shells -- and a run against what it left behind produces
# evidence for code that is not in the tree, which is indistinguishable from the feature not
# working. That is worse than not running at all, so this refuses.
#
# WHY NOT MTIME / THE PE TIMESTAMP
# --------------------------------
# Because cargo is RIGHT to skip relinking a crate whose forward dependency closure has not
# changed: a DLL two days older than its siblings can be perfectly current. A timestamp
# comparison therefore manufactures false staleness, and a gate that cries wolf is a gate people
# learn to route around -- the exact failure this exists to prevent. The sound test is a content
# hash over the compiled closure plus a build-noise-masked PE fingerprint, which is what
# scripts/er-dll-provenance.py records at build time and re-derives here.
#
# Usage -- source it, like scripts/steam-running.sh:
#     source "$REPO_ROOT/scripts/er-dll-freshness.sh"
#     require_fresh_dlls "$PRODUCT_DLL" "$HARNESS_DLL" || exit 3
#
# Callers pass PATHS. The cargo package each artifact belongs to is resolved from
# scripts/me3-dll-list.py -- the single source of truth for which cdylibs this workspace ships --
# so no caller keeps a second copy of the package->filename map (four crates override [lib] name,
# so that map cannot be derived by swapping dashes for underscores). An artifact this workspace
# does not build is a REFUSAL rather than a skip: guessing which crate a stray DLL came from is
# how an unchecked binary gets into a run.
#
# There is deliberately no bypass flag. The only way past this is to rebuild:
#     scripts/er-build-dlls.sh <package>...
#
# Self-test, both directions, no game and no cargo:
#     bash scripts/er-dll-freshness.sh --selftest
