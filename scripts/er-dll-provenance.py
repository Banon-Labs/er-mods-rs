"""Prove a staged DLL was built from the source tree you are about to test.

WHY MTIME IS NOT ENOUGH
-----------------------
The obvious freshness test -- "artifact newer than its newest source" -- is a claim about
clocks, not about content. A rebase rewrites mtimes, `touch` rewrites mtimes, and a restored
build cache can carry either order. It answers "was something written recently", never "was
THIS binary produced from THAT source".

Worse, the failure it needs to catch is silent. `cargo xwin build --release` honours
`default-members = ["crates/er-quickload"]`, so it builds ONLY the product and exits 0 in a
fraction of a second having compiled none of the other shells -- indistinguishable from a
successful incremental build. The stale DLL from last week stays exactly where it was, and a
run against it produces evidence for code that no longer exists.

WHAT THIS RECORDS INSTEAD
-------------------------
Provenance is captured AT BUILD TIME, because it cannot be reconstructed afterwards. Beside
each artifact, `<artifact>.provenance.json` records:

  * `source_sha`   -- a content hash over every file in the package's FORWARD dependency
                      closure (the crates whose source compiles into this DLL), taken from
                      the working tree: tracked files plus untracked non-ignored ones, since
                      cargo compiles what is on disk.
  * `fingerprint`  -- `dll-code-fingerprint.py` over the artifact, which masks the PE fields
                      that differ between two builds of identical source (COFF TimeDateStamp,
                      OptionalHeader CheckSum, IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY and its CodeView blob).
  * git SHA, dirty flag, build time, and the closure member list.

Verification recomputes both halves. A mismatch on `source_sha` means the source moved since
the build; a mismatch on `fingerprint` means the artifact was replaced by something else.
Either way the answer is "rebuild", and the caller is expected to fail loudly rather than
launch.

KNOWN LIMIT, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN
--------------------------------------
Path dependencies that live OUTSIDE this repo -- the sibling `../fromsoftware-rs` checkout
(`eldenring`, `fromsoftware-shared`) -- are not hashed, because they are not part of this
working tree. Editing the sibling and not rebuilding will NOT be caught. Those deps are
listed in `external_deps` on every provenance record so the gap is visible where it matters.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/er-dll-provenance.py write  --package er-quickload --artifact <path.dll>
    python3 scripts/er-dll-provenance.py verify --package er-quickload --artifact <path.dll>
    python3 scripts/er-dll-provenance.py --selftest

Exit status: 0 verified, 1 error, 3 stale/mismatched (so callers can tell them apart).
