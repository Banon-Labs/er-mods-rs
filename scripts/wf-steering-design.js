  '- The workflow SCRIPT runs in a sandboxed async JS context: NO filesystem, NO network, NO Node API. Date.now()/Math.random()/argless new Date() THROW. Standard JS builtins (JSON/Math/Array/String) are fine. The ONLY script hooks are: agent(prompt, opts) [returns the agents final text, or a schema-validated object if opts.schema], parallel(thunks) [barrier], pipeline(items, ...stages) [no barrier], log(msg), phase(title), args [the value passed in], budget, and workflow(name|{scriptPath}, args) [nest ONE level only].',
  '- The SUB-AGENTS spawned by agent() have FULL tools: Bash, Read, Write, Edit, and MCP tools via ToolSearch. They run in the same shell environment. So agents CAN read/write files, run processes, curl a local endpoint, etc.',
  '- No native mid-run user input: only tool PERMISSION prompts can pause a run. There is no message panel into a running workflow or its agents.',
  '- Concurrency cap ~min(16, cores-2); lifetime cap 1000 agents; <=4096 items per parallel/pipeline call. A worked example workflow can be RUN only by the main loop, not from inside another workflow.',
  '- KEY IMPLICATION: because the script sandbox has no fs but agents do, the ONLY way for the script to observe live external (user) input is to spawn an agent() that READS the channel (a file/socket/endpoint) and returns its contents; the script then branches on that return value. Worker agents can ALSO read a steering file themselves before finalizing.',

They accept it may be cooperative/poll-based. Deliverable must be usable to steer THIS repos RE/fix workflows next time.',

For each channel give: how the script/agents read it, the GRANULARITY at which steering takes effect (phase boundary / agent boundary / in-agent poll loop), latency, transparency (does the main orchestrator see the content?), and robustness (atomicity, races).',
  'Candidate channels to evaluate (add others): (1) a control DIRECTORY of files the script reads via a dedicated reader-agent between phases; (2) per-worker steering files each worker reads before finalizing; (3) an agent instructed to POLL a file in a bounded loop and return only when a signal appears (turns a phase into a wait-for-user gate); (4) a tiny local HTTP/socket "steering server" agents curl; (5) a named-pipe/queue; (6) an MCP tool the user drives.',

  '2. A demo workflow script scripts/wf-steering-demo.js that PROVES live steering: it loops (bounded, e.g. up to N rounds), each round spawns a reader-agent that reads the steering file and returns its contents (or the token NONE), logs what it saw, and BRANCHES: if the user wrote a redirect it changes what the next worker agent does; if the user wrote STOP it ends. Include a worker-agent whose prompt embeds "first read <your steering file>; if present treat as priority instructions". Use ONLY the real workflow hooks (agent/parallel/pipeline/log/phase/args). Remember Date.now/Math.random are unavailable -- vary rounds by index, not time.',
  '3. A tiny helper doc/snippet showing the exact reader-agent prompt and the worker boilerplate so future workflows can copy it.',

  'Then give an HONEST verdict: to what degree does this achieve the users desire ("change the flow transparently, still get what I want")? Where does it fall short of true interactive messaging, and is it worth building vs simply running steerable steps as individual Agent-tool subagents (which ARE messageable)?
