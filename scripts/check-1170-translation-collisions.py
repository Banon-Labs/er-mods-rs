"""Refuse a 1.16.2 -> 1.17 row whose DESTINATION is also some other row's SOURCE.

WHAT GOES WRONG, in the one sentence that matters
-------------------------------------------------
Translating an address twice does not fail. It SUCCEEDS, and returns a third, unrelated
function.

`er-game-base/build.rs` emits a table keyed by 1.16.2 RVA whose values are 1.17 RVAs. Given a
bare address the table cannot tell which side of the arrow it came from -- an address is just an
address. So if `A -> B` is a row and `B -> C` is ALSO a row, then resolving A gives B (correct),
and resolving B gives C (wrong, and silent). No error, no log line, no refusal: the second lookup
hits a real entry and hands back a confident answer for a function nobody asked about. A detour
installed on C writes five bytes into an unrelated live body; a call through C enters it.

MEASURED, 2026-08-30. `er-reload-trace`'s `native_submit_7ac890` resolved `0x7ac890 -> 0x7ad710`
through `register_shared_hook`, which handed the RESOLVED address to the product's union register,
which resolved again -- and `0x7ad710` is itself a tracked source, `-> 0x7ae590`. Both rows are
verdict-clean (`BYTE-IDENTICAL`, `BOTH-ENTRIES`), so nothing anywhere had a reason to complain.
That call path has since been restructured so the address travels UNRESOLVED and each branch
resolves exactly once, and `register_shared_hook_resolved` was deleted. Nothing prevents the next
row from recreating the shape, which is what this is for.

HOW A COLLISION IS BORN, and it is not by accident
--------------------------------------------------
All three collisions in the tree share one provenance. Their second row's `constant` column reads
`(refused at runtime 0x<its own source>)` -- somebody read `ADDRESS REFUSED ... 0x7ad710` out of a
game log and added a mapping for it. But that refusal was the SYMPTOM of a double resolve: the
address was refused because it is a 1.17 destination, and destinations are not keys. Adding the
row did not fix the refusal, it converted a loud refusal into a silent misroute -- exactly the
trade this repo refuses everywhere else, since a missing address costs a feature and a confident
wrong one corrupts.

So the gate calls that provenance out by name, and reports whether anything in `crates/` actually
declares the address -- through `scripts/rva_symbols.py`, which resolves VALUES rather than
searching for a spelling.

IT USED TO SEARCH FOR A SPELLING, AND THAT ADVICE WAS DESTRUCTIVE (fixed 2026-08-30)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The test was `grep -E "const [A-Z0-9_]+: *usize *= *0x<addr>;"` over `crates/`, and a miss printed
"row B is claimed by no feature: deleting it removes this collision at zero cost." For 0xb0d400
that sentence was wrong: the address is declared `MenuJobWait = 0x00b0d400` inside
`#[repr(u32)] pub enum MenuTraceRva` and reached through
`pub const TITLE_MENU_JOB_WAIT_RVA: usize = MenuTraceRva::MenuJobWait as usize;`. It is an enum
DISCRIMINANT, so the demanded shape never occurs, and it has live uses on the autoload path.
Following this gate's own remediation line would have deleted a working feature's address.
`check-stale-rva-calls.py` was caught the same morning, on the same spelling, for the same reason.

Two things changed. The question is now asked of a resolver that evaluates every declaration form
this tree uses -- literal consts and statics, enum discriminants, `use X as Y` aliases,
`const A = path::B` indirection, module-qualified names, arrays, `Range` bands, and bare hex
literals in table fields. And the ANSWER now has three values, not two: CLAIMED, PROVEN UNCLAIMED,
and NOT PROVEN. Only the second may license a deletion. "I found no reference" and "there is no
reference" are different facts, and printing them as the same sentence is what made a silent gate
into a destructive one.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT A COLLISION
------------------------------
Fatal shape -- `A -> B` with `A != B`, and `B -> C` with `B != C`. Double resolution yields C.

NOT a collision -- a row that did not move (`X -> X`). It is a destination and a source at once by
construction, and both answers are the same address, so a second resolve is idempotent. There are
22 such rows and flagging them would bury the three that matter. Nor is `A -> B` where the only
row keyed by B is `B -> B`: the second resolve returns B, which is the right answer.

IS A COLLISION ALWAYS FATAL?
----------------------------
No -- and the gate fails anyway, on purpose. A collision is inert while every address is resolved
exactly once, because a single resolve of A is simply correct. It becomes wrong the moment any
path resolves twice, and "resolve exactly once" is a CONVENTION spread across call graphs in six
crates and two DLLs. It has already been violated once, by a helper that looked entirely
reasonable at its call site. A convention that has been broken once, cannot be seen when it is
broken, and is one refactor away from breaking again is not a safeguard; it is a hope. The data
condition is checkable, so it is checked.

The runtime's own mitigation does not close this. `already_translated_in` hands an address back
untranslated when it is a destination -- but only when it is NOT also a source of a move, because
translation has to win for real sources. A collision address is both, so the shortcut declines and
the table answers. And `game_build.rs`'s doc for `resolve_on_running_build` states the opposite
("the only addresses that are BOTH a 1.17 destination and a 1.16.2 source are the ones that did
not move"), citing `verified_map_is_idempotent` as its enforcement -- a test that filters to rows
where `from != moved` and then asks a predicate that requires `from == moved`, so it is a tautology
that cannot fail. There is no existing machine check for this. That is why this file exists.

WHY THE RULES ARE PARSED OUT OF `build.rs` AND NOT COPIED
---------------------------------------------------------
Because copying them is a defect this repo has committed twice in one day. A sibling simulator
mirrored a stale `EXHAUSTIVE_VERDICTS` and reported the detour table as 42 rows instead of 374, a
confident number wrong by nine-fold; another gate still string-compares `"IDENTICAL"` while
`build.rs` carries three exhaustive verdicts. So every admission rule, every field index, every
ledger path and the `DIVERGES` literal are READ from `build.rs` at run time. If its shape changes
so the parse fails -- or if it grows a table constant this file does not model -- the gate REFUSES
rather than reporting a collision count it cannot stand behind.

BASELINE
--------
`scripts/1170-translation-collisions.baseline.tsv` records the collisions that have been looked at.
A collision that is not in it, or a baselined one that reaches a table it did not reach before,
fails the run. Baselined ones are printed in full on every run -- an allowlist that hides its
contents is how this class stays invisible. `--strict` ignores the baseline entirely and is the
mode to run once a collision has actually been cleared from the ledgers.

PROVEN UNCLAIMED IS NOT A DELETION LICENCE (2026-08-30, the SECOND correction)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`rva_symbols` can now evaluate every address-capable declaration in `crates/`, so all three
baselined addresses come back PROVEN unclaimed. That is a fact about this repo's SOURCE, and this
gate used to turn it straight into "deleting it removes this collision at zero cost." It must not,
for two reasons the resolver cannot see:

  * an address can be asked for by a value the source never spells -- computed from another
    constant, read out of a live vtable, recovered from a call site. Not hypothetical:
    `docs/recon/rva-1170-observed-refusals.txt` exists because 42 of the 54 addresses the running
    game asked for on 2026-08-29 were invisible to a declaration scan;
  * DELETING THE ROW DOES NOT MAKE A LATER REQUEST FAIL LOUDLY. With row B gone its source is a
    destination and no longer a source, so `already_translated_in` claims it and
    `resolve_on_running_build` hands the address BACK UNTRANSLATED -- no refusal, no log line --
    and on 1.17 that address is a DIFFERENT function. `deletion_failure_mode` computes this per row
    from the tables and prints it, because "if I am wrong the failure is loud" is the assumption
    the delete-it advice rested on, and for this shape it is false.

So the PROVEN branch reports what is proven and what is still owed, and NO branch may print a
sentence this file's own `COSTLESS_CLAIM` / `DELETION_ADVICE` detectors would refuse in a baseline
note -- the gate held notes to a standard its own prose did not meet. What actually settles a row
is a RUN: the log must show the address arriving only as some other row's translated output, never
as a first request. For all three baselined rows it does; the evidence is in the baseline notes.

    For this exact shape it is not. Row B's source is row A's DESTINATION, so once row B is deleted
    the source is a destination that no row claims as a source -- which is precisely the condition
    `already_translated_in` tests -- and the resolver hands the address straight back with no
