"""Align every function in the 1.16.2 image with its 1.17 counterpart.

WHY A WHOLE-IMAGE MAP
---------------------
`scripts/map-rvas-1162-to-1170.py` answers one address at a time by searching a
window around it, and on a trial of five it resolved two.  That is fine for a
handful of hooks and useless for the 159 raw `transmute(base + *_RVA)` game
calls this migration still has to carry forward -- each of which, unmapped,
is a crash of the kind measured on 2026-08-29: `er_invasion_warp_core::warp::
native::current_block_id` called 1.16.2's `0x1405eefb0`, which on 1.17 is the
second byte of a five-byte `call`, and the `9a` it landed on is a far call --
invalid in long mode, so #UD, so a dead game 491ms after load.

Both images carry a complete function table already: `.pdata` is an array of
RUNTIME_FUNCTION records, one per function with unwind data, and that is very
nearly every function in the binary.  So instead of searching per address, walk
both tables once and match functions by content.

HOW THE MATCHING WORKS
----------------------
A function's bytes cannot be compared literally across versions, because every
rip-relative displacement and every call target moved.  So each function gets a
SIGNATURE: its opening instructions with those operand bytes zeroed out, which
leaves opcodes, registers and immediates -- the parts that only change when the
code itself changes.

A signature that is unique on BOTH sides identifies one function on each, so the
pair is unambiguous.  Signatures shared by several functions (thunks, tiny
forwarders, `jmp` stubs) are left unpaired rather than guessed at; this tool's
value is entirely in not being wrong.

WHAT MAKES THE RESULT TRUSTWORTHY
---------------------------------
Not the method -- the calibration.  123 pairs are known independently: the 96
RVAs the sibling's own `binary-mapper` resolved on both versions (62 of them
from RTTI class names, which involve no pattern matching at all) and the 27
addresses this project hooks successfully.  `--selftest` requires that every one
of those the map covers agrees, and that its own byte check passes.  A map that
disagreed with a single RTTI-derived pair would be reporting a bug in itself.

    the k-th on the other. It is a weaker claim than uniqueness, so it is bounded to

    a wrong one the selftest says so.
