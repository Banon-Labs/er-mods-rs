"""Where the struct-field-drift tools keep their derived caches.

WHY THIS IS NOT A LITERAL IN FOUR SCRIPTS
-----------------------------------------
It was, and the literal contained a SESSION UUID:

    /tmp/claude-1000/-home-banon-projects-er-mods-rs/f1b1f237-.../scratchpad/struct-drift

That path is correct for exactly one agent session and wrong for every other one, including every
future run by the same user -- a scratchpad directory is created per session. The next agent gets
a path that does not exist, so `detect-struct-field-drift.py` reports "no scan output; run --scan
first" and `clear-fields-by-object.py` reports "missing rtti-joined.tsv" -- both loud, but both
describing a missing cache rather than the real cause, which is that the tool is looking in
somebody else's directory.

RESOLUTION ORDER
  1. `$ER_STRUCT_DRIFT_OUT`, so a caller can still point the tools anywhere.
  2. The legacy session scratchpad, but ONLY if it actually exists -- an agent that is mid-way
     through a scan keeps its cache instead of silently starting a new one somewhere else.
  3. `<repo>/target/struct-drift`, which is gitignored, current-user-owned and survives a reboot.

`--out-dir` still overrides all three on every tool that takes it.
