"""Refuse an Elden Ring launch whose changed code path has never been shown to execute.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
2026-08-04: a fix for the load2 `warpRequested` clear shipped, the user's screen was taken for a
launch, and the fix did nothing. Not because it failed to build -- it built, the gate was green, and
the loaded DLL's md5 matched the build byte for byte. It did nothing because its release condition
was *unreachable by construction*: it disarmed when `requestCode` latched 2, and the very state it
was scoped to (the load2 park) is DEFINED by `requestCode` staying 1 forever. The previous run's
telemetry already said so -- `oracle_stepfinish_request_code = 1`, `ig_d8 == 1` in every sample --
and reading it cost nothing.

A compile proves a predicate is well-typed. It says nothing about whether the state it names ever
occurs. That is the gap this gate closes, and it closes it OFFLINE, against evidence that already
exists, before anyone's screen is taken.

WHAT IT CHECKS
--------------
1. STALENESS -- every built DLL is newer than the sources it was built from. A launch that validates
   a DLL older than the tree is measuring a build that no longer exists.
2. REACHABILITY -- every registered predicate relevant to the selected named probe scope was
   OBSERVED true in a recorded run. A relevant predicate nobody has ever seen fire becomes an
   explicit obligation; a relevant predicate contradicted by a current run blocks the launch.

Registering a predicate is the point of contact: when you write a new release/disarm/gate condition,
add it here with the feature it protects and the oracle field or log pattern that proves it fired.
Named scopes select whole features, never hand-written predicate exclusion lists, so a scope cannot
silently omit one predicate while retaining another predicate for the same feature.
