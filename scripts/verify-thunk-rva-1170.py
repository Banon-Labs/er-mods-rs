"""Verify a 1.16.2 -> 1.17 pair whose function has NO `.pdata` extent.

WHY `verify-rva-map-1170.py` CANNOT DO IT
-----------------------------------------
That tool stops a decode at (1) the `.pdata` extent, (2) a `ret`, or (3) a `jmp` immediately
followed by an `int3`. A LEAF THUNK satisfies none of them. MSVC emits no unwind data for a
function that neither allocates stack nor saves a register, so there is no extent; the thunk ends
in a TAIL CALL, so there is no `ret`; and in this de-Arxan'd image the alignment gap after the
tail call is not `int3` padding -- it is whatever the deobfuscator left there, which differs
between builds.

The decode therefore runs off the end, through the gap, into the NEXT thunk and beyond, and the
first place the two builds' unrelated trailing bytes disagree is reported as the function
DIVERGING. That verdict is not merely useless: `er-game-base/build.rs::refuted_sources()` reads
`DIVERGES` as positive evidence the address is WRONG and subtracts it from the CALL map too. So an
over-read on a thunk that did not change removes a working address.

Measured examples, both `CS::KnowledgeLoadingScreen` `_Func_impl` lambdas:

    0x14090a0a0 -> 0x14090b240   verifier: DIVERGES 0.86, first diff at insn 10
    0x14090a0c0 -> 0x14090b260   verifier: DIVERGES 0.75, first diff at insn 4

Both thunks are 23 bytes and differ in exactly four bytes: the `lea rdx,[rip+X]` displacement to a
`.rdata` label literal that moved, and the tail-call `rel32` to a callee that moved. Every diff the
verifier found was past byte 23.

WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD
----------------------
It bounds the decode by REACHABILITY, which is the property a `.pdata` extent stands in for: an
unconditional `jmp` ends the function unless something already decoded branches past it. Then it
compares the two bodies BYTE for byte with the relocation-sensitive operand fields (RIP-relative
displacements, branch targets) masked out, and reports which bytes remain different.

A clean result is stronger evidence than `IDENTICAL`, not weaker: nothing is normalised away
except the fields a patch is REQUIRED to change. Immediates and struct displacements are compared
literally, so a retuned constant or a moved field shows up as a difference rather than vanishing.
