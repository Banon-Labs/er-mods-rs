# WHICH GIT_* VARIABLES DOES A HOOK ACTUALLY INHERIT? MEASURE IT; DO NOT ARGUE ABOUT IT.
#
# This exists because two agents produced contradictory answers on 2026-08-31 and the
# disagreement was load-bearing: `scripts/check-git-hooks-installed.sh --selftest` builds its
# fixtures with `git init` and `git -C <fixture> config ...`, and `git -C` does NOT override
# GIT_DIR. So IF a hook exports GIT_DIR, every one of those fixture commands is redirected at the
# live repository and the selftest silently rewrites the hook configuration it exists to protect.
# Whether that is a real route or only a theoretical one comes down to one measurable fact.
#
# The measurement has a trap in it, which is why this is a script and not a one-liner: a hook that
# NEVER RAN reports exactly the same thing as a hook that ran and inherited nothing -- an empty
# list. So the dumper always writes a marker line first, and --selftest refuses to pass unless
# every hook it expected actually fired.
#
# It covers the cell the earlier measurement missed: a LINKED WORKTREE. There, GIT_DIR is
# <main>/.git/worktrees/<name> -- a git dir NOT named `.git` -- and `git init` under it writes
# `core.bare = true` into the SHARED <main>/.git/config. That is the exact damage observed on the
# main checkout on 2026-08-31. See bd hooks-selftest-under-git-hook-blanks-the-live-config-2026-08-31.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/measure-git-hook-env.sh            # report, exit 0
#   bash scripts/measure-git-hook-env.sh --selftest # report + assert the harness itself is sound
