"""Fail when the product installs a DETOUR on an address with no detour-safe 1.17 mapping.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
On 2026-08-30 a user launched the game and played for seven minutes with the mod's
loading-screen cover pasted over live gameplay. The cause was not a logic bug: it was
`LOADING_SCREEN_GFX_FADEOUT_RVA` (1.16.2 `0x90a0a0`). That address is in the CALL map, so
`game_rva` happily translated it to `0x90b240` and the code proceeded to `MhHook::new` -- which
consults the STRICTER detour map, found nothing, and refused. Correctly. Loudly. 8,430 times,
once per retry, for the whole session.

`oracle_loading_screen_gfx_fadeout_hook_installed = 0` in the telemetry. `HOOK REFUSED` in the
log. And NOTHING in the build or the check pipeline noticed, because the only place the refusal
existed was a 412 MB runtime log that somebody had to launch the game to produce.

That is the gap. Two facts were both already in the tree the whole time -- "this source line
installs a detour on RVA X" and "X is not in DETOUR_SAFE_1162_TO_1170" -- and no gate put them
next to each other.

WHAT IT IS NOT
==============
* `audit-1170-readiness.py` / `check-stale-rva-calls.py` gate addresses that reach the game
  WITHOUT the version gate. Every address here goes THROUGH the gate; the gate is what refuses
  them. Opposite class.
* `audit-1170-coverage-inventory.py --report` already prints a `detour_licence_only` table, and
  that table is where this idea came from. It is a REPORT, its detour attribution is a +/-30-line
  proximity heuristic, and nothing runs it in `check.sh` with a non-zero exit. A report nobody
  fails on is how seven minutes of covered gameplay happens.
* It says nothing about whether a MAPPED destination is the right function. That is
  `verify-rva-map-1170.py` and `audit-1170-hook-targets.py`.

THE VOCABULARY IS DERIVED, NEVER TRANSCRIBED
============================================
Every verdict string, entry-evidence word, instruction floor, TSV path and column index this
script uses is PARSED OUT OF `crates/er-game-base/build.rs` at runtime -- see
`read_build_vocabulary`. Not one of them is spelled in this file.

That is not tidiness, it is the difference between a gate and a decoration. Nine audits in this
repo have reported a confident ZERO because they transcribed a literal that later drifted:
`verified_rvas()` filtered on `"IDENTICAL"` and matched 0 of 99 rows; `check-rva-alias-drift.py`
had the same bug and then `assert bad == 0` PASSED OVER AN EMPTY SET. A gate that reads its
vocabulary from the source of truth tracks a rename for free, and `--selftest` refuses to run at
all if the parse comes back empty -- an unparsable `build.rs` must fail LOUDLY, never quietly
license every detour in the tree.

THE INSTALLER LIST IS DERIVED TOO
=================================
Which functions actually consult the detour map is read out of `crates/er-hook/src/lib.rs` by
call-graph closure over `resolve_target` / `resolve_detour_address` -- so a new entry point, or a
rename, is picked up without an edit here. The `*_runtime_derived` variants fall out of the
closure on their own, because they genuinely do not consult the table (they audit the RUNNING
image's `.pdata` instead), and they are listed rather than silently dropped.

ADDRESSES ARE RESOLVED BY VALUE, NOT BY SPELLING
================================================
Almost no call site passes a constant. It passes a local:

    let Ok(addr) = game_rva(PLAYER_GAME_DATA_NAME_GETTER_RVA as u32) else { ... };
    MhHook::new(addr as *mut c_void, hook as *mut c_void)

so a regex for `MhHook::new(.*_RVA` finds ONE of the 114 sites in this tree. This walks the
binding backwards inside the enclosing function -- `let`, `let ... else`, `if let`, `match` arms,
`for` tuple destructuring, plain assignment, and function parameters followed to their callers --
and resolves the names it lands on through `scripts/rva_symbols.py`, which evaluates
declarations to NUMBERS and so sees enum discriminants and derived constants that no regex for
`_RVA` would.

MEASURED, 2026-08-30, WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON TO BELIEVE ANY OF THE ABOVE
=========================================================================
Run against the recon ledger AS COMMITTED at the time this was written -- before the three rows
were repointed in the working tree -- the gate flags exactly three addresses, and they are the
three the session went wrong on:

    0x25f8e0  CALL-MAPPED, DETOUR REFUSED  .../quit_menu/profile_rows_system_quit_menu.rs:41
    0x90a0a0  CALL-MAPPED, DETOUR REFUSED  .../er-loading-portrait-core/dlstring_lookat_math.rs:681
    0x90a0c0  CALL-MAPPED, DETOUR REFUSED  .../er-loading-portrait-core/stats_loading_text.rs:551

All three were `IDENTICAL-SHORT` at HEAD -- a verdict `build.rs` admits to the CALL map and
refuses the detour map -- and are `IDENTICAL-LEAF` in the working tree, which is what makes the
gate green today. It is the same tree, the same scan and a three-row ledger diff, so the gate is
reading the ledger and not agreeing with itself.

The third of those, `0x90a0a0`, is the one worth pointing at. Its install site is
`MhHook::new(address as *mut c_void, hook.detour)` forty lines below `for hook in &hooks`, where
`hooks` comes from `fn observer_hooks() -> [ObserverHook; 5]`, and each record spells its address
`rva: LOADING_SCREEN_GFX_FADEOUT_RVA as u32`. Naming that address takes the array-return-type fix
in `function_bodies`, the `for`-pattern binding, the built-table miner and `rva_symbols`' value
resolution, all four. Without any one of them the gate reports two of three and looks fine.
