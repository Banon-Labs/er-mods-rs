"""Behavioral tests for the cupcake signal `last_assistant_diagnosis_without_fix`.

The signal scans the last completed assistant turn and emits one facts line:

  DIAGFACTS|diagnosis=..|fixed=0|1|asked=0|1|blocked=0|1|promise=..|edited=0|1
           |handback=..|handbackkind=a|b|c|userneed=0|1|didwork=0|1|extblocked=0|1|carried=0|1
           |unread=..|consulted=0|1|future=0|1|deferral=..

Four rules read it, and the conjunctions live in
`.cupcake/policies/claude/no_diagnosis_without_fix.rego` where
`.cupcake/tests/no_diagnosis_without_fix_test.rego` covers them:
  * `ER-EFFECTS-NO-DIAGNOSIS-WITHOUT-FIX`   -- a defect named, no file changed;
  * `ER-EFFECTS-NO-PROMISSORY-CLOSER`       -- a fix announced in the present participle, nothing
                                               written;
  * `ER-EFFECTS-NO-ZERO-INFORMATION-STOP`   -- a turn whose ideal next user reply is nothing;
  * `ER-EFFECTS-NO-DEFERRED-INVESTIGATION`  -- the agent's own next investigative move named
                                               instead of taken.

This file covers the extraction, which is where the two 2026-09-09 rules do their hard work: both
key on a grammar that ordinary reporting prose also uses. "Fixing both: bypass the union ..."
announces work; "Adding the field to the struct fixed it" reports it, and the difference is a
construction rather than a word. The cases below are the ones that separate them, and several of
them are transcript sentences the first drafts got wrong -- kept here verbatim so a widening cannot
quietly reintroduce them.

Driven against crafted transcript JSONL under a temporary home, so the signal's
`~/.claude/projects/<cwd-key>/*.jsonl` discovery resolves to the fixture.
