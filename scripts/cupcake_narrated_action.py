"""Detect a turn that ends by narrating the action it is taking instead of by having taken it.

The failure, verbatim from one session on 2026-09-10, all five turn-final and all with the action
either already dispatched or dispatchable in the same turn:

    Re-running it now without the cap.
    Rebuilding and relaunching now.
    Bringing it up to read the pointer chain live rather than guessing another offset:
    Making the empty read diagnosable - logging each of the three hops so the next invasion says
      which one returned zero instead of just that one did:
    Dispatching a subagent to enumerate the menu builder's rows properly, and unblocking you now by
      narrowing the guard:

The user's words when they finally called it out:

    "'Re-running it now without the cap' me: *points to the rego policy you `MUST` update to
     disallow this prose without a stop hook*"

They had already named the general form twice earlier in the same session -- "Announcing your own
next action instead of taking it", which is also how `AGENTS.md` spells it in the stop-too-early
list, and "Why do you insist on going 'My real point <em-dash> massive amount of prose that is
never worth reading'".

This is the present-progressive sibling of `cupcake_future_commitment.py`, which only reaches the
first person future ("next run I'll ...", "I'm going to ..."). A bare participial clause commits
nobody and names no future, so its opener pattern never sees one.

Two things keep it off ordinary work, and both are structural rather than a judgement about intent:

  * the signal that drives this module exits when a tool call follows the turn's last prose, so a
    mid-turn one-line preamble between two tool calls is never read. `wall_of_text.rego` says the
    same thing in its own correction text: mid-turn narration between tool calls is fine and is not
    measured; this is about the message you close on.
  * the narration has to be the last sentence of that closing prose. A narration with a clause hung
    off it -- "Rebuilding and relaunching now; the one thing I'll need from you afterwards is a
    single use of the item." -- belongs to `ER-EFFECTS-NO-ZERO-INFORMATION-STOP`, which was written
    for that exact sentence, and charging it twice would be two rules quoting one clause.

Kept as an importable module rather than an inline heredoc so the classifier is testable without a
live transcript, the way `cupcake_future_commitment.py` and `cupcake_challenged_convention.py` are.
The transcript walk and the turn bucketing stay in `cupcake_turn_scan.py`, shared with every
neighbouring signal.

# The user's words: "There's a rego policy that should have caught you saying 'and I'm starting on

# above cannot reach it.
#
# Dropping the anchor is not the fix: it is there because an unanchored search convicted the two
# reports quoted above. The trailing clause is accepted only under conditions that neither of those
# two meets, all three required:
#   * a clause boundary in front of the subject -- a comma, a semicolon, a colon or a spaced dash,

#     an end-anchored "now" or a colon. "..., and I'm restarting the full 26-shell relink" ends on
#     neither;
#   * nothing but the announcement to the right of it. A comma after the verb means another clause
#     follows, and the "now" that closes the sentence belongs to that one rather than to this --
