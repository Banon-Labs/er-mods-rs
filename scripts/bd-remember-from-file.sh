# Store a bd memory whose body lives in a file.

# `bd remember` takes the insight as one shell argument, and a multi-paragraph
# reverse-engineering note is exactly the kind of text that does not survive
# being typed on a command line: backticks, `*(this+0x8b0)`, quotes and newlines
# all get mangled or eaten by the shell before bd sees them. Writing the note to
# a file and passing the PATH keeps the bytes intact.

#
# The bd binary is invoked at its real path on purpose: the bare `bd` command is
# an interactive-shell guard function that agent shells do not get.
