"""Every constant whose value is an EXPRESSION must evaluate, or be listed here with a reason.

WHY. Two audits on 2026-08-31 hit the same wall from opposite directions, and it is the same
defect both times: a constant whose initialiser is not a bare literal is INVISIBLE to the tool that
is supposed to check it, and invisible reads exactly like checked.

  * ADDRESS SIDE. `ADD_DEFAULT_FILE_LOAD_PROCESS_RVA: usize = 0x142658c60 - 0x140000000` was
    harvested by a regex that captures the first hex literal, so the recorded value was the
    MINUEND -- an absolute VA, not the RVA the constant holds. It matched nothing in an RVA-keyed
    map, landed in `missing`, and was neither checked nor reported as unchecked. It is a real
    `.text` function (`FD4::FD4FileCap::AddDefaultFileLoadProcess`) and it MOVED on 1.17.
  * OFFSET SIDE. The field-offset inventory filed an initialiser it could not read as
    `kind="expr", resolved=None` and stopped there. 41 of 813 live game-struct-field offsets were
    in that state -- dropped from the census without appearing in the unattributed ratchet either.

`scripts/const_fold.py` folds the restricted grammar both tools need. This gate is what stops the
class coming back: a constant that no inventory can evaluate FAILS, naming the constant and its
definition site, unless it is in `UNRESOLVABLE` below.

THE LIST AND THE DETECTOR CHECK EACH OTHER, in both directions, the same shape as
`rva_role.NOT_AN_ADDRESS`:

  * an unresolvable constant that is NOT listed fails -- that is the invisibility this closes;
  * a LISTED constant that now resolves fails too. A stale entry is worse than a missing one: it
    silently excuses a value the tree has since learned how to compute, so the number goes
    unchecked while the list claims that is deliberate.

# arrivals. (All 28 were the `er-build-import-runtime` rename to `*_RVA`, so nothing actually lost
# coverage -- but nothing said so either, and a rename that dropped the `_RVA` instead would have
