"""The complete STATIC inventory of 1.17 exposure, per cdylib.

WHY A STATIC INVENTORY AND NOT THE LOGS
---------------------------------------
`er-game-base` refuses any 1.16.2 address with no verified 1.17 mapping and logs the refusal.
That log is the obvious work list and it is the wrong one: a refusal is only written when the
code path actually RUNS. One 25-hour session logged 679,812 refusals across eight DLL logs, and
that is a FLOOR -- every feature nobody triggered is silent, and some cannot easily be triggered
at all. So the work list has to come from the SOURCE.

WHAT IT COUNTS
--------------
Every game address a cdylib can resolve, found in four declaration forms. Missing any one of
them under-reports, and the third form has already cost a black screen:

  1. `const FOO_RVA: usize = 0x749b20;`
  2. `const FOO_RVA: usize = BAR_RVA;`                     -- derived from another constant
  3. `const FOO_RVA: usize = SomeEnum::Variant as usize;`  -- the value lives on the enum; a
     literal-hex scan misses all 37 of these. `TITLE_TOP_DIALOG_IS_IN_STATE_RVA` is one.
  4. a bare literal in a hook/seam table (`HookSpec { rva: 0x836f30, detour: ... }`), which
     carries no `_RVA` name at all. er-reload-trace declares 39 addresses this way and
     er-invasion-warp's `MapSeam` table another 13.

WHOSE MODULE IS IT
------------------
An address is a GAME address because of the BASE it is added to, NOT because its name ends in
`_RVA`. One DLL's address list can name several modules: `er-invasion-warp` resolves Seamless
Co-op with `GetModuleHandleA("ersc.dll")` and adds four RVAs to that base. Classifying by name
put all four on the unmapped GAME work list, where translating one through the 1.17 map and
detouring the result would have written five bytes of jmp into an unrelated `eldenring.exe`
function. Those are reported under `foreign`, and literals that are not addresses at all --
`*_RVA_LIMIT` plausibility bounds, the two ends of a `callstack_contains_game_rva(start, end)`
RANGE -- under `not_addresses`. Both classes have `--selftest` cases, with real game addresses
as the control so an exclusion that ate real work fails too.

HOW IT CLASSIFIES
-----------------
The authority is not a TSV; it is the two tables `er-game-base/build.rs` generates, which this
script reproduces exactly (asserted by --selftest against the built `address_map_1170.rs`):

  call_ok    the address is in VERIFIED_1162_TO_1170, so `game_rva` / `resolve_game_address`
             will translate it. Assembled from the DETOURABLE rows of
             rva-map-1162-to-1170.verified.tsv, ALL rows of .needed.tsv, ALL rows of .data.tsv,
             minus the quarantine and minus every DIVERGES verdict.
  detour_ok  the address is in DETOUR_SAFE_1162_TO_1170 -- the stricter licence, which needs
             both a body comparison and BOTH-ENTRIES/NEITHER-ENTRY evidence from .pdata.
  prov       where the row came from: VERIFIED / DATA / FUNCTION / HELD-BACK / NONE.

An address with `call_ok = false` WILL be refused the moment its path runs.
