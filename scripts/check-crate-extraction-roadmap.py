"""RATCHET `crates/er-effects-rs/src/experiments/**` and verify the critical caller ledger.

`er-effects-rs` is being extracted INTO crates until it is a thin shim that bundles them, so
the line count under `experiments/**` is a number that may SHRINK but must never GROW. The
ledger row in the roadmap is the high-water mark; this gate fails when measured source has
climbed past it.

It is a ratchet, NOT a freeze. Edits are free -- a bug fix that rewrites 300 lines in place
passes untouched, and so does a refactor that moves lines between files. Only NET GROWTH in
the total is refused, and `--refresh` accepts growth in one command. The value is not that
growth is impossible; it is that growth becomes a reviewable diff to the ledger instead of
the invisible default.

Why growth, not equality: measured across the four commits of PR #367, 62% of 1,553 added
lines already landed in extracted crates with no enforcement at all, because the host-seam
pattern pulls them there. The leak that pattern does NOT catch is a NEW MODULE born inside
the shim -- `experiments/continue_load/picked_summary_refresh.rs` arrived as 187 fresh lines
with no reason to start there, while a same-sized chunk of the same PR correctly landed in
`er-save-redirect`. Most of the remaining 595 shim lines were genuinely mandatory (telemetry
emission, `product_continue` spine wiring, `path_hooks` seams), so a blanket freeze would
have blocked real work for no gain.
