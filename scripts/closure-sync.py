"""Copy a candidate closure's paths from the main checkout into a pinned worktree.

Reads newline-separated repo-relative paths on stdin (blank lines and `#` comments ignored),
resets the worktree to its pinned HEAD, then copies each path in. A path that is DELETED in the
main checkout is deleted in the worktree too. Prints a sha256 for each copied file so the caller
can re-verify the same bytes at commit time.

The source checkout is the repo this script lives in (`$ER_MODS_ROOT` overrides), not a
hard-coded home directory -- a literal `/home/<someone>` here silently resolves to nothing
under a different user and the copy loop then reports every path DELETED, which reads as
"the closure is empty" rather than "you looked in the wrong checkout".

The target MUST be a linked `git worktree`, and that is checked rather than trusted: this
script runs `git checkout -- .` and `git clean -fdq` on it, so pointing it at a main
checkout by mistake would destroy exactly the uncommitted pile it exists to help land. A
linked worktree's `.git` is a FILE containing a `gitdir:` pointer; a main checkout's is a
directory. That is the whole discriminator, and it is cheap.
