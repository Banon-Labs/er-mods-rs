"""ORACLE VERDICT emitter (user 2026-07-20): the agent must NOT hand-read logs to explain a run.

Given a run directory (or its telemetry-timeseries.jsonl), print ONE plain-language verdict that says,
per load epoch: the PHASE reached, whether the run was CONTAMINATED (the character moved without any
injected input -- ER accepts UNFOCUSED mouse/click input and agent-owned runs do not block it, so
incidental user movement corrupts the run), and the TEARDOWN reason (timeout window vs
semaphore-complete vs stall). The target shape is exactly the sentence the user asked for, e.g.:

  "I entered load2, the run was corrupted by mouse/click input the game accepted while unfocused
   (we did not block it), and I tore down at the prescribed timeout window."

Contamination is derived from oracle_did_move_frames > 0 while oracle_supplied_movement_input_frames
== 0 (movement with no injected input) and/or oracle_harness_move_verdict == 3 (contaminated). NOTE:
there is no focus/camera field in telemetry yet, so "while unfocused" is the *likely cause*, not a
measured fact, until a window-focus oracle is added -- the verdict says so explicitly.

Usage: python3 scripts/oracle-verdict.py <run-dir | timeseries.jsonl> [--observe-seconds N]
Exit: 0 always (it is a reporter, not a gate).
