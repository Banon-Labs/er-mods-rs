"""Which constants this workspace USES as game addresses, derived from the call sites.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A FOURTH NAME REGEX
------------------------------------------------------
`select-needed-1170-rows.py` decides what to translate by scanning for constants whose NAME
carries `RVA`. That question -- "is this spelled like an address?" -- is not the question that
matters, and it has now been answered wrong four times:

  * `_BOUND`-suffixed names, filtered out of selection and thereby out of the "is it declared?"
    question too;
  * `Enum::Variant as usize` aliases, whose value lives in another file -- 37 of them, and the
    miss black-screened the game;
  * bare `rva: 0x...` fields in `HookSpec`/`MapSeam` literals with no constant name at all -- 53
    of them, refused at runtime under no name anyone could search for;
  * and, measured 2026-08-30, every one of the 27 game functions `er-build-import-runtime` calls,
    named `GET_WEAPON_NAME`, `SET_REINFORCEMENT`, `EQUIP_ITEM_TO_CHR_ASM_SLOT` and so on. Zero of
    the 27 were visible. The build importer silently applied nothing: the six `MsgRepository`
    name getters were refused, so every item name failed to resolve, so `read_character.rs`
    dropped all 18 equipped items, so "Generate Build Link" exported an itemless build and "Load
    Build from URL" applied none. The log said `catalog: 0 named, 6966 unnamed` and the telemetry
    said success.

The question that MATTERS is "does this workspace hand the constant to the address resolver?"
That is a property of the CALL SITE, not of the spelling, and it cannot drift as names drift.
A constant passed to `native::resolve` IS a game address by construction -- there is no other
reason to pass it -- so this module answers by reading the argument lists.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
----------------------------------
It does not guess from the VALUE. A value threshold was measured first and rejected: admitting
any uppercase hex constant at or above `0x1000` pulls in eleven constants that are not addresses,
ten of them because they are exactly `0x1000` -- which is where `.text` begins and therefore
where a function begins, so they pair cleanly against the function map and mean nothing. That is
the same trap `select-needed-1170-rows.py::BOUND` already documents for `AV_GAME_TEXT_RVA_MIN`.
`MEM_COMMIT`, `DDSD_PIXELFORMAT` and `MINIDUMP_WITH_THREAD_INFO` are Win32 flags; translating one
would write a wrong row into a tracked ledger, and the ledger's own docstring is explicit that a
wrong row that survives forever reads as a live value and is worse than a missing one.

Usage has no such failure mode: nothing passes `MEM_COMMIT` to an address resolver.

# =============================================================================================
# The same question asked of a value with NO NAME AT ALL
# =============================================================================================
#
# WHAT WAS STILL INVISIBLE AFTER EVERYTHING ABOVE. Every form above starts from an identifier, so
# all of them are blind to an address that never becomes one:
#
#     let g = |rva: u32| game_rva(rva).ok();
#     let repo_gate = g(0x0485cbec) ...
#
# Five addresses are written that way in `menu_trace_hooks.rs` and, measured 2026-08-31, four of
# them held no row in ANY ledger. They were neither verified nor reported as unverified -- the
# third state, worse than either, because a missing row reads exactly like an address nobody has
# gotten to yet. On 1.17 all four were refused at runtime (`game_rva` fails closed, so the
# CAPSTATE-SUBSYS line printed -1/0 rather than garbage) and the resource-repository diagnostic
# they exist to produce had been silently dark since the 1.17 bump.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT A HEX SCAN. `rva_symbols` already indexes every bare hex literal in `crates/`,
# and that population is tens of thousands of numbers: struct offsets, Win32 flags, masks, the
# `> 0x10000` pointer-sanity test that appears 40 times in the one file above. Admitting by VALUE
# was measured and rejected upstream in this module's own docstring. So the question here is the
# same one the named forms ask -- DOES THIS WORKSPACE HAND THE NUMBER TO THE ADDRESS RESOLVER? --
# and nothing else. A literal that is compared, masked, added to a struct base or passed to
# `VirtualAlloc` is not reported no matter what it looks like.
#
# THE ONE HOP. The literals above do not reach `game_rva` directly; they reach a local closure
# that forwards to it. Refusing to follow that would answer "zero bare addresses in this
# workspace", which is the wrong answer by exactly the five that matter -- and refusing a real
# address is the direction this repo has already been wrong in four times. So a `let NAME = |P|
# ... RESOLVER(P) ...;` binding is followed, one hop, in the file that declares it. Measured over
# `crates/` on 2026-08-31: two such bindings exist, and the whole population this module reports
# is 5 literals in 1 file. Zero of them are direct calls -- without the hop this finds nothing.
