"""Detect a closing message that calls a change a fix when no run showed the change working.

User, 2026-09-11: "If someone ever says real fix to me and doesn't put it in airquotes, I look at
them like this" -- and then, when nothing stopped it: "We are supposed to have a rego policy that
stops you from saying 'fix' without runtime evidence". The turn that prompted it had edited a crate
that ships inside the game, never run the game, and closed on "the real fix". It failed live on the
next launch.

Kept as an importable module rather than an inline heredoc so it is unit-testable without a live
transcript, the way `cupcake_narrated_action.py` and `cupcake_unbacked_claim.py` are.
`.cupcake/signals/last_assistant_fix_claim_without_runtime_evidence.sh` imports it, and so does
`scripts/test-fix-claim-classifier.py`, so the test cannot pass against a classifier production
does not run.

The vocabulary this module owns, and the boundary it must not cross: the present participle
"fixing" belongs to `ER-EFFECTS-NO-PROMISSORY-CLOSER`, which already halts on "Fixing both: ...".
Charging one sentence twice with two different corrections is how a guard layer becomes noise, so
no pattern here matches it.

#   er-<name>.log        the per-module log a loaded DLL writes, the `er-*.log` family the
#                        runtime-evidence push guard already reads: er-quit-menu.log,
#                        er-quickload-autoload-debug.log, er-invasion-warp.log, and the rest;
#   er-<name>telemetry<name>.json  the oracle dump, er-quickload-telemetry.json and its siblings;
#   er-<name>.jsonl      the streamed records: phases, timeseries, profile, bootstrap, input trace;
#   er-me3-runs          the run root a launch writes its artifact directory under;
#   br-<date>-<time>-<id>  a run id, the same shape the proof-without-observation guard reads;
#   oracle_<field>       a named in-process memory-read semaphore;
#   er-live-fields.py    a read of the live process through /proc/<pid>/mem;
#   er-teardown.py --status   the live-session state read, which needs both tokens together;
#   er-readiness-watch.py     the watcher that collects the semaphores during a run;
#   er-frida-watch.py         an attached agent reading the running game.
#
# What is deliberately absent, because each of them was offered as proof in the turn that prompted
# this rule: `cargo build`, `cargo xwin build`, `cargo test`, `cargo check`, `scripts/er-build-dlls.sh`,
# `scripts/check-rust-build.sh`, a `sha256sum` of the artifact, `scripts/er-run-branch.py`, and

    `changed` is a write to a crate that ships in a DLL. `evidence` is a run artifact opened at or

    the code that was there before it. Measured from the first such write rather than the last, so
    a turn that reads the log and then makes one more small edit still counts as having looked.

    The anchor moves forward again for a rebuild. A measurement taken before the artifact was built
    again describes the previous artifact, so the read has to come after the last build in the turn:
    the claim is about the DLL that is loaded now, not about the one that was loaded when the log
    was written. That is the letter of the correction -- since the most recent build of the artifact
    in question, has a measurement actually been read -- and it is the one tightening here that a
