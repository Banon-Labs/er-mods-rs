"""Behavioral tests for the cupcake signal `last_assistant_unexecuted_promise`.

The signal scans the last-completed assistant turn of the session transcript and returns:
  * PROMISE:<clause>  -- the turn ENDED on a first-person promise to do concrete work, nothing in the
                         turn executed it, no background task or shell is carrying it, and the message
                         did not hand the obligation to the user.
  * ""                -- clean, which includes every one of those four facts being absent.

The false-positive cost is high (a guard that cries wolf gets ignored), so most of this file is the
NEGATIVE side: the shapes that look like the defect and must stay silent.

We drive the real signal against crafted transcript JSONL under a temporary HOME so its
`~/.claude/projects/<cwd-key>/*.jsonl` discovery resolves to our fixture, then assert the tag.
