"""Name the code a WEDGED ELDEN RING is parked in, without attaching a debugger.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
On 2026-08-29 the game stopped rendering ~12 s into boot with every thread asleep and zero CPU,
and four consecutive hypotheses about the cause were tested by rebuilding, relaunching, and
watching the same number come back. Each cost minutes and falsified exactly one guess. The
process was sitting right there the whole time with the answer in its stacks.

This reads them. No `frida.attach` -- that KILLS this target (bd
`frida-attach-kills-wine-eldenring-use-proc-mem-2026-08-12`) -- and no ptrace stop: it opens
`/proc/<pid>/mem` and scans each thread's stack for values that land inside the game image, the
same poor-man's unwind `er-crash-logging` uses for its `callers=` line. A scanned stack contains
dead frames as well as live ones, so a hit is a CANDIDATE, not a call stack; what makes it useful
is that the candidates cluster, and an address on many threads at once is where they are waiting.

WHAT IT WAITS FOR
-----------------
`--until-wedged` polls total process CPU and only dumps once it flatlines, because a dump taken
while the game is still working describes a game that is working. The flatline threshold is
deliberately strict: a boot that is merely slow still burns hundreds of ticks a second.
