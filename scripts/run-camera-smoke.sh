# built DLL and the manual-portrait-drive env, pinning ARTIFACT_DIR to a known path so the DLL's
# portrait-capture-slot*.bin dumps (written next to ER_QUICKLOAD_AUTOLOAD_DEBUG_PATH) are easy to find.
#
# Prereqs (the probe's own preflight re-checks these and fails closed): Steam running; no eldenring.exe
# already running; the diagnostic flag files staged in GAME_DIR
# (er-quickload-{no-autoload,force-profile-render,portrait-real-pixels}.txt). The human drives to LOAD
# GAME and holds ~20s; the DLL applies the custom camera and dumps each slot once. Tear down with
# `pkill -x eldenring.exe` and remove the flag files when done.
