"""Fold a Rust integer constant whose value is an EXPRESSION, or say why it could not be.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Every tool in this repo that audits addresses or field offsets finds its
population with a regex of the shape `const NAME: usize = (0x[0-9a-fA-F_]+)`. That regex answers
"does the initialiser BEGIN with a hex literal", and two separate audits on 2026-08-31 hit the same
wall from opposite ends because it is not the question either of them was asking:

  * ADDRESS SIDE. `ADD_DEFAULT_FILE_LOAD_PROCESS_RVA: usize = 0x142658c60 - 0x140000000` is a real
    `.text` function. The capture stops at the MINUEND, so the harvester recorded the absolute VA
    0x142658c60 -- 1.1 GB past the end of a 0x140000000-based image -- which matches nothing in an
    RVA-keyed map and lands in `missing`. The address is neither checked nor reported as unchecked.
  * OFFSET SIDE. `scripts/detect-struct-field-drift.py --inventory` files an initialiser it cannot
    read under `kind="expr"` with `resolved=None`, and every downstream census then skips the row
    for want of a number. 41 of 813 live game-struct-field offsets were in that state: excluded
    from the population without appearing in the unattributed ratchet either.

Both are the same defect: a constant whose value is an expression is INVISIBLE, and invisible reads
exactly like checked. On a version-migration branch that is the worst state a constant can be in.

WHAT THIS REFUSES, AND WHY REFUSAL IS THE POINT. The grammar below is deliberately small: integer
literals, `+ - * / % << >> & | ^`, parentheses, unary minus, `as <int>` casts, `size_of::<T>()` over
primitives, references to other constants, and enum variants. Anything else -- `offset_of!`, a block
expression, a function call, a `size_of` over a game type this cannot lay out, a name declared twice
with different values -- returns `None` WITH A REASON. The reason is the deliverable: a caller must
put those in a bucket it PRINTS. `fold()` never guesses and never half-reads, because a half-read is
what turned a subtrahend into an address.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SEE. Declarations under `#[cfg(test)]`, whether the attribute is on
a `mod` or directly on the item. `er-seamless-bugfixes` writes

    #[cfg(test)]
    pub(crate) const FREELIST_SHUTDOWN_ASSERT_RVA: usize =
        FREELIST_SHUTDOWN_ASSERT_FN_RVA + FREELIST_SHUTDOWN_ASSERT_WINDOW_OFFSET;

and its own doc comment says it is spelled as a SUM precisely so that the `= 0x...` scanner cannot
select it: the value 0xc57670 is 0x90 bytes INSIDE a live function, and a ledger row for it would
license MinHook to write five bytes into a function body. Teaching a tool to fold sums without
teaching it to skip `#[cfg(test)]` items would have converted that documented safety property into
a detour licence -- the folder making things worse than the regex it replaced.

    harvesters need a rule where they previously had an accident.

    THE ACCIDENT, AND WHY IT HAS TO BECOME A RULE. `select-needed-1170-rows.py` selects on a NAME
    substring, and "INTERVAL" contains "RVA" -- all 35 `*INTERVAL*` constants in this workspace pass
    the name test. They stayed out of the ledgers for one reason: the old regex demanded `= 0x...`
    and they are written in decimal. Folding removes that accident, so 30-odd tick counters would
    walk straight in, two of them valued 0x1000 -- which is where `.text` begins, so they pair
    cleanly against the function map and mean nothing. That is exactly how `FIRST_SECTION_RVA`
    earned a detour licence.

    So the harvester now admits on "every literal this expression read was written in HEX, and it
    read at least one". That is still a spelling test and this docstring says so rather than
    dressing it up -- but it is an EXPLICIT one, applied to the whole expression instead of its
