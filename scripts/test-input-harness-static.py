    """The virtual-key array is a field of `FD4::FD4PadDevice`, reached through padDevices.

    THIS ASSERTION USED TO PIN THE DEFECT, twice over. Until 2026-08-31 it required the padMaps
    TypeID tree-walk -- `CS_INGAME_PAD_TYPEID_RVAS`, `for target in targets`, and a write through
    the `CS::CSInGamePad_UserInput1` the walk returned. That object does not own the array. The
    only function that writes it (1.16.2 0x1426634a0, `mov byte [rcx+rdx*2+0x88],1`, bound
    `cmp eax,0x50` on id-1000) has exactly four call sites -- 0x140240e70, 0x140241130,
    0x140e321b0, 0x140e32470 -- and EVERY one of them computes `rcx` as
    `*(manager + 0x18 + dev*8)`, i.e. `FD4PadManager::padDevices[dev]`. `FD4PadManager::Init`
    fills that array with `HeapAlloc(0x3c0)` + `FD4PadDevice::FD4PadDevice` +
    `FD4PadDevice::vftable`; the CSInGamePad merely HOLDS the device at its own +0x10.

    The tree-walk was not merely useless. The CSInGamePad is `HeapAlloc(0x98)` = 152 bytes, so
    `0x88 + (id-1000)*2` leaves the object at id 1008 and every id above wrote past the end of a
    live game allocation. It never fired only because the TypeID needles are `.data` RVAs with no
    1.17 mapping, so the search matched nothing -- a reason it was never observed, not a reason it
    was safe.
