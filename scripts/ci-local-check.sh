# SELF-HEAL THE WORKTREE CASE INSTEAD OF MAKING EVERY AGENT DO IT BY HAND. `vendor/` is
# gitignored, so a `git worktree` checkout (an agent sandbox under `.claude/worktrees/`, a
# `.worktrees/` lab) starts without MinHook while the MAIN checkout it was created from already has
# it -- and this script runs from the pre-push hook, so the first thing a worktree ever learns is
# that its push is refused. The shared git dir names that main checkout exactly, so link its vendor
# tree in rather than re-cloning ~1MB of C per worktree. Fail closed and unchanged when the link
# cannot be established, because a missing MinHook still breaks the cross-compile below.

CI checks out MinHook with:
  git clone --depth 1 --branch v1.3.4 https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook.git vendor/minhook

A git worktree normally self-heals here by linking the main checkout's vendor directory; reaching
this message from one means that checkout has no MinHook either, so clone it there first.
