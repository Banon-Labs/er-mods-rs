"""Behavioral tests for the cupcake signal `last_assistant_idle_hold`.

The signal script scans the last-completed assistant turn of the session transcript and returns a
TAGGED marker:
  * IDLEHOLD:<phrase>  -- an unjustified idle/hold announcement while a background task runs
  * ""                 -- clean (no hold language, OR the hold is justified / accompanied by
                          substantive non-overlapping work / blocked on the user)

We drive it against crafted transcript JSONL under a temporary HOME so the script's
`~/.claude/projects/<cwd-key>/*.jsonl` discovery resolves to our fixture, then assert the tag.
