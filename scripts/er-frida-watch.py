"""Attach to Elden Ring once, then hot-reload the agent file on every edit.

# Why attach once and iterate on the file

Frida's intended workflow is a `.js` agent that is reloaded in place, not a fresh attach per
experiment (user directive 2026-09-08). Beyond convenience that is the safer shape here: every
attach/detach cycle installs and reverts trampolines under running game threads, and the one crash
this session landed shortly after a detach. Attaching once and editing the file removes those
cycles entirely.

This connects through the Wine-side `frida-server.exe` that `scripts/er-frida-up.py` starts inside
the game's own prefix. A plain Linux-side `frida.attach()` on this target still fails --
`NotSupportedError: bootstrapper crashed with signal 11`, re-measured 2026-09-08 on Frida 17.17.0 --
because it injects a Linux bootstrapper into a Windows process. The prefix-resident server has no
such mismatch.

    python3 scripts/er-frida-up.py                  # once, brings the server up
    uv run --with frida python3 scripts/er-frida-watch.py      # attaches and stays resident
    uv run --with frida python3 scripts/er-frida-watch.py --selftest

Every message the agent sends is appended to the log as JSON, one per line, so the transcript
survives the watcher and can be read while it is still running.

# What the exit writes down

When the watch ends -- a detach, an interrupt, a `SIGTERM` -- it records what the session did
through `scripts/er-frida-evidence.py`: the agent file, the pid, how many messages came back, how
long it ran. `.cupcake/policies/claude/no_rust_edit_without_frida_proof.rego` reads that record and
refuses a Rust edit under `crates/` without one, so this is where the right to write the code comes
from. The count is taken here, by the tool, for the obvious reason: evidence a caller can type is
not evidence.
