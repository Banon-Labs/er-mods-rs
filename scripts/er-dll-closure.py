"""Which ME3-loadable DLLs does this branch actually affect?

Answers the question a generated profile has to get right: given the changes on this
branch, which cdylibs must be loaded for the run to be testing them -- and is that set
safe to load together?

The diff base is `origin/main`, always, and always the working tree
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacked branches are the norm here, and a PR near the tip of a stack has a tiny diff
against its immediate parent while the *stack* changes a great deal. Runtime-testing the
tip means testing everything below it, so the base is `merge-base(origin/main, HEAD)` --
never local `main` (which drifts) and never the parent branch.

The far end of the diff is the working tree, not `HEAD`. Cargo compiles what is on disk:
uncommitted edits and new untracked files are in the DLL whether or not they are committed.
Diffing to `HEAD` would omit the crate whose code is genuinely loaded, which is the one
failure this tool cannot afford.

Why a closure and not just the touched crate
--------------------------------------------
`er-game-base` is a path dependency of 26 crates and `er-hook` of 15. Editing either
changes the code inside DLLs whose own directories were never touched, so "the crates you
edited" systematically under-reports. The walk is therefore over reverse dependencies.

That same fan-out is why the conflict table exists: a wide closure will happily propose
loading the product next to `er_loading_portrait.dll`, which is documented in-tree as
a double-Present-hook corruption.

Why conflicts are resolved loudly rather than refused outright
--------------------------------------------------------------
The first cut of this script refused on any conflicting pair. Measuring it against the real
graph killed that: a change to `er-game-base` closes over all 16 shells and hits all five
conflicts, and `er-hook` closes over 12 and hits the same five. A tool that refuses on the
two most-edited shared crates is a tool nobody can use.

The danger was never the dropping -- it was dropping *silently*, which means launching while
believing you are testing a DLL that is not loaded. So a conflict against the product is
resolved in the product's favour and the exclusion is carried everywhere the run is
described: this output, the profile header, the running block, and the run state. An
excluded DLL is a stated non-result, not an omission.

Default-on shells, and why the diff is not the only input
--------------------------------------------------------
Selecting on the diff answers "what is this run testing". It does not answer "what does the
player expect to be playing", and the two came apart on 2026-09-08: `er-quickload` has no
reverse dependents, so a branch editing only the product closes over exactly one shell and
every gameplay companion leaves the profile without a word. The `[always]` table in the
conflict file is the standing half of `--with` -- packages unioned into every closure after
the diff has been walked. They are not pinned, so conflict ranking still drops them, and
`--without` still removes them; what they skip is having to be named on the command line.

Two cases still refuse outright, because neither can be resolved without guessing:
  * a conflict between two non-product DLLs -- nothing ranks them;
  * a DLL named explicitly with `--with` that a conflict would exclude -- an explicit
    request must never be quietly overridden, and must never corrupt the process either.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/er-dll-closure.py                 # human-readable
    python3 scripts/er-dll-closure.py --json          # machine-readable
    python3 scripts/er-dll-closure.py --no-fetch      # skip the origin refresh
    python3 scripts/er-dll-closure.py --selftest

Exit status: 0 sound, 1 hard error (bad base, git failure), 2 conflicting closure.
