"""Behavioral tests for the cupcake signal `last_assistant_wall_of_text`.

The signal scans the last assistant turn that actually said something and returns:
  * WALLOFTEXT:<n>:<opener>  -- the turn's longest CONTIGUOUS run of prose was n > 1 paragraphs;
  * ""                       -- clean.

Three properties matter and each has a wrong answer that already shipped:

  * WHICH TURN. The consumer is UserPromptSubmit, where the new prompt may already be on disk. Taking
    `turns[-1]` there reads an EMPTY turn and the guard silently never fires -- so the signal must
    pick the last turn with text, and this file drives both orderings.
  * WHAT UNIT. The longest contiguous run, not the turn's prose summed. A tool-heavy turn emits a
    one-line preamble before each call; summing eleven of those scored the turn as an eleven-paragraph
    wall and halted ordinary work.
  * WHAT IT SAYS. The tag has to carry the count and the opener, because the correction quotes them
    back. A correction that cannot name what it measured is a generic nag, and generic nags are what
    this guard already tried and lost with.

We drive the real signal against crafted transcript JSONL under a temporary HOME so its
`~/.claude/projects/<cwd-key>/*.jsonl` discovery resolves to our fixture, then assert the tag.
