"""Extract save-flow runtime evidence from an Elden Ring run, and score save integrity.

Answers the three questions a save-flow run exists to answer, in order of how badly each
matters:

  1. Did the live save CHANGE? Suppression's whole claim is that no save byte is written
     unless the Save Game row armed the one-shot bypass. A sha256 comparison against a
     pre-run snapshot is the only honest way to score that -- an mtime is not evidence,
     because the native writer patches blocks in place and a same-size same-mtime file can
     still differ.
  2. What did the DLL SAY it did? The `save-suppress:` / `save-flow:` / `save-dest:` lines
     appended by THIS run (seeked past a pre-run byte offset, so an old log cannot be
     mistaken for fresh evidence).
  3. What do the RAM oracles report? The `oracle_save_*` fields are the run-stopping
     detectors; the log is corroboration.

Deliberately NOT a pass/fail gate on the log text. A missing log line is a missing
observation, not a proven absence -- so the save-integrity sha is reported separately and
never inferred from what the log happens to contain.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/save-flow-run-evidence.py [--baseline DIR]

Environment overrides (all optional; defaults suit a Steam+Proton layout under $HOME):
    ER_GAME_DIR        directory holding er-quickload-*.log / er-quickload-telemetry.json
    ER_SAVE_DIR        directory holding ER0000.sl2
    ER_STEAM_ROOT      Steam root used to derive the two above (default $HOME/.local/share/Steam)
    ER_RUN_BASELINE    directory holding pre-run-sizes.json + pre-run-save-sha.txt

Write the baseline BEFORE the run with --snapshot.
