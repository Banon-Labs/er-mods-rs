# Menu-drive test: arm own_stepper without own_load, so own_stepper_idx10 takes the PHASE_MENU
# menu-drive path (SetState(3=BeginTitle) zero-input main-menu build -> identify Load-Game leaf ->
# stage 2 invoke the native Load-Game entry) instead of the bare-title own_load_drive deserialize that
# overflows the Scaleform MenuWindowJob+0x50 sequence (~20s crash). This validates the RE fix direction
# (route the load through the settled load-menu state, not the bare title). Input is auto-blocked (the
# always-block change blocks whenever own_stepper is armed) so the run is uncontaminable. Save-safe:
# the menu-drive currently does not SetState5 (no save write) -- it drives to the Load-Game state and the
# native async job mounts c30; this run shows how far it gets (reaches Load-Game / mounts c30 / crash).
