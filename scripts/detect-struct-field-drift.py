"""Measure ELDEN RING 1.16.2 -> 1.17 STRUCT FIELD OFFSET drift from the two images.

THE BLIND SPOT THIS CLOSES
--------------------------
`er-game-base` now refuses any game ADDRESS that has no verified 1.17 mapping, so a moved
function announces itself in the log. There is no equivalent protection for a struct FIELD
OFFSET. `PlayerGameData` grew 8 bytes in 1.17 -- `GetScadutreeBlessing` is byte-identical
between the builds EXCEPT `[rcx+0xab5]` -> `[rcx+0xabd]` -- and a constant like
`GAME_MAN_SAVED_MAP_C30_OFFSET` carrying a 1.16.2 value into a 1.17 object produces no
refusal, no crash and no log line. It silently reads, or writes, the wrong member.

HOW IT IS MEASURED (not guessed)
--------------------------------
A field offset is used by INSTRUCTIONS. So take a function whose 1.16.2 -> 1.17 identity is
already established (`docs/recon/rva-map-1162-to-1170.functions.tsv`, ~128k pairs; the
hand-verified subset is in `...verified.tsv`), decode both bodies, and keep only the pairs
that are instruction-for-instruction identical EXCEPT for memory displacements on a register
base. In such a pair the code did not change, so every displacement that DID change is a
field that moved, and by exactly how much. That set is the struct drift, measured.

`scripts/map-rvas-1162-to-1170.py::build_masked_pattern` masks precisely these bytes so its
signatures survive the drift. This tool is the inverse: it keeps what that one discards.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT COUNTED AS STRUCT DRIFT
-----------------------------------------------
* `[rip + disp]`   -- code and data moved; the displacement changing says nothing about a struct.
* branch/call targets -- same reason.
* `[rsp + disp]` and `[rbp - disp]` frame slots -- a stack frame is not a game structure. These
  are reported under their own `stack` class so a reader can see them and not mistake them for
  fields.
* absolute `[0x1400...]` operands -- data addresses, not fields.
* immediates -- `add rcx, 0xab5` really can carry a field offset, but an immediate is far more
  often a size, an id or a flag mask, so immediate changes go in a SEPARATE, explicitly
  lower-confidence table and any function containing one is downgraded to MIXED.

WHAT A RESULT MEANS
-------------------
A row here says: in N functions that are otherwise identical between the builds, displacement
`old` became `new`. That is strong evidence the field at `old` in SOME structure moved. It is
NOT evidence about a particular repo constant, because the same number is a field offset in
many unrelated structures. So the cross-reference (`--report`) always prints BOTH sides: how
often that value was seen drifting and how often it was seen unchanged, plus named example
functions, and it refuses to convert either into a verdict on its own. A missing offset costs a
lookup; a wrong one writes.

USAGE
    --selftest                     assert the parser, the classifier and a known 1.17 field move
    --inventory                    part 1: count and classify every *_OFFSET constant
    --scan                         part 2: measure drift across every mapped pair   (~1 min)
    --attribute                    ask Ghidra which TYPE each drifting function operates on
    --regions [--min-fields N]     cluster the raw rows into candidate structures
    --report [--autoload-only]     cross-reference the inventory against the measurement
    --explain 0xc30                everything measured about one displacement
    --find-displacement 0xc30 --names 8
                                   the decisive per-constant check: every mapped function that
                                   reads at that offset, and what happened to each   (~1 min)
    --pairs docs/recon/rva-map-1162-to-1170.verified.tsv --names 1
                                   compare only the functions this mod actually hooks
    --check-extents                prove the DECODED leaf extents against two independent
                                   witnesses: the linker's own `.pdata` table and Ghidra 1.16.2

ORDER: --scan, then --attribute (needs `bash scripts/ghidra/mcp-up-1162.sh`), then --report.
`--scan` and `--find-displacement` decode ~29 MB of function bodies on each side; background them.
Everything else reads cached output under `--out-dir`.

WHERE A FUNCTION ENDS IS PART OF THE MEASUREMENT
-----------------------------------------------
MSVC emits no unwind record for a leaf or a thunk, so `.pdata` cannot say where those end -- and
they are exactly the shape a field getter takes. Their extent is DECODED (forward-branch
watermark; the implementation is shared with `scripts/verify-rva-map-1170.py` rather than written
twice), never guessed at the next `.pdata` start. Guessing ran each such comparison through the
inter-function padding -- 0xCC in one build, 0x90 in the other -- and into unrelated neighbours,
which desynchronises the two decodes and reports the function as CHANGED. On 2026-08-30 that
produced six false "this hooked function changed in 1.17" verdicts, `SetSaveSlot` among them.
`--check-extents` is the standing proof; `--selftest` pins the shape.

THE ONE RULE FOR READING THE OUTPUT: a displacement is not a field. `0xb0c` moved in 1.17 -- in
`MoWwiseManImp`. `DIALOG_SLOT_CURSOR_B0C_OFFSET` is also `0xb0c` and indexes something else
entirely, and is unaffected. Never act on a number without the structure beside it.

    That is not merely too much text. The padding is the poison: MSVC pads with EITHER `int3`

    `compare_bodies` refuses a function whose instruction sequence differs, and it is right to:
    once the two streams are out of step, position N on one side is not position N on the other,
    and every displacement "difference" after that point is an artifact. But refusing leaves the
    most dangerous functions in the migration -- the ones that actually changed -- with UNKNOWN
    offsets and nothing more to say. `STEP_MoveMap` is squarely on the autoload path and gained
    two instructions in 1.17; "unknown" is the honest verdict and a useless one.

    So align them properly instead of pretending they are aligned. `difflib.SequenceMatcher` over
    the NORMALISED instruction shapes (mnemonic + register operand form, displacements dropped --
    the same normalisation the matcher masks with) finds the equal runs; inside an equal run the
    two instructions ARE the same instruction, so their displacements can be compared exactly as
    in an identical function. The inserted/deleted regions are reported as such and no offset is
    claimed from them.

    What this cannot do is tell you a field moved when the code around it was rewritten; it tells
    you what the surviving code says. That is strictly more than nothing, and it is honest about

    THE ARGUMENT. A structure grows by INSERTION: every field at or above the insertion point
    shifts, everything below it stays. So if one function, through one base register, still reads
    some field BELOW `offset` at the same displacement in 1.17, and some field ABOVE it at the
    same displacement too, then no insertion happened anywhere between those two -- and `offset`
    lies between them. The field is proven not to have moved by fields that are not it.

    This is what settles the offsets that have no witness of their own, which is most of the
    interesting ones: `GameMan+0xbc9` is read by nothing in the mapped half, but the `GameMan`
    constructor holds 139 displacements from `0x20` to `0xe70` on `rsi` with nothing moving, and
    `0xbc8` and `0xbcc` sit either side of it.

    The base register is what keeps this honest. One function walks several objects, and a held
    offset on `rax` says nothing about a field reached through `rbx`.

    NOT A VERDICT ON ITS OWN, and this is the third time this file has had to learn it. Run over
    all 430 hooked pairs the bracket fires for every one of the 48 unresolved constants, because
    some function somewhere holds a field either side of any small number -- the same coincidence
    that made the offset-only join worthless, wearing a span instead of a point. A bracket only
    argues about the object the function was handed, so the caller must say WHICH function is the

    """Adjudicate the constants `--report` leaves as UNKNOWN-STRUCT, worst blast radius first.

    WHY THESE ARE NOT SIMPLY UNRESOLVABLE. `--report` refuses to judge a constant whose STRUCTURE
    it cannot name, because joining on the offset alone is worthless -- `0xb0c` moved in
    `MoWwiseManImp` while `DIALOG_SLOT_CURSOR_B0C_OFFSET` is a different object at the same
    number. That refusal is right when a number was seen MOVING somewhere: then the structure is
    the only thing that separates a hit from a coincidence.

    It is not right when a number was never seen moving ANYWHERE. The scan is exhaustive over the
    mapped half of the image, so "this displacement changed in 0 of the N otherwise-identical
    function pairs that use it, and held still in M instructions" is a statement about every
    structure the scan can see, ours included. Naming the structure adds nothing to it. That
    asymmetry is what lets most of the 553 be settled without a Ghidra type, and it is the whole
    idea of this mode.

    So each constant lands in one of:
      NOT-MOVED-ANYWHERE  held M times, moved 0 times      -> cleared, structure-independently
      MOVED-SOMEWHERE     moved somewhere                  -> needs the witness read (--names)
      NO-EVIDENCE         held 0, moved 0                  -> stays UNKNOWN, honestly

    NO-EVIDENCE is the honest answer, not a failure. `0xab5` -- the one offset this migration
    already knows moved -- lands there, because its only witness is a `.pdata`-less leaf that the
    function map does not contain.
