"""Route every read of a game global through the build gate, mechanically.

A stale CALL announces itself -- 1.16.2's `0x1405eefb0` is mid-instruction on 1.17 and the
process dies on the spot. A stale READ does not. Every `.data` global moved between the
builds, so `safe_read_usize(base + FOO_RVA)` SUCCEEDS on 1.17 and returns whatever now
occupies the old slot. Two of those were measured: a garbage repository pointer that made
`CreateTpfResCap` divide by zero 894ms into boot, and a stale swapchain root that left a
live process behind a black screen for twenty seconds.

There were 73 such reads, and unlike call sites they need no per-site decision: they are
already fault-tolerant and already have a "this global is not there" branch.
`game_data_addr` returns 0 on refusal, the read fails, and the existing branch runs. So the
rewrite is uniform and this script does it.

It deliberately does NOT touch call sites. Zero is a safe address to fail a read at and a
fatal one to jump to; a `transmute` needs its author to say what refusing means.

WHAT IT COULD NOT SEE UNTIL 2026-08-30, and why "0 sites" was not the same as "none left"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`check-stale-rva-calls.py` -- the gate that COUNTS what this tool CONVERTS -- was widened
three times that day, each time because a real ungated read had been standing in a spelling
its regex did not admit. This sweeper was never widened with it, so the two diverged: the
gate could see a site and the sweeper could not rewrite it, while the sweeper's own summary
line said `would rewrite 0 read site(s)` -- which reads as "there is nothing left to do".
Measured on this tree the same day: the widened pattern finds EIGHT reads the narrow one
misses, in six crates. The narrow shape demanded, and the widening dropped:

  A NAME.        `[A-Z0-9_]*RVA[A-Z0-9_]*` required the constant to be spelled `*RVA*`. What
                 makes a read stale is the ARITHMETIC -- a module base plus a compile-time
                 constant -- and the arithmetic does not care what the constant is called.
                 All eight sites this now sees are named `PE_*_LFANEW_OFFSET`, and see the
                 value gate below for why they are then EXCLUDED rather than rewritten.
  A LITERAL BASE `own_stepper_idx10_fallbacks!` hands the module base to its body as a macro
                 metavariable, so every read inside reads `$base + FOO_RVA`. One `$` hid a
                 live 1.17 defect from the sibling gate.
  NO QUALIFIER.  `jp::GAME_MAN_GLOBAL_RVA` and `ProfileLoadMenuRva::Slot as usize` are both
                 `base + <constant>`; neither is a bare SCREAMING_SNAKE token.

AND IT READ PROSE. The old matcher ran over RAW file text, so a `//` paragraph or a `///`
doc comment quoting `safe_read_usize(base + FOO_RVA)` was a rewrite target -- this tool
EDITS, so a false positive here does not merely inflate a count, it rewrites an English
sentence into code that describes nothing. `gate-stale-rva-calls.py`, its sibling, was
measured doing exactly that on 2026-08-30 (two hits, both comments, one of them inside the
paragraph explaining the hazard). Comments and string bodies are now blanked -- through the
SHARED `rva_symbols.code_only`, so there is one dialect rather than a fourth -- and the
rewrite is spliced into the original text at the offsets that reader reports, which it can
do because the blanking preserves offsets exactly.

THE VALUE GATE, and why widening without it would have CORRUPTED six crates
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dropping the name filter admits `safe_read_u32(base + PE_DOS_LFANEW_OFFSET)`: the DOS
header's `0x3c` field, read to find the NT header. That is `base + constant` arithmetic and
it does match. It is also not an address the game map knows: routing it through
`game_data_addr` gets a REFUSAL, `game_data_addr` returns 0, and the crash logger's PE walk
reads offset 0x3c of nothing. Eight sites across six crates, every one of them a working PE
header read, and the widened pattern hits all eight.

So the exclusion is by VALUE -- below `.text`'s 0x1000, therefore fixed by the PE format and
unable to move between builds -- and never by name, which is the same discipline
`check-stale-rva-calls.py` applies to the same eight constants. A constant whose value cannot
be resolved is REWRITTEN rather than skipped, because a read is fault-tolerant by
construction: the failure mode of gating one that did not need it is a refusal, and the
failure mode of skipping one that did is the silent wrong pointer this tool exists to remove.
