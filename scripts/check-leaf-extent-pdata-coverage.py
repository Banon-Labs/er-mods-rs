"""No `IDENTICAL-LEAF` row may sit INSIDE a function the image already declares.

WHAT THIS GUARDS, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE CHECK ALREADY IN THE VERIFIER.
`IDENTICAL-LEAF` is the one verdict that issues its own detour licence: a leaf has no `.pdata`
entry, so it reaches `DETOURABLE_ENTRY_EVIDENCE` in `crates/er-game-base/build.rs` through the
`NEITHER-ENTRY` clause, which makes no claim about the entry at all. Everything that keeps that
safe rests on one premise -- that the address really is a whole function the linker chose not to
describe, rather than a point in the MIDDLE of one it did.

`add_leaf_extents` in `scripts/verify-rva-map-1170.py` tests a WEAKER premise than the one the
verdict rests on. It skips a VA when `rva in extents`, i.e. when a `.pdata` entry BEGINS there.
An address 0x10 bytes into a declared function begins nothing, so it is not in `extents`, so a
leaf extent gets decoded for it, so it can reach `IDENTICAL-LEAF` and carry a detour into the
middle of a function. That is the precise shape of the failure the 1.17 migration keeps paying
for: a confident WRONG address reads as a live value and corrupts silently, where a missing one
merely turns a feature off.

MEASURED 2026-08-30: zero rows in any current map are affected -- every derived extent belongs to
an address no `.pdata` entry covers in either image. So this is a latent hole, not a live bug, and
this file exists to keep it that way. Coverage is computed over the RAW `.pdata` table including
`UNW_FLAG_CHAININFO` continuation chunks, because a continuation is still the interior of a
function even though `function_regions` deliberately drops it as a function START.

USAGE
    uv run --with capstone python3 scripts/check-leaf-extent-pdata-coverage.py
    uv run --with capstone python3 scripts/check-leaf-extent-pdata-coverage.py --verbose

Exits non-zero when a derived leaf extent, or a written `IDENTICAL-LEAF` row, lands inside a
declared function region in either image.
