"""The 1.16.2 -> 1.17 verdict admission rules, and the emptiness assertion that keeps a gate honest.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
`crates/er-game-base/build.rs` decides which rows of a `verify-rva-map-1170.py` verdict table are
good enough to CALL and to DETOUR. Several audits under `scripts/` reproduce that decision so they
can report on it. Every one of them that TRANSCRIBED the rules instead of reading them has since
been wrong:

  * the verdict vocabulary grew from a bare `IDENTICAL` to `BYTE-IDENTICAL` / `IDENTICAL-WHOLE` /
    `IDENTICAL-LEAF` / `IDENTICAL-SHORT` / `IDENTICAL-PREFIX`. A gate still comparing against the
    literal `"IDENTICAL"` now matches NOTHING, and `docs/recon/rva-map-1162-to-1170.verified.tsv`
    contains that exact string ZERO times out of 101 rows;
  * one such transcription reported the DETOUR table as 42 rows instead of 374;
  * `select-needed-1170-rows.py::verified_rvas` returned the EMPTY SET for the whole of 2026-08-30,
    so its documented "the verified map wins wherever both cover an address" rule was not applied
    at all.

VACUOUS QUANTIFICATION, which is the class all of those belong to
----------------------------------------------------------------
"No element of S has property P" is TRIVIALLY TRUE when S is empty. A gate that filters rows and
then asserts something about what survived cannot, on its own, tell "checked 800 rows, all fine"
apart from "checked zero rows". Both exit 0. Both print a green tick. Only one of them looked.

So a gate here does two things it did not do before:

  1. it RE-DERIVES the vocabulary (`rules()` below) rather than spelling it out, so a rename in
     build.rs moves the gate with it instead of silently emptying it; and
  2. it asserts the filtered set is NON-EMPTY, and non-trivially so, BEFORE asserting anything
     about its contents (`nonempty`, `admit_rows`). A gate that legitimately has nothing to check
     must SAY SO LOUDLY -- an empty scope is a finding about the audit, not a pass.

THE ONE PARSER
--------------
`rules()` does not parse `build.rs` itself. It calls `check-1170-translation-collisions.py`'s
`build_rules()`, which already does it properly -- reading the ledger paths, the instruction floor,
`EXHAUSTIVE_VERDICTS`, `DETOURABLE_ENTRY_EVIDENCE`, the field indices, and (the part every stale
gate got wrong) the PREFIX verdict out of `detourable_pairs`'s match arm, where it is spelled as a
bare literal rather than a constant. Adding a SECOND parser here would recreate the duplication
this module exists to delete. If that file is missing or its parse of build.rs fails, `rules()`
RAISES: four gates going red together because the rules can no longer be read is correct, and is
strictly better than four gates quietly auditing an empty set.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/rva_admission.py            # print the rules as read today
    python3 scripts/rva_admission.py --selftest # negative control: a filter that matches nothing
                                                # must go RED, not green
