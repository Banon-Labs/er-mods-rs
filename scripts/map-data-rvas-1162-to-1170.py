"""Carry a 1.16.2 DATA address (a global, a vtable, a table) onto 1.17.

WHY THE FUNCTION MAP CANNOT DO THIS
-----------------------------------
`build-1162-1170-function-map.py` pairs functions, and it works because a
function has content to compare. A global has no content: at rest it is eight
zero bytes like every other global, so nothing about the datum itself says
which one it is.

And they DID move. Every `.data` global in the sibling's RVA bundle shifted
between 2.6.2.0 and 2.7.0.0 -- most by +0x4070, `runtime_heap_allocator` by
+0x4080, `multiplay_properties` by +0x4000, and `cs_system_step` BACKWARDS by
-0x17408. So a constant delta is not merely unproven, it is wrong, and the one
that breaks it is not an outlier anybody would have guessed.

Reading a stale global is quiet and then fatal. `GLOBAL_TEX_REPOSITORY_RVA`
went unread-and-unnoticed into `CreateTpfResCap`, which divided by zero at
`eldenring.exe+0x26537d0` and took the game down 894ms after load on
2026-08-29 -- with a perfectly correct, freshly translated function address
sitting one frame up, which is what made it look like the translation's fault.

HOW THIS WORKS INSTEAD
----------------------
A global has no content, but the CODE THAT USES IT does. So: find every
instruction in 1.16.2 `.text` that references the address rip-relatively, map
each of those functions onto 1.17 with the function map, decode the instruction
at the same position in the 1.17 function, and read where ITS displacement
points. Every reference casts a vote.

Agreement across independent call sites is the evidence. A single unopposed
vote is reported as WEAK rather than silently promoted, because one reference
inside a function that happens to have been edited is exactly how a confident
wrong address gets produced.

Calibrated against the eleven `.data` fields whose 1.16.2 and 1.17 values are
both known from the sibling's own generator -- including `cs_system_step`,
whose backwards move any delta-based method gets wrong.

# `refresh()` rewrites the data map WHOLESALE. A row it does not reproduce is either a STRAY, which
# stops the write, or RETIRED, which is dropped -- and "retired" was decided by asking whether the
# `CONST`/`ALIAS` scan below still produced the address. That scan is name-filtered (`*RVA*`),
# typed (`usize|u32|u64`), and knows exactly two shapes; it has no bare `rva: 0x..` table-field
# form and no `pub use .. as ..` form. An address written in any spelling it does not know was
# classed `retired (nothing declares 0x%x any more)` and deleted from a tracked ledger at exit 0.
#
# What that costs: the row's absence afterwards reads as an address that was never mapped, not as
# one that was deleted, and the code holding that address then reads a 1.16.2 value on 1.17 with no
# refusal line and no fault. This file's own header calls that failure "quiet and then fatal".

    load-bearing. `WORLD_NVM_MANAGER_GLOBAL_RVA 0x3d75870` really does move +0x4078 -- measured
    here at 323 of 327 of its own references, a third independent agreement with the ledger's

    bytes below (0x3d75879, 0x3d7587a) move +0x4062. Anything that "smoothed" it toward its

    An anchor counts only when its references agree unanimously AND there are at least two of them

    +0x4062, claim +0x4078), so it continues to reject exactly the discontinuity it exists to
