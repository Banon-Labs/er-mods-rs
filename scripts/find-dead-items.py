"""Report every item defined under a directory whose identifier has no consumer anywhere.

Companion to `scripts/find-identifier.py`. Written for the `startup_hooks/` dead-code sweep:
it enumerates `fn` / `const` / `static` / `struct` / `enum` / `type` / `trait` definitions under a
target directory and counts whole-word occurrences of each identifier across the repo, EXCLUDING
the definition line itself.

Zero remaining occurrences => no caller anywhere, including through a `pub(crate) use ...::*`
glob re-export (the search is on the bare identifier, never a qualified path, which is exactly
the case a `module::symbol` search misses).

# Why this tool was wrong until 2026-08-30

The corpus used to be four globs of Rust source::

    ("crates/**/*.rs", "tools/**/*.rs", "src/**/*.rs", "build.rs")

Every consumer that is not a Rust file inside the cargo build graph was therefore invisible, and
an identifier consumed only by one of them was reported ``DEAD`` -- a wrong answer handed
straight to `scripts/delete-rust-items.py`, which used to delete on that advice with no proof of
its own. Real consumer classes this repo has, all of which were being missed:

* the RVA ledgers -- ``docs/recon/rva-map-1162-to-1170.{needed,data,verified}.tsv`` carry Rust
  constant names in a column (e.g. ``RESMGR_EXPECTED_VTABLE_RVA``);
* ``scripts/*.py`` -- 359 of them, many naming Rust constants (e.g.
  ``SCALEFORM_MEMORY_FILE_REFCOUNT_OFFSET`` in ``adjudicate-autoload-offsets.py``);
* ``build-support/**/*.rs`` -- ``prologue_build.rs`` is 641 lines ``include!``d by crate build
  scripts, and matched none of the four globs;
* ``Cargo.toml`` prose and feature comments (e.g. ``wgpu_layout``);
* ``docs/**/*.md`` design notes (e.g. ``RENDER_FRAME_COUNT``).

Two corrections to folklore about the old globs, both verified rather than assumed:

* ``crates/**/*.rs`` DOES already cover the seven crate-level ``crates/*/build.rs`` files --
  Python's ``**`` matches zero or more path segments, so ``crates/er-hook/build.rs`` matches.
  They were never missing. What WAS missing is ``build-support/``.
* the bare ``build.rs`` glob entry matched nothing at all: this repo has no repo-root ``build.rs``.

# Verdicts

Consumers are now classified by WHERE they live, and the three no-build-graph-consumer outcomes
print distinctly, because "nobody anywhere names this" and "only a Python script names this" are
different facts and must not share a line:

    ALIVE            >=1 consumer inside the cargo build graph. Not printed (as before).
    ALIVE-ELSEWHERE  0 build-graph consumers, >=1 consumer in a ledger/script/doc/manifest.
    MIRROR-ONLY      consumers only in a mirror tree (`.worktrees/`, `target/`, ...); needs
                     --include-mirrors to be reachable at all. Almost always the item's own
                     duplicate definition in a stale checkout, not a consumer.
    DEAD             zero consumers in every scanned corpus.

Only ``DEAD`` is a deletion candidate. `scripts/delete-rust-items.py` refuses anything else.

A ``DEAD`` here is still necessary but NOT sufficient to delete: a `match` arm or any other
runtime-unreachable branch inside a live function still emits machine code, and removing it
changes the shipped `.text`. Confirm the deletion with `scripts/dll-code-fingerprint.py`.

# Mirror trees are opt-in, deliberately

``.worktrees/`` holds ~48,800 `.rs` files totalling ~1.06 GB -- whole copies of this repo at other
commits -- and a "hit" there is overwhelmingly the item's OWN definition in a stale copy rather
than a consumer. Measured on `crates/` (2026-08-30):

    default            corpus  1,713 files,  1.2 s,  DEAD=1941  ALIVE-ELSEWHERE=71
    --include-mirrors  corpus 58,274 files, 48.0 s,  DEAD=  41  ALIVE-ELSEWHERE=71  MIRROR-ONLY=1900

Scanning them turns 1,900 of 1,941 findings into MIRROR-ONLY for 40x the runtime. That is not a
safer tool, it is a tool with no output. So it is behind ``--include-mirrors``, and when it is
on, those findings get their own ``MIRROR-ONLY`` verdict rather than being laundered into
``ALIVE-ELSEWHERE``. Deleting an item from the tracked tree does not break a worktree anyway --
a worktree is a separate checkout with its own copy.

    python3 scripts/find-dead-items.py <dir-or-file> [<dir-or-file> ...]
