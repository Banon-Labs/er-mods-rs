"""Every way a cdylib can reach an ELDEN RING game address WITHOUT the 1.17 version gate.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Two crates were caught bypassing the gate on 2026-08-30 in two different ways, and BOTH were
invisible to the audits that were already running -- which reported zero:

  * `er-seamless-bugfixes` byte-checked a target prologue at a raw `base + guard.rva` BEFORE
    anything translated it. The gate existed downstream and never ran, so on 1.17 the check
    compared unrelated code, logged "byte mismatch", and installed 0/3 guards. An ORDERING bug.
  * `er-reload-trace` imported the RAW `er_hook::MH_CreateHook` / `MH_EnableHook` externs, so
    `MhHook::new`'s gate was simply not on the path. 19 five-byte JMPs went into the middle of
    live instructions. The log said `installed` 34 times and refused nothing.

Both escaped for the SAME reason: the existing regexes assumed a SPELLING.
`HAND_BUILT` required an uppercase `RVA` identifier, so `base + spec.rva` matched 0 of 40 sites;
`RAW_WRITE` matched only named-pointer stores, so 6 cast-and-assign writes read as zero. This
script therefore keys on the SHAPE of the dataflow -- an address expression that reaches a use --
never on a naming convention, and every class carries a positive control in `--selftest`.

THE GATE
--------
`er_game_base` is the only thing that knows where a 1.16.2 address lives on the running build:

    game_rva / game_rva_named        -> Result<usize>   (call targets)
    game_data_addr                   -> usize, 0 on refusal (reads)
    read_global_ptr / read_global_u8 -> resolve + fault-safe read
    write_global_u8                  -> resolve + store, refuses rather than corrupting
    resolve_game_address(_fmt)       -> Option<usize>   (the primitive)
    resolve_detour_address           -> Option<usize>   (the stricter detour licence)

Anything else that turns a module base plus an offset into an address a CALL, a DETOUR, a READ,
a WRITE or a COMPARE consumes is a bypass.

CLASSES
-------
  RAW_MINHOOK        MinHook externs called outside `er-hook`; `MhHook::new`'s gate is not on
                     the path at all.
  UNGATED_ARITH      `base + X` / `.add(X)` / `.wrapping_add(X)` on a module base, not lexically
                     inside a gate call.
  PRE_GATE_CHECK     a byte / prologue / signature comparison performed on an UNGATED address --
                     the seamless-bugfixes ordering class. Reported even when a gate runs later,
                     because the CHECK already read the wrong bytes.
  CACHED_ADDR        an ungated address stored into a `static` / `OnceLock` / atomic / field and
                     used later, where no reader can see where it came from.
  CONST_FOLD         `0x140000000 + rva` folded at compile time; there is no runtime moment at
                     which a gate could run.
  FN_PTR_CAST        `transmute` / `as extern fn` on a computed address -- a CALL, the failure
                     mode with no unwind information.
  VTABLE_WRITE       a store into a vtable slot or function-pointer table. Touches no MinHook, so
                     no hook audit sees it.
  INDIRECT_HELPER    a local `fn(...) -> usize` that hides `base + rva` from every regex.
  DOUBLE_TRANSLATE   a runtime-DERIVED address (AOB scan, vtable read, trampoline, return
                     address) fed INTO the gate. Those are already 1.17; translating one again
                     moves a correct address to a wrong one.

#
# A `\$?` WAS PROPOSED HERE ON 2026-08-30 AND MEASURED TO BE A NO-OP -- recorded so nobody adds it

# and one such `$` really did hide a live 1.17 crash (`transmute($base +
# TITLE_TOP_DIALOG_IS_IN_STATE_RVA)`, a function that moved 0x749b20 -> 0x74a970) from
# `check-stale-rva-calls.py`. That gate anchored on `\(\s*` before the base, which the `$` blocks.
# THIS one anchors on `\b`, and there IS a word boundary between `$` and `b` -- so `\bbase\s*\+`
# already matches `transmute($base + FOO_RVA)`, at the `b`. One line proves it:

# pattern caught the macro body too -- which is what a vacuity check is for. Widening the identifier
# would have changed only where the match STARTS, never whether there is one.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- which DLLs does a finding ship in?
# Most of these crates are LIBRARIES. `er-title-flow` is not loaded by me3; it is linked into
# `er_quickload.dll`, and a bypass in it ships in the product. `er-build-import-runtime` is linked
# into FOUR cdylibs at once. Reporting a finding against the library it lives in, without saying
# which DLLs carry it, understates every one of them.
