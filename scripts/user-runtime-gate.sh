# Shared one-shot user gate for real Elden Ring runtime launches.

# A real launch must pass a per-run token file through ER_QUICKLOAD_USER_RUNTIME_GO_TOKEN.
# The token file must contain the exact current run identity (RUN_DIR preferred,
# else ARTIFACT_DIR, else ME3_PROFILE) and is consumed before the launch boundary.
# One user "go" authorizes one token for one run. A retry/relaunch needs a new
# user "go" and a new token. Dry-runs/help/preflight-only paths should not call it.

This requires a one-shot per-run token from the current user go:
  ER_QUICKLOAD_USER_RUNTIME_GO_TOKEN=<file containing this run's RUN_DIR/ARTIFACT_DIR/ME3_PROFILE>
The token is consumed before launch. Every retry/relaunch needs a fresh user go.

  # which reads as "the file is empty" and sends the next person hunting the wrong fault (observed
  # 2026-08-07). Keep what was read; an actually-empty file still fails the exact-match test below.
