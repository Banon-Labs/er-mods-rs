"""Unified diff of ONE file in an outside checkout against a commit in THIS repo.

Sibling of `compare-tree-to-commit.py`, for when the answer needed is not "did it change" but
"what changed" -- and, like it, it exists because a worktree-isolated agent cannot point git at
another checkout.

    python3 scripts/diff-tree-to-commit.py <commit> <other-checkout-root> <relative-path> [--headers]

`--headers` prints only the hunk headers, which is enough to judge whether two branches will
collide on rebase without reading somebody else's in-flight work line by line.
