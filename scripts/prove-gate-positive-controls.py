"""POSITIVE CONTROLS FOR THE GATES: does each check actually go RED on its own defect?

`scripts/audit-selftest-vacuity.py` answers a NEARBY question -- would the gate's own
selftest notice if its matcher went blind -- and that is a proxy. This answers the direct
one: plant the exact defect the gate claims to detect INTO THE REAL TREE, run the real
gate, and require a non-zero exit that NAMES the defect. Then plant a legitimate lookalike
and require the gate to stay green, because a gate that is red on everything is a gate
people learn to route around.

WHY IT IS NOT IN check.sh
-------------------------
Every control here MUTATES TRACKED FILES for the duration of one subprocess. That is safe
for one operator running it deliberately and NOT safe inside a suite other agents run
concurrently: a `git status` taken during a mutation window shows a defect nobody wrote,
and a concurrent writer to the same file would lose its edit to the restore. So this is a
manual instrument. `scripts/audit-selftest-vacuity.py --selftest` is the part that IS
cheap and side-effect-free enough to gate, and it is wired in check.sh.

RESTORATION IS NOT OPTIONAL, AND `finally` IS NOT ENOUGH
-------------------------------------------------------
SIGTERM -- how an agent harness reclaims a long-running process -- kills the interpreter
without unwinding. Measured on this tool's own first run: a `subprocess.run(..., timeout=600)`
mutant survived in `scripts/detect-proc.py` after a 45s harness timeout. Restoration is
therefore driven by a registry that atexit AND the fatal signal handlers both drain.

FOUR WAYS TO WRITE AN INVALID MUTANT (all four were hit while building this)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A mutant that does not actually contain the defect proves nothing about the gate:
  * `fn _pc_probe_dead_helper()` -- rustc's `dead_code` lint EXEMPTS `_`-prefixed names,
    so the "dead function" was never dead and check-save-disable-warnings was right to
    stay green.
  * renaming a required token `X` to `X + "X"` leaves `X` present as a PREFIX, so a
    substring gate correctly finds it.
  * `fn pcProbeUsedHelper` fails to COMPILE under `-D non-snake-case`, so the gate never
    ran; a mutant that breaks the build is not a positive control.
  * a forbidden launch URL written as a `#` COMMENT is deliberately skipped by
    check-launch-guardrails, which only scans executable lines.

    The defect is measured, not imagined: `bd hooks install` HONOURS an existing

    replaces the tracked pre-commit and pre-push, and every "is a hook installed" assertion
    stays green afterwards, because a hook is still there and still executable.

    WHY THIS ONE RUNS AGAINST AN ISOLATED ROOT rather than the live tree, unlike most
    controls here. The file under mutation would be the PUSH GATE ITSELF. Every other
    control's mutant is inert for the duration of one subprocess; this one would disarm the
    gate for every agent sharing this checkout during its window, and a concurrent push is
    exactly the event it exists to stop. `check-git-hooks-installed.sh <root>` takes the
    repository to inspect as an argument for this reason, so the real gate is still the
