"""Bring up a Wine-side Frida server in Elden Ring's own prefix, and prove it can see the game.

# Why the server, and not `frida.attach()`

A plain `frida.attach()` on this target injects a Linux bootstrapper into a Windows process and it
segfaults: `frida.NotSupportedError: bootstrapper crashed with signal 11 at offset 0x0`. Measured
again on 2026-09-08 with Frida 17.17.0, so that half of the old finding still holds. The other half
did not: the game survived both attempts (`scripts/er-frida-attach-probe.py` reports the pid alive
before and after), which is why the standing rule against ever touching Frida here was retired.

Running `frida-server.exe` -- the Windows build -- inside the game's own prefix removes the
mismatch entirely. The server is a Windows process talking to a Windows process, so no Linux-side
bootstrapper is ever injected, and the game is reached as an ordinary remote device. Proven
2026-09-08: the server enumerated 15 prefix processes, found `eldenring.exe`, attached, resolved
`ersc.dll` at `0x180000000`, and installed an `Interceptor` on `ersc+0x25850`.

# What this buys

Seamless's session object cannot be found by scanning: the game holds 25,192 objects that match its
static shape and no `ersc.dll` global points at it. Frida answers it in one hook, because
`ersc+0x25850` opens `mov rdi, [rcx + 0x58]` -- so `rcx` at entry is the menu object and `rdi` is
the session, handed over by the game rather than guessed at.

    python3 scripts/er-frida-up.py            # start it, or report the one already running
    uv run --with frida python3 scripts/er-frida-up.py --status   # needs frida in the interpreter
    python3 scripts/er-frida-up.py --stop
    python3 scripts/er-frida-up.py --selftest # no game required

Then, from any script:

    dev = frida.get_device_manager().add_remote_device("127.0.0.1:27042")
    session = dev.attach(dev.enumerate_processes.__self__ and PID)
