"""Audit the audits: is a gate's PASS provable, or merely asserted?

A gate that scans the tree with a regex and reports "0 findings" is only
trustworthy if something would go red when that regex stops matching. Three
audits in this repo reported zero while real findings existed (2026-08-30), each
because its core matcher knew exactly one spelling of a thing that has several.

This tool answers the question empirically instead of by reading code: it
re-runs each gate's own ``--selftest`` (or its companion ``test-*.py``) with the
``re`` module lobotomised so that EVERY pattern matches nothing, and records
whether the selftest noticed.

    exit 0 under a blind matcher  ->  ASSERTED (the selftest cannot see the
                                      matcher; a silent zero is indistinguishable
                                      from a clean tree)
    non-zero under a blind matcher -> PROVABLE (something is watching)

A SHELL gate has no ``re`` module to lobotomise, and every ``.sh`` in check.sh
was silently skipped here -- ``--only check-git-hooks-installed`` printed nothing
at all, which reads exactly like a gate that was judged and had no findings. Its
matchers are external programs instead, so the blinding is a PATH shim. Three
things a bash gate decides with, and the shim for each:

  * CONTENT COMPARATORS -- ``cmp``, ``diff``, ``grep`` -- forced to report
    SAMENESS/PRESENCE with no output.
  * DELEGATES -- ``cargo``, ``python3``, the programs a shell gate hands its
    verdict to -- run for real, output kept, EXIT STATUS forced to 0. Three of
    the nine shell gates in check.sh run no comparator at all and decide purely
    this way; all three used to come back NO-MATCHER-RUN, which is this tool
    failing to reach the matcher in a costume that reads like a finding.
  * THE SUBJECT of a ``test-<x>.sh`` harness -- ``<x>.sh`` itself -- replaced by
    an ``exit 0`` stub in a shadow root of symlinks. No PATH shim can reach a
    subject invoked by absolute path, and "would this harness notice its gate
    doing nothing?" is the sharper question anyway.

A shell selftest that still passes when nothing can ever differ is asserting, not
proving. Note the one asymmetry with the python blinding: a PATH shim is not
caller-aware, so it blinds the whole process tree rather than only callers under
``scripts/``.

    python3 scripts/audit-selftest-vacuity.py            # sweep check.sh's gates
