"""Generate a small, *readable* `.beads/PRIME.md` for `bd prime`.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY THE OBVIOUS FIX IS NOT ENOUGH
------------------------------------------------------
`bd prime` inlines every persistent memory BODY by default: 4.6 MB / ~650k tokens
at 2454 memories. The first fix here replaced that with a titles-only index, which
got it to 157 KB -- still far past what Claude Code will inline. The harness wrote
the whole thing to `tool-results/hook-<uuid>-stdout.txt` and showed the agent a
2 KB preview, so the priming content was effectively LOST while still costing a
large chunk of every session. It also fires on PreCompact, i.e. exactly when
context is scarcest.

Titles-only was the wrong axis. The memory index is not a document to be READ; it
is a search corpus, and `bd` already ships the search (`bd memories <keyword>`,
`bd recall <key>`). So this generator emits only what an agent CANNOT get on
demand:

  * the newest memories (recency -- no bd query orders by date),
  * a term histogram over the keys (which words are worth searching, with counts),
  * the top of the ready queue,
  * and the path to the full titles list, written beside PRIME.md.

Nothing rule-like is dropped: `bd prime`'s entire non-memory output is a 367-byte
header (measured -- `bd prime --export --full` carries no command reference in
this build), and every project rule lives in AGENTS.md, which CLAUDE.md imports.

The byte budget is enforced, not hoped for: `fit()` shrinks the optional sections
until the output fits BEADS_PRIME_MAX_BYTES, and `scripts/test-beads-prime-size.py`
drives this generator against a synthetic 6000-memory store in `scripts/check.sh`
so the regression cannot come back quietly.

Env knobs (all optional):
  BEADS_PRIME_MAX_BYTES   hard output cap (default 8192)
  BEADS_PRIME_RECENT      newest-memory lines (default 30)
  BEADS_PRIME_TERMS       search terms in the topic index (default 60)
  BEADS_PRIME_READY       ready-queue rows (default 8)
  BD_REAL_BIN             bd binary to use (also how the test injects a stub)
