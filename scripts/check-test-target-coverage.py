"""THE UNEXECUTED-TEST GATE. Fail when a crate declares `#[test]` functions that no gate
in this repo ever runs.

# The class this closes

`default-members = ["crates/er-quickload"]` means a bare `cargo test` selects ONE of the
workspace's 64 crates. Every other crate reaches a gate only by being named explicitly in
`scripts/check.sh`, `scripts/check-rust-build.sh` or `.github/workflows/check.yml` -- and
nothing checked that the naming was complete. Two instances were found on 2026-08-31, both
by accident, neither by a gate:

  * `er-save-suppress` did not COMPILE for the host at all (9 errors: a windows `cdylib`'s
    items read as dead on Linux, and `[workspace.lints.rust] warnings = "deny"` promotes
    that to a hard error). Its 31 unit tests had never executed once.
  * `er-build-export` -- the crate that produces the share link, 93 tests including the
    acceptance check that runs the planner's own decoder -- was in no gate whatsoever.

The suite was green throughout. That is the failure mode: a green suite that is silent
about crates it never selected.

The audit those two prompted, over all 64 workspace members, found 23 more crates in the
same state: 334 test functions across 25 crates that had never executed once, in any gate,
ever. All 334 passed the first time they were run, which is the good outcome and not the
point -- nothing in the repo would have said otherwise if they had not.

# What "runs" means here, and why counting crates is not enough

A crate being named in a `cargo test` line does NOT mean its tests run. `cargo test -p
er-quit-menu-core` reports "ok. 43 passed" over a crate with 73 `#[test]` functions: the
other 30 live under `#[cfg(windows)] mod ...` and do not exist on the host -- not
compiled, not listed, not failed, not counted. Measured, both numbers, 2026-08-31.

So this gate classifies every test by the TARGET able to execute it (see
`scripts/test_target_inventory.py`) and requires a runner on that target:

  * host-runnable tests need a HOST `cargo test` naming the crate;
  * windows-only tests need a WINDOWS `cargo xwin test` naming the crate (check-rust-build.sh
    runs those under wine);
  * integration tests in `tests/*.rs` need a runner that is not restricted to `--lib`.

# Orphaned files

A third class, found while building this: `#[test]` functions in a file that NO module
tree reaches -- not declared with `mod`, not `include!`d. cargo never compiles it, so the
tests are not merely unrun, they are not even built, and nothing anywhere says so.
`ORPHANED_TEST_FILES` is the acknowledged list; anything else is a failure.

# Non-vacuity

An audit that stops matching reports a clean tree over a broken one -- the failure nine
audits in this repo shipped in one week. So `--selftest` does two things before the live
check is trusted:

  1. A frozen synthetic crate exercising EVERY gating mechanism this workspace uses -- a
     `#[cfg(windows)] mod` declaration, a file-level `#![cfg(windows)]`, a `#[cfg(...)]`
     written AFTER `#[test]` on the same function, `include!` splicing, `#[path]`, and a
     non-default feature -- with exact expected counts per class. A classifier that stops
     seeing one of those mechanisms changes a number here and goes red.
  2. Live properties: each mechanism must still be OBSERVED in the real workspace, so a
     fixture that has drifted away from the code fails too. Properties rather than frozen
     totals, deliberately: several agents edit this tree concurrently and a frozen total
     goes red on somebody else's new test, which teaches people to bump the number.
  3. The five failure paths, driven end to end on synthetic workspaces: a crate with no
     host runner, a crate whose windows-only tests have no windows runner (the
     er-quit-menu-core shape, invisible to crate-granularity bookkeeping), `--lib` offered
     as covering `tests/*.rs`, a test behind an unenabled feature, and an orphaned file.
     Plus a false-positive control (a fully covered fixture must be silent) and a negative
     control (a crate with no tests is not a finding).

`--prove-selftest-catches-regression` blinds the windows matcher and requires the selftest
itself to fail.

The classifier was calibrated by hand on 2026-08-31 against real cargo output; the
per-crate numbers are in the table below and each is reproducible with
`cargo test -p X --all-targets -- --list` (host) or
`CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_PC_WINDOWS_MSVC_RUNNER=wine cargo xwin test --lib -p X --target
x86_64-pc-windows-msvc -- --list` (windows). Those commands are NOT run from here: a cold
cross-compile plus a wine launch is minutes, and every subprocess in this repo is capped at
30 seconds.
