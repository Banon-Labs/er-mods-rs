"""Regression for the narrated-action classifier, in both directions.

The Rego suite pins what the policy does with a facts line; this pins where the facts line comes
from. Both halves matter, and the split is deliberate: a policy can be green while the classifier
that feeds it has drifted into calling every gerund a narration, which is the failure mode that
makes a guard get switched off.

It imports `scripts/cupcake_narrated_action.py`, the single definition that
`.cupcake/signals/last_assistant_narrated_action.sh` and
`scripts/audit-narrated-action-false-positives.py` also use, so the test cannot pass against a
classifier production does not run.

Five things are pinned:
  * narrated_action    -- the six verbatim closers convict -- the five participial ones from
                          2026-09-10 and the trailing first-person one from 2026-09-11 -- and a
                          gerund that is the subject of an ordinary sentence never does;
  * reported_outcome   -- a measured outcome beside the narration exempts;
  * launch_banner      -- the banner `AGENTS.md` mandates, in both spellings this repo writes it in;
  * externally_blocked -- a dependency the agent cannot dissolve;
  * the verb boundary  -- the gerunds `ER-EFFECTS-NO-PROMISSORY-CLOSER` owns are read out of its own
                          signal file and must not appear in this classifier's table, or one closing
                          sentence would be charged twice with two different corrections.
