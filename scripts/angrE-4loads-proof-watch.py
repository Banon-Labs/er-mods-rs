"""Prove save slot angrE loads >=N (default 4) times IN A ROW via the DLL, no crash / no stall.

WHY v2 (the v1 MMS-FINISH oracle was WRONG): `MMS-FINISH` fires once per map-block MoveMap
completion, i.e. MANY times per single character load (a boot autoload emitted 10 within 3.4s),
so counting it declared a false "10 loads". A genuine controllable load is instead the game's own
RAM state: the player character becomes RENDER-READY / AVAILABLE and STAYS that way. This harness
polls the DLL's live telemetry.json (RAM oracles) and counts a load only when the player reaches a
sustained controllable state, with a return-to-title dip required between consecutive loads so one
settled load can never be miscounted as several.

GENUINE-LOAD oracle (per load, rising edge that persists):
  a load counts when oracle_player_render_ready (or player_available) has been True for >= PERSIST_S
  continuous seconds AND oracle_char_name == angrE. The NEXT load is only eligible after the player
  first drops out of the controllable state (render_ready & available both False) -- i.e. a real
  System->Quit / return-title dip. This makes each count a distinct load, not a sample.

CRASH disproof: a new `access-violation` line in the crash log, or the game process exiting, before
N loads -> FAIL (the switch-#4 GX command-queue overflow AV is exactly this).

STALL disproof: game alive, fewer than N loads, and NO new genuine load for STALL_S seconds while
also not currently sustaining a fresh controllable state -> FAIL. Lenient by default so user-paced
System->Quit->Continue think-time does not trip it.

This harness does NOT tear the game down except on a final verdict, and it prints incremental state
so the operator can see each load land. RAM oracles are the run-stopping evidence; the wall clock is
only a backstop. Screenshots are never consulted.
