"""Record and judge Frida evidence, so a Rust edit has to be preceded by a measurement.

# Why this exists

User directive 2026-09-16, after the agent tore the game down twice and ran two build/relaunch
cycles to land a change whose mechanism was never measured: "why would you build, if you haven't
proven you can do it with Frida yet?" AGENTS.md already said it -- "The order is Frida, then Frida,
then Frida, and only then a DLL ... Build a DLL when the mechanism is already known and the code is
the product, never to find something out" -- and the agent did it anyway. A note that is ignored is
not a rule, so this is the executable half.

`.cupcake/policies/claude/no_rust_edit_without_frida_proof.rego` refuses a Write/Edit under
`crates/**/*.rs` unless this says `PROVEN`, and the `--check` verdict is the only thing that opens
that door.

# What counts as evidence

A record is appended by the Frida entry points themselves when a session ends, carrying what that
session actually did: the agent file, the pid it attached to, how many `send()` messages came back,
and how long it ran. A session that attached and observed nothing reports `messages=0` and does not
count -- the point is going and looking, and a watcher that saw nothing did not look at anything.

The log lives under `XDG_STATE_HOME` (default `~/.local/state/er-mods-rs/`), not in the repo, so the
gate's evidence is not a file the gated Write tool can create.

# The second instrument, and the blind spot it closes

Frida reaches the game. It does not reach our own DLLs. A release `cdylib` in this workspace
exports `DllMain` and nothing else, so an unexported Rust static, a `pub(crate)` seam, or the
question "which of our functions calls which of our setters" has no address for `Interceptor` to
attach to and no name for `DebugSymbol` to resolve. For that class of change the gate used to
demand an instrument which physically cannot see the subject, and an agent facing it either stalls
or reaches for the forgery routes named below -- neither of which is the behaviour this was written
to get.

Measured 2026-09-19, which is the run this section exists for. `er-save-game-row` opened its
destination browser undressed because `gfx_swap::set_profile_05_010_edit_armed` has exactly one
caller, in `arm::arm_standalone`, and that shell hand-rolls its arm instead. The defect was already
measured -- by our own code, at the branch, in a live run:

    05_010 stats-panel edit not armed -- no browse row and no host that dresses a character row
    served 05_010_profileselect (the picker's own cache key) ... memory_replacement=false

That is not weaker than a Frida hook. At a branch it is stronger: a hook outside the module has to
infer which way the branch went from its effects, while the branch itself says so. So in-process
telemetry from a live run is admitted as evidence -- under three conditions that keep it a
measurement rather than an assertion:

  * the quoted line must be present verbatim in the named log, so it comes off a run rather than
    out of an argument;
  * the log must be newer than the last committed Rust change, the same staleness rule Frida
    evidence lives under;
  * it licenses one crate -- the shell whose telemetry it is -- and not the tree.

That last one makes it narrower than the Frida path, which opens every crate at once.

    python3 scripts/er-frida-evidence.py --record-telemetry \
        --crate er-save-game-row \
        --log "$GAME/er-save-game-row.log" \
        --line "05_010 stats-panel edit not armed"

# How far that goes, honestly

This heading used to read "and why it cannot be written by hand", which was false, and a false claim
here is worse than the hole it papers over -- the next agent believes it. Measured against the live
engine 2026-09-16, with no evidence present, every one of these was allowed:

    python3 scripts/er-frida-evidence.py --record --agent x --pid 1 --messages 12 --seconds 9
    echo '{"at": 9999999999, "messages": 12}' >> ~/.local/state/er-mods-rs/frida-evidence.jsonl
    an Edit to this file, to `.cupcake/signals/frida_evidence.sh`, or to the policy itself
    a Bash `cat > crates/<crate>/src/lib.rs <<EOF`, which is not an Edit and is not routed

The `XDG_STATE_HOME` placement closes exactly one route, the repo-relative Write, and nothing else.
Everything above is one command. So this is a gate against an agent that reaches for a build when it
should reach for a hook -- the failure it was written for -- and not against one that has decided to
get around it. Treat the two differently: the first is what the refusal text talks to, and the
second is a choice no amount of rego reaches.

# What makes a record stale

Evidence is spent by a commit. A record counts only if it is newer than `HEAD`'s commit time, so one
measurement licenses the edits of one change and the next change needs its own. Without that the
first Frida run of a session would license every edit after it forever, which is the same "I looked
once" excuse in a machine-readable costume.

    python3 scripts/er-frida-evidence.py --record --agent scripts/frida/x.js --pid 388 --messages 12

    `crates/` being written without somebody going and looking first, so the thing that consumes
    a measurement is a committed Rust change -- and only that. Keying on plain `HEAD` made every
    commit spend it, including ones that cannot possibly have used it: on 2026-09-17 a
    `scripts/`-only commit (`a8c11bb1`, the launch-gate cache) spent a live measurement taken
    minutes earlier, and the next Rust edit was refused with `spent-by-commit` for a reason that
    had nothing to do with Rust. That is a false refusal, not a strict one, and a gate that
    refuses for the wrong reason teaches the next agent to look for a way around it.

    The pathspec is the same shape the policy uses to decide what it guards: `*.rs` under
