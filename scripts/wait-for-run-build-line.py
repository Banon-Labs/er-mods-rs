"""Wait for a run directory's DLLs to write their `build git=` line, and print the sha.

`scripts/er-run-branch.py` returns once the quickload DLL's own log line confirms it loaded. The
other shells in the profile write their first line a moment later, so anything reading the run's
build sha at that instant is racing them -- and `scripts/er-ship.sh` lost that race twice on
2026-09-10, refusing to push a run that was seconds away from proving itself, with
`still stale after a rebuild (<none>)`.

The wait is on inotify rather than on a poll loop, because a poll loop is a sleep and
`scripts/check-no-timeouts.py` bans those in every language this repo writes. `select` on the
inotify descriptor returns when the kernel says a file in the directory changed, and its timeout
is the safety cap rather than the mechanism.

A `+dirty` line is not an answer here: the tree carried uncommitted changes when the DLL was
built, so this cannot tell whether the binary is the commit. The push guard can, and since
2026-09-11 it does -- `scripts/er-runtime-evidence.py` accepts a dirty build line when a provenance
record proves the shell's own dependency closure was committed. Waiting past one is the safe
difference: it costs a rebuild the guard might not have demanded, never a push of unrun code.

    python3 scripts/wait-for-run-build-line.py <run-dir> [--timeout-seconds N]
    python3 scripts/wait-for-run-build-line.py --selftest

Prints the sha and exits 0, or prints nothing and exits 1 if the cap passes first.
