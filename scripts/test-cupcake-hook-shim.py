"""Prove the cupcake hook shim evaluates, still DENIES, and restores the newline separator.

WHY THIS GATE EXISTS
--------------------
Two production defects, both invisible by construction -- a guard that never runs looks
exactly like a guard that allowed you -- so both are asserted here rather than trusted.

1. PERMISSION MODES. cupcake 0.5.2 deserializes `permission_mode` into a closed enum and
   exits 1 on anything outside {default, plan, acceptEdits, bypassPermissions}. Claude Code
   shipped an `auto` mode, so on 2026-08-24 EVERY hook in this repo -- PreToolUse and
   PostToolUse included -- failed with

       Error: unknown variant `auto`, expected one of `default`, `plan`, ...

   for a whole session, with every policy in .cupcake/policies silently not running. The
   suite was green throughout, exactly like the 2026-08-22 episode recorded in check.sh. An
   unrecognised permission mode must degrade to "evaluate anyway", never to "evaluate
   nothing".

2. UNQUOTED NEWLINES (bd er-effects-rs-5eah). `cupcake eval` replaces unquoted newlines with
   spaces before any policy runs, so the second and later LINES of a Bash command arrive with
   no separator in front of them and are invisible to every guard that anchors on a shell
   separator class. A two-line command whose first line was harmless and whose second pushed
   to main was ALLOWED in production while `opa test` denied the same text. The shim rewrites
   unquoted newlines to `; ` before cupcake sees them; newlines inside quoted spans, and
   inside a heredoc body a non-shell command reads, are left alone.

WHAT IT ASSERTS
---------------
  * for a known mode, the `auto` mode that broke it, and an invented future one: the shim
    exits 0, emits parseable JSON, still denies a denied command, still allows a benign one,
    and keeps stderr quiet (the default `info` level floods ~4KB per event);
  * the exact rewritten command text for the quoting shapes the rewrite turns on, driven
    through the shim's own `--normalize-only` mode so there is one implementation, not two;
  * the DECISION the real cupcake binary reaches for every separator case, denials and the
    allow-shapes that must not regress alike.

`--table` prints the decision each case gets BEFORE the rewrite (the raw event handed
straight to `cupcake eval`, which is what production did until this change) beside the one it
gets AFTER, which is how the fix was measured in the first place. Only the rewrite and the
permission-mode normalisation are removed from the BEFORE column: it loads the SAME policy set
the shim loads, global config included, so a difference in the table is the shim's doing and
nothing else's.
