# `bd prime`, which emits that bounded file instead of the multi-MB default
# (every-memory-body) dump. Keeping regeneration here means the index is always fresh
# AND always bounded, and any bare `bd prime` (Pi, Codex, manual) also gets it.

# Regeneration is SKIPPED when PRIME.md is younger than BEADS_PRIME_MAX_AGE_SECONDS
# (default 6h). It costs a 4.6 MB `bd memories --json` read plus a 212 KB `bd ready
# --json` read, and this hook also fires on PreCompact -- the one moment where the
# session is already under pressure and the memory index has not meaningfully changed
# since SessionStart. Set BEADS_PRIME_MAX_AGE_SECONDS=0 to force regeneration.
