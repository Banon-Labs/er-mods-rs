"""SWEEP 2 detector: writes derived from a game-image RVA that no HOOK audit can see.

MinHook-shaped audits look at detour installs. These four classes never touch MinHook,
so nothing had ever checked them:

  SLOT     a store into a function-pointer table / vtable slot (`*(slot as *mut usize) = ...`)
  RVA_ARG  a byte-patch primitive that takes `(base, rva)` as SEPARATE ARGUMENTS -- invisible
           to any regex looking for the text `base + SOMETHING_RVA`
  SENTINEL `game_data_addr(..) + offset`, which destroys the `0`-means-refused sentinel:
           a refusal on row 3 yields the address 24, and `if addr != 0` waves it through
  RAW      a raw store whose address expression contains `base + *_rva` in any casing

Every class has a POSITIVE CONTROL in `--selftest`, because a detector that reports zero
is indistinguishable from a detector that matches nothing: `audit-1170-readiness.py`
reported ZERO ungated writes while six existed, and its `HAND_BUILT` pattern required an
uppercase `RVA` so `base + spec.rva` matched 0 of 40 real sites.

Exits 1 on any finding (since 2026-08-31). It used to only report, and it reported six
findings that were every one of them false: two were the primitives' own `fn` declarations
and four were call sites of primitives that gate INTERNALLY. With those two matcher faults
fixed the true count is zero, so the class can be held at zero instead of narrated.
The complementary ratchet is `scripts/audit-1170-readiness.py`.

# `er_game_base::game_build::resolve_game_address`, refuse on `None`, then audit the site with
# `detour_site::write_site_is_sound` and confirm the expected first byte. The gate is INSIDE the
# primitive, which is the right place for it -- a per-call-site gate would be four copies of one
# rule, and the class as originally written could not distinguish "ungated" from "gated somewhere
# this regex cannot see", so it reported all six as findings and gated nothing.
#
# The invariant that is actually worth failing a build over is therefore not "does this call site
# gate" but "does the PRIMITIVE still gate". Delete that `resolve_game_address` line and all four
# call sites silently become raw writes into a 1.17 image at 1.16.2 offsets, with no other check in
# the tree noticing. So: a call site is reported only when the primitive it calls has lost its
# gate, and a primitive whose definition is not in the scanned set is treated as ungated
# (fail-closed -- an audit that cannot see the definition must not vouch for it).
