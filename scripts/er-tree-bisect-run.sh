# Build er_effects_rs.dll from the CURRENT tree, then score it exactly like a release artifact.
#
# The scoring -- launch it alone, wait, decide from thread count and CPU burn rather than from a
# pid existing -- lives in scripts/er-release-bisect.py and is not repeated here. This exists only
# because that tool deliberately cannot build: every subprocess it starts is held under the 30s
# agent-shell cap (scripts/check-no-timeouts.py), and a cold cross-compile takes minutes. So the
# build happens in bash, where a compile is not a timeout violation, and the artifact is handed
# over by path.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/er-tree-bisect-run.sh <label> [alive-seconds]
#
# A cold build takes minutes -- run this detached, not in a foreground shell.
