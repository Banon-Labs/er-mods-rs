"""Route `transmute(base + SOME_RVA)` call sites through the 1.17 address gate, in bulk.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`scripts/check-stale-rva-calls.py` counts the sites and refuses new ones. Converting them is the
other half, and on 2026-08-29 there were 210 of them across the workspace -- too many to edit by
hand, and each edit is the same shape:

    let f: Fn = unsafe { transmute(base + SOME_RVA) };
    ->
    let f: Fn = unsafe { transmute(match helper(SOME_RVA, "SOME_RVA") {
        Some(address) => address,
        None => <bail>,
    }) };

WHAT IT REFUSES TO TOUCH
------------------------
The bail is the whole risk, so this only rewrites a site whose bail is unambiguous:

  * NEVER inside an `extern "system"` function. Those are detours, and a detour that returns early
    never calls its original -- which silently deletes the game's own behaviour instead of adding
    ours. Measured: `hud_weapon_update_hook` needed `return ret`, not `return`.
  * ONLY where the enclosing function's return type maps to an obvious "did nothing" value:
    `()`, `bool`, an integer, `f32`. Anything else (a struct, a tuple, `Option<...>` where `None`
    might mean something specific) is printed for a human instead of guessed at.

Everything it skips is listed, so the remainder is a work-list rather than a silence.

IT USED TO REWRITE ENGLISH SENTENCES, AND ON 2026-08-30 THAT WAS ALL IT DID
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The matcher ran over RAW file text. Run over this workspace on 2026-08-30 it reported
`gated 1 / 2 site(s)` -- and BOTH of those "call sites" were PROSE:

    crates/er-invasion-warp-core/src/lib.rs:51   /// ... used to be a bare `transmute(base + SOME_RVA)`.
    crates/er-game-base/src/game_build.rs:284    // ... equally reachable as a CALL (`transmute(base + RVA)`)

The first is the one it counted as GATED, which means a non-dry run would have rewritten a doc
comment into `transmute(helper(SOME_RVA, "SOME_RVA"))` -- a sentence about the hazard turned into
code that describes nothing, in the header of the crate that documents it. Those are the same two
paragraphs that contaminated `check-stale-rva-calls.py`'s baseline; for a COUNTER that was an
inflated number, and for a REWRITER it is a corrupted file. Comments and string bodies are now
blanked before matching -- through the shared `rva_symbols.code_only`, so there is one dialect
rather than a fourth -- and the replacement is spliced into the ORIGINAL text at the offsets that
reader reports, which it can do because the blanking preserves offsets exactly.

AND IT TRUSTED THE CONSTANT'S NAME, ITS SHAPE, AND THE BASE'S SPELLING
---------------------------------------------------------------------
`[A-Z0-9_]*RVA[A-Z0-9_]*` is a naming convention, not evidence. What makes a site a stale call is
the ARITHMETIC -- a module base plus a compile-time constant, transmuted and called -- and the
arithmetic does not care what the constant is spelled. Three spellings defeated the old pattern
outright, each of them measured standing in live code while the sibling gate reported zero:

  NO SUFFIX      `er-build-import-runtime` calls `GET_MAIN_PLAYER_STATS` and thirty-nine more by
                 those names; `use ...::FOO_RVA as FOO;` strips the suffix at the import, which
                 is exactly where this tool looks.
  A MACRO BASE   `own_stepper_idx10_fallbacks!` receives the module base as a metavariable, so its
                 body reads `transmute($base + TITLE_TOP_DIALOG_IS_IN_STATE_RVA)` -- a function
                 that moved 0x749b20 -> 0x74a970, leaving the 1.16.2 address mid-instruction.
  AN ENUM        `er-title-flow` keeps its addresses in C-like enums:
                 `transmute(base + ProfileLoadMenuRva::ProfileLoadSelectSaveSlot as usize)` called
                 1.16.2's 0x9a5f20 on a build where it lives at 0x9a70c0.

A TURBOFISH also hid sites: `transmute::<usize, F>(base + MENU_RVA)` is the same call.

THE VALUE GATE
--------------
Dropping the name filter admits `base + PE_DOS_LFANEW_OFFSET` -- the DOS header's `0x3c` field,
fixed by the PE format and unable to move between builds. Those are excluded by VALUE, below
`.text`'s 0x1000, and never by name: an exclusion has to rest on what the thing IS. A constant
whose value cannot be resolved is KEPT, because "I could not read it" must not be spelled the same
way as "I read it and it is safe".
