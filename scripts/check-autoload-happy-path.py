# THE MEASURE CONTRACT IS GONE, AND SO ARE THE 18 ASSERTIONS THAT CHECKED IT (2026-08-19).
#
# This file used to assert that `.auto/measure.sh` scored the autoload happy path -- that it
# exposed `readiness_gate_failures`, read the er-title-flow sources, penalised
# Seamless-contaminated artifacts, and so on. Commit 40ed6c5a ("Add the crate-extraction plans
# of record for experiments/", #193) DELETED 1573 lines of that file and replaced them with a
# 119-line crate-extraction roadmap progress measurer. The autoload measure did not move: a
# tree-wide search for `readiness_gate_failures` finds this checker and nothing else.
#
# So the 18 failures were not telling anyone their branch was broken. They fired identically on
# every branch, including a detached worktree of the base -- and because this runs at line 24 of
# `scripts/check.sh` under `set -e`, EVERYTHING after it was skipped: `cargo fmt --check`, the
# me3 shell-coverage and DLL-conflict gates, the launcher selftests, and `check-rust-build.sh`.
# A branch could be misformatted or fail to link every shell and still look merely
# "gate-blocked for an unrelated reason". A permanently red gate does not protect anything; it
# teaches people to walk past the one place the real failures would have shown up.
#
# The 69 remaining assertions check the PRODUCT source and are untouched -- they are what
# actually guards autoload behaviour. If a scored autoload measure is ever rebuilt, re-add its
# contract here deliberately, against the file that then implements it. See bd er-effects-rs-ni41.
