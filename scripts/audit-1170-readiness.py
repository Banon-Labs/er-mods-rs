"""Score every cdylib on whether a STALE game address can still reach ELDEN RING 1.17 silently.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The game went 1.16.2 -> 1.17 on 2026-08-27 and every RVA in this workspace was written for 1.16.2.
`er_game_base::game_build` translates or REFUSES a known address, and `er-hook`'s `MhHook::new`
routes detours through it -- so a hook on a moved function fails loudly instead of corrupting the
image. That protection only covers addresses that actually go through it.

Three things a hand-built `base + SOME_RVA` can be used FOR, and they are not equally dangerous.
Counting them together overstates the problem by an order of magnitude, so this separates them:

  EXEC   `transmute(base + SOME_RVA)` and then call it. On 1.17 that is a call into whatever now
         occupies the address. Nothing refuses, nothing logs, and the game executes it. WORST.
         NOTE: a MAPPED constant used this way is just as broken as an unmapped one. The map knows
         the 1.17 destination; `base + RVA` never asks it, so the call still goes to the 1.16.2
         address. Sites are tagged `[UNMAPPED]` only to say whether the fix is one `game_rva()`
         call away or needs the address found first -- never to say the site is safe.
  WRITE  a raw store / `write_code_byte` at `base + SOME_RVA`. Corrupts the image for every later
         reader, not just this one caller.
  READ   `safe_read_usize(base + SOME_RVA)`, or an identity compare `vt != base + SOME_VTABLE_RVA`.
         Fault-safe by construction: a stale address yields a wrong answer or `None`, never a
         fault. This is the SILENT class -- the feature quietly stops working and nothing says so.
         Measured 2026-08-29: `TITLE_OWNER_VTABLE_RVA` is `CS::TitleStep` in 1.16.2 and nothing in
         1.17, and its three scans simply find no owner, forever, without a single log line.

A raw write PRECEDED BY A SIGNATURE CHECK is counted separately and is not a defect: comparing the
expected opcode before storing turns a stale address into a refusal. Measured 2026-08-29 --
`apply_splash_skip` did exactly that and logged `ABORT -- byte at 0x140b0c35d is 0x4a, expected
0x74` on a 1.17 image where the naive write would have smashed a `lea` displacement.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CLAIM
----------------------
Zero ungated sites is not "this DLL works on 1.17". It means no address can reach the game without
the gate having a say. Whether the mapped destinations are the RIGHT functions is
`scripts/verify-rva-map-1170.py`'s job, and whether the DLL then behaves is a runtime question --
the `runtime` column is read from a recorded results file, never inferred.

HOW THIS DIVIDES WITH `check-stale-rva-calls.py`
------------------------------------------------
That script already ratchets ungated CALLS repo-wide, keyed on (file, RVA constant). It is the
authority on that set and on converting it; this one deliberately does not re-litigate it. What
this adds is the two things a repo-wide call count cannot say:

  * PER-CDYLIB attribution. A flat repo-wide total hides one DLL regressing while another
    improves, and "does THIS DLL have 1.17 fixes" is a per-DLL question.
  * The WRITE and read/compare buckets, which that script does not measure at all. 0 ungated
    WRITEs across all 27 cdylibs is a safety property nothing else in the tree guards.

Refresh both baselines together when you bank an improvement.

WHAT THE `consts` AND `unmapd` COLUMNS COULD SEE UNTIL 2026-08-30
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Three regexes -- `CONST`, `CONST_ALIAS`, `USE_ALIAS` -- decided which constants exist and what
address each holds. All three required the name to be spelled `*RVA*`, and the first also required
`: usize` and a hex literal on the spot. A constant they could not resolve has no address, so it is
tagged `[UNMAPPED]` at every use site: the audit says "this needs a 1.17 row" about an address that
may well already have one, and the map owner is sent to re-derive it. Five ordinary spellings were
invisible: `: u32` / `: u64` constants, enum discriminants, constants DEFINED from a discriminant,
constants whose name never carried the suffix, and every constant declared in a crate this closure
does not include but whose value it uses.

Values now come from `scripts/rva_symbols.py`. Measured on this tree: 362 -> 640 constants resolved
across the union of all 27 cdylib closures, and `er-quickload` alone went 285 -> 534.

TWO THINGS THAT DELIBERATELY DID NOT CHANGE, so the widening does not manufacture work:

  * WHAT COUNTS AS AN ADDRESS. Dropping the name filter without a replacement would file every
    millisecond cap and bitmask as an unmapped address. The replacement is by what the constant IS
    or DOES -- see `ADDRESS_NAME` / `ADDRESS_USE` / `mapped_source_addresses` below -- never by
    what it is called alone.
  * `HAND_BUILT`, the USE-site matcher, keeps its `*RVA*` operand filter. Measured: dropping it
    adds 55 matches across 32 new operand names, and they are PE-header fields
    (`PE_DOS_LFANEW_OFFSET`, `DOS_PE_OFFSET_FIELD`), struct offsets (`REC_LEVEL_OFFSET`) and plain
    locals (`i`, `gap`, `size`, `offset`) -- not stale-address hazards. `check-stale-rva-calls.py`
    does drop that filter, because it has a VALUE gate to exclude the PE fields by what they are;
    this audit has none, so here the filter earns its place. That division is the one the "HOW THIS
    DIVIDES" section above already draws.

THE RATCHET
-----------
`--check` compares the per-DLL counts against `docs/recon/dll-1170-ungated-ledger.tsv` and exits 1
if any went UP. That is the part that makes this a proof rather than a snapshot: 0 ungated WRITEs
across all 27 cdylibs is a real safety property today, and the ledger is what stops the next commit
from quietly taking it away. `--refresh` rewrites the ledger, so a deliberate increase shows up as
a reviewable diff instead of the invisible default.

    The 2026-08-30 failure was not a regex missing a syntax; it was the reader keying on the SHAPE
    it expected a column to have. `mapped_constants()` returned column 3 verbatim, so a row labelled
    with a `file.rs:line` source location contributed a source location to a set that was then
    searched for constant NAMES -- and every such row read `[UNMAPPED]` while being fully mapped.

    Asserting `mapped_constants()` in isolation would not catch a recurrence, because what broke is
    the JOIN between the table and the use site. So this runs the whole `scan()` over source text
    that uses four real addresses under names the tables have never heard of, and asserts the tag:

      * a row whose label is a CONSTANT NAME                    -> recognised, by address

    The last case is the negative control, and it is the reason this cannot pass by tagging
