"""Audit the SHIPPED moveset table for creatures no attack button can reach.

The table's job is to say what a possessed creature can do. A row that classifies every
move into the `movement` bucket says the creature can walk and nothing else, and with the
default `r1=light r2=heavy l1=ranged l2=movement` mapping that leaves three of the four
attack buttons dead and the fourth playing a walk cycle. That is either the truth (a
Balloon Dummy has no attacks) or a hole in the generator, and the two are indistinguishable
from the table alone -- which is what this script is for.

It joins the shipped table against `scripts/er-moveset-tae-owner.py`, so every attackless
creature comes out labelled with a CAUSE:

  genuinely-attackless   its own TimeAct was read and describes no attack
  missing-timeact        its TimeAct lives under the family base and was not read
  no-timeact-anywhere    no TimeAct under either id in this corpus

Usage:
  scripts/er-moveset-coverage.py                          # summary + attackless list
  scripts/er-moveset-coverage.py --table <path> --json out.json
  scripts/er-moveset-coverage.py --check                  # exit 1 if any missing-timeact

    tell you which -- both rows look like twelve `W_Step` clips and `denied=0`. So this opens the
    TimeAct that describes the creature (its own, or its family base's; see
    `er-moveset-tae-owner.py`) and counts attack-band animations carrying an ability event that
    resolves to a real `AtkParam_Npc` or `Bullet` row. Non-zero means the game has attacks for this
    creature that the shipped table is not offering, which is a bug; zero means it genuinely has
    none.
