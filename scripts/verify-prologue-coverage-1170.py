"""Prove the prologue sweep SEES every `PrologueSpec`, and measure how much each pin discriminates.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`docs/er-1.17-migration.md` claimed "all 36 specs swept against the 1.17 image".  There is no set
of 36 specs.  The workspace declares **42** `PrologueSpec`s across five `build.rs` files, and the
generator emits **two** constants per spec (a pin and a `_MASK`), so the numbers in circulation --
36, 84, "48 never swept" -- came from comparing a CONSTANT count against a SPEC count:

    42 specs x 2 constants = 84        18 er-quickload specs x 2 = 36        84 - 36 = 48

Every one of the 42 was in fact already swept: `verify-aob-patterns-1170.py` globs
`crates/*/build.rs`, not one crate.  The defect was never an unswept spec -- it was that a
DOCUMENT asserted a coverage number that nothing computed.  A count in prose cannot go red.

So this gate computes the number instead of asserting it, and fails when the sweep's enumerator
cannot reach a spec that exists.  Two sections:

  coverage    Walk the WHOLE repository for `PrologueSpec` declarations and compare that set
              against what `verify-aob-patterns-1170.py` can actually enumerate.  A spec-bearing
              file the sweep cannot see is a hard failure.  This is the half that would have
              caught the original defect, and it is the half that is not currently covered:
              `_build_scripts()` globs `crates/*/build.rs`, which is exactly ONE directory level
              deep.  A crate whose build script moves to `crates/foo/dll/build.rs` -- and sibling
              worktrees are actively renaming crates to `*-dll` right now -- becomes invisible to
              the sweep while still shipping live prologue gates.  It would not appear as a SKIP
              or a gap; it would not appear at all, and the sweep would keep printing a green
              total that silently shrank.

  uniqueness  For each spec, count how many places in the 1.17 image the pin matches UNDER ITS
              OWN MASK, and say whether the mapped address is one of them.

WHAT `uniqueness` DOES AND DOES NOT CLAIM
-----------------------------------------
Read this before quoting a number out of it.

A prologue gate is not a scanner.  The DLL takes its address from the 1.17 ledger and compares
bytes AT that address; it never searches.  So a pin that also matches elsewhere does NOT mean the
hook lands in the wrong place -- the address did not come from the pattern.

What multiplicity measures is the gate's DISCRIMINATING POWER: whether the byte check could tell
that a mis-translated address is wrong.  A 7-byte MSVC opening like `40 53 57 48 83 ec 68` occurs
in thousands of functions, so it will accept essentially any function entry handed to it.  That
is not a bug in the pin -- it is what the function's first bytes are -- but it does bound what an
ARMS verdict is worth, and that bound has never been written down.  bd
`stale-aob-that-still-matches-is-worse-than-no-match-calibrate-on-the-old-image-2026-08-30` is
about precisely this failure shape: agreement that is confident and uninformative.

Verdicts:
  UNIQUE      one match in the whole image, at the mapped address.  ARMS is decisive here.
  AMBIGUOUS   matches at the mapped address AND elsewhere.  ARMS is correct but weak: the pin
              would have accepted N other addresses just as happily.  NOT a defect by itself.
  MISPLACED   matches somewhere, but NOT at the mapped address.  The spec is right about the
              bytes and the ledger is wrong about where they went.
  ABSENT      matches nowhere in 1.17.  The function changed.

`n1162` is the same count taken on the 1.16.2 image, which is the calibration the bd memory asks
for: a pin that was already non-unique on the build it was authored against never had the power
being claimed for it, and its 1.17 multiplicity is not a regression.

USAGE
    python3 scripts/verify-prologue-coverage-1170.py                 # both sections
    python3 scripts/verify-prologue-coverage-1170.py --selftest      # no images, no build needed
    python3 scripts/verify-prologue-coverage-1170.py --section coverage
    python3 scripts/verify-prologue-coverage-1170.py --require-images
    python3 scripts/verify-prologue-coverage-1170.py --json <path>   # machine-readable dump

Exit 0 = the sweep can enumerate every declared spec.  Exit non-zero = a count of problems.

`uniqueness` is REPORTING, not a gate: it never contributes to the exit code, because a low-power
pin is a fact about the game's code and not something a commit can be blocked on.  Only
`coverage` fails the build.
