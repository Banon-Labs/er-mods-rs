"""Carry a MID-FUNCTION 1.16.2 address (a call site or return site) onto ELDEN RING 1.17.

`map-rvas-1162-to-1170.py` maps FUNCTION ENTRIES. Several addresses in this workspace are not
entries at all: they are the address of an instruction INSIDE a function, used to recognise a
caller from a captured return address (`trace_first_game_caller_rva`,
`callstack_contains_game_rva`). Handing one of those to the entry mapper is meaningless -- there
is no `.pdata` entry to match and no prologue to sign -- and hooking one would be worse.

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
Given a mid-function 1.16.2 VA and the entry of the function that contains it, it decodes BOTH
functions from their entries in lockstep, comparing each instruction normalised the way the rest
of this toolchain normalises (mnemonic + register operand shape; displacements, immediates and
branch targets dropped, because that is exactly what a patch moves). When the two bodies agree
instruction for instruction up to the target, the 1.17 address is the byte offset of the SAME
instruction index in the 1.17 function -- which is NOT necessarily `target + function delta`,
because a single changed instruction length shifts everything after it.

It refuses rather than guesses:
  * the target must land exactly on an instruction boundary in 1.16.2;
  * the two decodes must agree on every instruction up to that point;
  * both functions must be declared by their image's own `.pdata`.

USAGE
    python3 scripts/map-callsite-rva-1162-to-1170.py 0x140744e02
    python3 scripts/map-callsite-rva-1162-to-1170.py --entry 0x140744dd0 0x140744e02

With no `--entry` the containing function is looked up in the 1.16.2 `.pdata`, and its 1.17
counterpart in `docs/recon/rva-map-1162-to-1170.functions.tsv`.
