# `|| [[ -n ... ]]` IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT DEFENSIVE PADDING. `read` returns non-zero when it hits
# EOF without a delimiter, and bash then skips the loop body -- so a final line with no trailing
# newline is SILENTLY DROPPED. scripts/hooks/pre-push fed exactly that shape: it captures git's
# stdin with `pushed=$(cat)`, which strips the trailing newline, and replayed it with
# `printf '%s'`. For a single-ref push -- the normal case -- that one line was the only line, so
# this loop saw NOTHING and `git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/main` from a feature branch walked
# straight through. Measured 2026-08-31. The wrapper now sends `printf '%s\n'`, but the guard
# must not depend on being fed politely: it is the last thing between an agent and main.
