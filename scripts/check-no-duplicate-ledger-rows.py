"""Refuse a 1.16.2 -> 1.17 ledger that declares the same source address twice.

WHAT THIS CATCHES, AND WHY NOTHING ELSE DID
-------------------------------------------
`er-game-base/build.rs` reads four address ledgers, concatenates them, and finishes with

    rows.sort_unstable();
    rows.dedup_by_key(|(old, _)| *old);

`sort_unstable` orders by the WHOLE tuple, so among rows sharing a source the surviving one is the
one with the numerically SMALLEST destination. That is not a decision anybody made; it is what
`dedup_by_key` does with input it was never promised was unique. Two duplicated sources were sitting
in the curated ledger on 2026-08-30 -- `0x1408c47c0` (lines 156 and 267) and `0x1409b72b0` (lines 29
and 76). Both pairs happened to AGREE on the destination, so the emitted maps were correct; had one
pair disagreed, the map would have silently taken the lower address and no gate in the tree would
have said a word.

Nothing gated this. `check-rva-alias-drift.py` gates Rust DECLARATIONS, not ledger rows.
`check-1170-translation-collisions.py` gates a destination that is also somebody else's source --
a different defect. `verify-rva-map-1170.py` verifies a pair; it does not ask whether the pair was
written down twice. A duplicate DECLARATION had already cost an agent a full session that same day,
which is why this is a gate and not a note.

FOUR RULES, AND THE ONE THAT MUST NOT BE WIDENED
------------------------------------------------
  R1  CONFLICT              one source, two DIFFERENT destinations, inside one ledger.
  R2  CROSS-LEDGER CONFLICT one source, different destinations in two different ledgers. The CALL
                            map and the DETOUR map are assembled from different subsets, so a
                            disagreement here can route a call to A and a five-byte MinHook patch
                            to B for the same address.
  R3  REPEAT DECLARATION    one source on more than one row of a CURATED ledger, EVEN IN AGREEMENT.
  R4  DUPLICATE LINE        a byte-identical row twice, in any ledger. Needs no column semantics,
                            so it cannot be defeated by a column moving.

R3 IS DELIBERATELY NOT APPLIED TO A GENERATED LEDGER, and widening it would make this gate red on
arrival for a reason that is not a defect. `select-needed-1170-rows.py` emits ONE ROW PER DECLARING
NAME: an address the workspace names under four spellings gets four rows, identical but for the
label column. Measured 2026-08-30, before any edit: 39 such sources in `needed.tsv`, 39 in
`needed-verified.tsv`, 7 in `data.tsv` -- 85 legitimate repeats. In the CURATED ledger the third
column is a DERIVATION, not a name, so a second row there is redundancy, and redundancy is where
drift hides: the two `0x1408c47c0` rows disagreed about whether its `.pdata` record is a chained
continuation (it is a ROOT; `0x8c47c6` chains TO it), and a reader had no way to know which line
was current.

WHICH LEDGERS, AND WHAT HAPPENS TO ONE THIS FILE HAS NEVER HEARD OF
------------------------------------------------------------------
The ledger PATHS are parsed out of `crates/er-game-base/build.rs` at run time rather than
transcribed, so a fifth ledger appearing there is seen immediately. Whether a ledger is CURATED or
GENERATED cannot be parsed -- and must not be guessed. Header sniffing looks like it would work and
does not: `needed-verified.tsv`'s header contains the words "the curated ledger" inside a sentence
saying it is NOT one. So the classification is an explicit table below, and a ledger constant found
in `build.rs` that this table does not classify STOPS THE RUN (exit 2) instead of being skipped. A
partial view reporting zero duplicates is this defect class wearing a green tick.
