"""Tear down every process belonging to the Elden Ring Proton prefix, not just the obvious four.

Why this exists
---------------
bd `er-teardown-must-kill-wineserver-or-next-boot-hangs-2026-08-24` says to kill
`eldenring.exe`, `me3`, `me3-launcher.exe`, `wineserver` and `winedevice.exe`. That list is
incomplete, and the omission is what wedges the next launch.

A Wine prefix session also runs `services.exe`, `plugplay.exe`, `explorer.exe`, `svchost.exe`,
`rpcss.exe`, and (under Proton) `tabtip.exe` and `xalia.exe`. Killing only the five above leaves
about seven processes per launch alive, parented to the dead wineserver. They accumulate.

Measured 2026-08-25: after four "successful" teardowns that each verified their own list was
empty, the machine held **105** orphaned prefix processes across roughly fifteen sessions, some
days old. Every launch after the first came up as a two-thread `eldenring.exe` husk at 0% CPU --
the process exists, so a naive liveness check calls it running, and both the game's own log and
the mod DLLs' logs stop within ~100ms looking exactly like a DLL hang. It is not one.

The LIVENESS oracle, since it is the other half of the same mistake: a real Elden Ring has ~57
threads and burns CPU. Two threads at 0% is a husk. `--status` reports both rather than the
presence of a pid.

The hole that made the first version of this tool lie
-----------------------------------------------------
A Wine process's `comm` is the Windows executable name (`eldenring.exe`) while its `exe` symlink
points at `wine64-preloader`. Matching on `comm` therefore finds the Windows-side processes and
misses the entire container stack underneath them: `srt-bwrap`, `pv-adverb`, Proton's own
`python3.13`, `wine-preloader`, `wine64-preloader`. The first version of this script swept 101
processes, reported "clean -- zero prefix processes remain", and left **93** alive -- parented to
the Steam client itself, which is why the Steam UI sat on "Stopping" and every relaunch wedged.
"My list is empty" is not "the game is gone" unless the list was built the right way.

Scope
-----
The primary classifier is now the process ENVIRONMENT: `SteamGameId=1245620`,
`SteamAppId=1245620` or `STEAM_COMPAT_APP_ID=1245620`. Every process in the session inherits one,
whatever it renamed itself to, so the container layers are caught with the Windows ones. The
comm+prefix rule is kept as a second net for anything that lost its environment.

These are exact literals naming one appid. AGENTS.md forbids broad `wine`/`rsi` command-line
patterns because they match unrelated words (`rsi` matches `version`); an appid equality test in
`environ` has no such failure mode, and nothing here reads a command line.

A TEARDOWN that leaves no record is indistinguishable from a crash
------------------------------------------------------------------
`er-quickload` stamps `er-run-outcome.txt` with `outcome=running` the moment its exit hooks are
armed, and its hooks rewrite that line on the way out: `clean-exit`, `exit-unclassified`, or
`fatal-exception`. The file's own contract says that finding `running` after the process is gone
means no exit path ran -- "killed from outside (an agent teardown, `wineserver`, the OOM killer)".

Which was true and useless, because this script was one of those outside killers and said nothing.
Measured 2026-09-06: a run ended, the file read `outcome=running`, and there was no way to tell a
deliberate teardown-to-rebuild from a death nobody understood. Every agent teardown was a
permanent false positive in the one instrument built to answer "did it crash".

So this script now owns that line while it kills. It stamps before signalling -- after SIGKILL
there is no process left to write anything -- and again after the sweep, because the DLL's own
exit hooks may fire in between and overwrite the record with a code that on this target says
nothing (a normal quit exits `0xc0000005` under Proton). The `was=` field carries whatever the
file said beforehand, so nothing is destroyed by being superseded. `running` then finally means
what it claims: nobody admits to this one.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/er-teardown.py --status     # report, kill nothing
    python3 scripts/er-teardown.py              # SIGTERM, wait, SIGKILL survivors
