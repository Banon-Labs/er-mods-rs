"""One-shot migration: `er-effects-rs` -> repo `er-mods-rs` + product crate `er-quickload`.

The repo outgrew its name. `er-effects-rs` described one feature -- named SpEffect calls --
which now lives in its own crate (`er-net-effects`) and is the smallest thing here. What the
repo actually holds is ~20 ME3-loadable DLLs plus the host-side Rust libraries they are built
from. So the name splits in two, and every reference has to be classified as one or the other:

    the REPOSITORY   er-effects-rs  ->  er-mods-rs     (GitHub, clone dir, sibling-path prose)
    the PRODUCT DLL  er-effects-rs  ->  er-quickload   (crate, er_quickload.dll, .toml, .log)

A single blind substitution cannot do this: `crates/er-effects-rs` and
`github.com/Banon-Labs/er-effects-rs` are the same 13 characters meaning different things.
Hence an ORDERED, longest-alternative-first alternation resolved in ONE pass (two passes would
let an earlier rewrite feed a later rule), with the context baked into the token itself.

THREE CLASSES MUST SURVIVE UNCHANGED, and are identity-mapped so the alternation matches them
first and rewrites them to themselves:

  1. Beads issue IDs (`er-effects-rs-wncc`). Database keys for 2500+ memories and 100 issues.
     Renaming them orphans every cross-reference in the tree AND in the Dolt database, which
     this pass does not touch.
  2. `er_effects_union_register`. The cross-DLL hook-union export, resolved BY NAME through
     GetProcAddress by seven crates. A user running an already-released `er_invasion_warp.dll`
     next to a freshly built product DLL would silently lose union coordination and get two
     MinHook instances on one prologue. This is the exact class bd
     `rename-crate-name-vs-runtime-name-2026-08-25` measured going wrong last time.
  3. The DoltHub sync remote. It names an external repository that this rename does not move.

Usage: python3 scripts/rename-to-er-mods-rs.py [--apply] [--report-residue]
       Default is a dry run.
Env:   ER_MODS_REPO_ROOT, ELDEN_PROFILES_DIR (default ~/Elden) override the defaults.
