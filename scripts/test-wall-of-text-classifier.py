"""Regression for the one-paragraph rule: the classifier the signal actually runs, both directions.

This file used to carry its OWN copy of the classifier, which meant it could pass while production
counted differently -- the failure mode the shared module exists to end. It now imports
`scripts/cupcake_turn_scan.prose_paragraphs`, the single definition that
`.cupcake/signals/last_assistant_wall_of_text.sh` and
`scripts/audit-wall-of-text-false-positives.py` also use.

Two things are pinned here:
  * prose_paragraphs -- what counts as a paragraph, and what is exempt STRUCTURE (scanned, not read);
  * Turn.text_runs   -- the unit the rule measures. A tool-heavy turn's one-line preambles are
                        separate runs of one paragraph each, NOT an N-paragraph wall; scoring them
                        as one lump is what made the old guard fire on ordinary work.
