"""Which `*RVA*`-named constants are NOT game addresses, proven from how the workspace uses them.

THE DOOR THIS CLOSES
--------------------
`select-needed-1170-rows.py` and `map-data-rvas-1162-to-1170.py` both decide what to translate
with the same regex:

    const\\s+([A-Z0-9_]*RVA[A-Z0-9_]*)\\s*:\\s*(usize|u32|u64)\\s*=\\s*0x...

That is a NAME test standing in for a SEMANTIC one, and the name it tests is a SUBSTRING. Two
things follow, both measured on this tree on 2026-08-31:

  * `INTERVAL` contains `RVA`. Every `*INTERVAL*` constant in the workspace -- 35 of them, from
    `OWN_STEPPER_LOG_INTERVAL` to `SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL_MS` to `PATCH_RETRY_LOG_INTERVAL` -- matches
    the name filter. Not one of them is an address; all are tick counts and millisecond periods.
    They stay out of the ledgers for one reason only: they are written in DECIMAL, and the regex
    demands `0x`. Rewrite `const LOG_INTERVAL: usize = 30;` as `0x1e` and it is harvested.
  * Three constants that ARE written in hex are harvested today: `FIRST_SECTION_RVA` (0x1000),
    `GAME_TEXT_RVA_LIMIT` (0x4000000) and `SW_BP_RVA_LIMIT` (0x5000000). Only the first reached a
    ledger, and only because 0x1000 happens to be a `.pdata`-declared function start in both
    builds; the other two sit past `.text`, so `functions.tsv` had no pair to give them. Luck,
    not a rule.

`FIRST_SECTION_RVA` is what a harvested non-address looks like once it lands. It is the PE
section-boundary sanity bound in `er-hook/src/detour_site.rs` (`if table_rva <
FIRST_SECTION_RVA`), it entered `rva-map-1162-to-1170.needed.tsv` as `0x1000 -> 0x1000`, the byte
comparison then scored it `IDENTICAL-WHOLE` / `BOTH-ENTRIES` -- because the bytes at 0x1000 really
are identical across the two builds -- and `er-game-base/build.rs` admitted it to
`DETOUR_SAFE_1162_TO_1170`, the table detour targets are drawn from. Nothing detours it, so it is
inert. It is still a non-address in the address table, and a confident verdict is exactly what a
meaningless row earns.

WHICH DIRECTION THIS IS ALLOWED TO BE WRONG IN
----------------------------------------------
Refusing a real address is the expensive mistake and this repo has made it four times: a
`_BOUND`-suffixed name, an `Enum::Variant as usize` alias, a bare `rva: 0x..` table field, and all
27 of `er-build-import-runtime`'s game calls whose names carry no `RVA` at all. Each miss made the
address invisible end to end -- never selected, never mapped, never verified -- and the running
game refused it while the telemetry reported success. Admitting a non-address, by contrast, adds
an inert row.

So this module NEVER classifies by name and NEVER guesses. It answers one question, with a proof
or not at all:

    Is every use of this constant in `crates/` a COMPARISON, with no use that consumes it as an
    address?

A constant used only as the right-hand side of `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==` or `!=` is a bound, a
threshold or a sentinel. It is not something the workspace resolves or offsets from a module base
-- and resolving or offsetting is the only thing one does with an address. One use this module
cannot classify is enough to withhold the verdict: the answer becomes `None`, the constant stays
in the ledger exactly as before, and nothing breaks. There is no heuristic fallback and no
value threshold; a value test was already measured and rejected upstream, because `>= 0x1000`
admits eleven non-addresses, ten of them exactly `0x1000`.

Run against this tree the proof fires on THREE constants and no others: out of 694 constants whose
name carries `RVA`, 515 that the harvesters can admit, and 477 that already occupy a row in
`rva-map-1162-to-1170.{needed,needed-verified,data}.tsv`.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/rva_role.py             # report every proven non-address in crates/
    python3 scripts/rva_role.py --selftest  # controls: a planted bound, and a real address that
                                            # must NOT be proven

# THE DOCUMENTED EXCLUSION LIST. Every entry here is a constant the harvesters' name filter admits

# THE POPULATION SELECTOR, AND WHY IT IS NOT A DECISION. To ask "is any constant the harvesters
# can admit a non-address?" this has to know which constants they can admit, so it reproduces
# their SHAPE: an `RVA`-substring name, an integer type they recognise, and a hex initialiser
# (`map-data-rvas-1162-to-1170.py` also accepts hex arithmetic, so `0x142658c60 - 0x140000000`
# counts). Nothing downstream is decided by it -- every verdict comes from
# `prove_not_an_address`. It is deliberately a touch WIDER than either harvester: `BOUND`-suffixed
# names are kept in, because a range endpoint is precisely the thing worth proving is a range
# endpoint, and the selftest is happier asking about too many constants than too few.
