"""Fail when two ME3-loadable DLLs detour the same address without a conflict-table entry.

Why this gate exists
--------------------
Two MinHook instances on one prologue overwrite each other's trampolines. The DLL that loses
does not crash, does not log an error, and reports its hook as installed -- it simply never
runs. Every feature behind that detour then looks unimplemented.

That is not hypothetical. Measured 2026-08-23: `er-quickload` and `er-armament-icons` both
detour the Scaleform file-open wrapper at `TITLE_SCALEFORM_FILE_OPEN_RVA` (0x11ced80). In an
eleven-native profile the product DLL reported `file_open_observer_installed = true` and
`file_open_hits = 0` for an entire session; the System>Quit tab rendered vanilla, the title
strip, stats panel and both text-input movies were all silently inert. Loaded alone, the same
build reported 113 hits and derived its movie correctly. The whole day's symptom was a loader
bug wearing a feature bug's clothes.

Why GREPPING for addresses would not have caught it
--------------------------------------------------
Both sides referenced the same named constant (`er_game_base::rva::TITLE_SCALEFORM_FILE_OPEN_RVA`)
rather than a literal, so searching the tree for `0x11ced80` finds only its single definition.
This gate therefore matches on the name as well as on literal addresses.

...AND WHY MATCHING ON THE NAME WAS ONLY HALF THE ANSWER (fixed 2026-08-30)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A NAME IS A SPELLING, AND TWO CRATES DO NOT HAVE TO AGREE ON ONE. Until this date the collision
key WAS the matched token, so two shells claiming one address under two names -- or one under a
name and the other under a bare literal -- keyed differently and never collided. The gate then
printed `2 shared and all declared`, which is a statement about spellings presented as a statement
about addresses.

Measured on this tree the same day: keying on the resolved value instead finds 37 shared addresses
where the name key found 2, and two of them are undeclared pairs the name key could not see:

    0x836f30  er-diag-harness  DLC_ROOTS_JOB_RVA   (installs a detour: `install_one_dlc_roots_hook`)
              er-reload-trace  rva: 0x836f30       (installs a detour: `hook_map_request_do`)
    0x733150  er-armament-icons PROXY_IS_BOUND_RVA (calls it through `icons_fn` + transmute)
              er-reload-trace  rva: 0x733150       (installs a detour: `hook_title_native_ready`)

The first was the exact configuration measured on 2026-08-23 -- two DLLs, two statically linked
MinHook instances, one prologue -- and `scripts/me3-dll-conflicts.toml`'s own `er-diag-harness`
entry asserted of that address that "No other shell in this table names any of the five." It did;
er-reload-trace spells it as a bare `rva:` field in a `HookSpec` table, with no constant name at
all, so nothing keyed on names could ever have contradicted the claim.

Both were closed the same day, and they turned out to be different kinds of finding -- which is why
this paragraph keeps them apart rather than calling both "collisions":

  0x836f30 was a real two-instance collision, and a live one: `~/Elden/group-1170.me3` co-loads
  er_quickload, er_diag_harness, er_reload_trace and er_armament_icons together, so the closure
  generator's `[[conflict]]` ranking never got a vote. er-diag-harness held the private `MhHook`
  and moved to `er_hook::register_shared_hook` with a `UnionFn`-shaped handler (the target takes
  four integer args and returns one, checked against er-hook's "no float/>4-stack-arg" constraint
  before proposing it). One instance now owns the prologue; the pair is a [[shared]] row.

  0x733150 was never a MinHook collision -- er-armament-icons only calls that predicate, and the
  two crates that really detour it (er-quickload and er-reload-trace) were already chained on the
  product's single instance and already declared. The gate reported the wrong pair because an
  alias-shaped `const NAME: usize = <addr>;` is indistinguishable from a hook target by text alone;
  a proximity rule that tried to tell them apart was tested and rejected, because it also stopped
  seeing er-diag-harness's genuine claim on 0x836f30 above. er-reload-trace's observer there was
  removed on its own merits instead (duplicative of an always-on product hook, and it mislabelled
  er-armament-icons' per-tile calls) -- see the comment where that HookSpec row used to be.

So the key is now the resolved value, through `scripts/rva_symbols.py` -- the same resolver
`check-stale-rva-calls.py` and `check-1170-translation-collisions.py` use, which reads enum
discriminants, aliases, `use ... as ...` renames and const arithmetic rather than one regex shape.
A token whose value cannot be resolved keeps its name as the key: an unreadable claim must stay a
claim, because dropping it would turn "I could not resolve this" into "this collides with
nothing", and those are the two answers this whole family of gates exists to keep apart.

What it does
------------
For every cdylib crate (the ME3-loadable shells), collect the hook targets it names: shared RVA
constants from `er_game_base::rva`, bare `0x1xxxxxxx`-shaped literals on lines that look like hook
installation, and bare `rva:` / `address:` / `prologue:` table fields (`HookSpec { rva: 0x836f30,
detour: .. }`), which name an address with no constant at all. Each is resolved to a value. Any
address claimed by two or more cdylibs must appear in `scripts/me3-dll-conflicts.toml`, either
as a `[[conflict]]` pair (they must never share a profile) or as a `[[shared]]` pair (they may,
because both route through one MinHook instance via the hook union), or this fails.

Being listed as a conflict is not a fix -- it is a decision, recorded where the profile generator
can act on it. `[[shared]]` is the fix, and this gate proves it rather than taking its word: each
side names its detour (`handler_a` / `handler_b`), and that symbol must be handed to a union
registrar and must never appear in an `MhHook::new(...)` call. Reverting either side to a private
MinHook instance is then a red gate, not another silent session.

That is how the measured pair above was closed on 2026-08-23: the product's observer moved to
`er_hook::register_union_hook`, and `er-armament-icons` moved to `er_hook::register_shared_hook`,
which resolves the product's `er_effects_union_register` export and chains into its instance
(falling back to its own union when the product is absent). Install order no longer decides it.

    # `CAP_LOAD_JOB_RUN_RVA` -- are one prologue at 0x826d50), so the name key inflates as copies

    #   `PROFILE_LOAD_JOB_RUN_RVA` could resolve to two addresses with one owner each, and the
    #   collision would dissolve with nothing printed. Mutating `resolve_targets` to drift a
    #   name's value per crate fails this case and only this case among the three that follow the
    #   scan. (A name that resolves to nothing is a separate matter, already held by "an
    #   unresolvable name keeps its spelling as the key" on the fixture above; the 25 such tokens
    #   two crates share key on their spelling on both sides here, so they cannot move the
    #   difference either way.)

    #   Nothing short of the value key finds the rest -- the difference is non-empty. Both
    #   addresses in it today (0x836f30, 0x7acb00) are claimed by a named constant in one crate and
    #   a bare `rva:` table field in another, which is the blind spot that cost this project a day
    #   and which the name key cannot close by construction. Blinding the scan to bare `rva:`
    #   fields, or reverting the key to the spelling, empties the difference and fails this.
