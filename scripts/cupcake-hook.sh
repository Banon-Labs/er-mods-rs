# Run a cupcake hook evaluation, surviving harness permission modes cupcake does not know yet.
#
# FOUR BUGS THIS EXISTS TO FIX. The first two were observed live on 2026-08-24 with
# cupcake 0.5.2, the third was measured against the same binary on 2026-08-26, and the
# fourth on 2026-08-31:
#
# 1. NEW PERMISSION MODES ARE FATAL. Claude Code grew an `auto` permission mode; cupcake
#    deserializes `permission_mode` into a closed enum and exits 1 on anything outside
#    {default, plan, acceptEdits, bypassPermissions}:
#
#        Error: unknown variant `auto`, expected one of `default`, `plan`, ...
#
#    That is not a Stop-hook problem, it is EVERY hook -- PreToolUse and PostToolUse included --
#    so every guard in .cupcake/policies went inert for a whole session while the suite stayed
#    green. This repo has been here before (see the check.sh comment about every guard being
#    partly or wholly inert until 2026-08-22), which is exactly why the mode is normalised here
#    rather than waited on: an unrecognised mode must degrade to "evaluate anyway", never to
#    "evaluate nothing".
#
# 2. THE DEFAULT LOG LEVEL IS `info`. Unset, cupcake writes ~60 INFO lines to stderr on every
#    single hook -- policy-by-policy parse chatter, WASM compilation, signal gathering. The
#    user's own global config already passes `--log-level error`; the repo's hooks did not.
#
# 3. THE ENGINE ERASES UNQUOTED NEWLINES, so line 2 of a Bash command has no separator in
#    front of it (bd er-effects-rs-5eah). Measured, not inferred: `cupcake eval` replaces
#    UNQUOTED newlines with spaces before any policy runs, while newlines inside quotes
#    survive. Every git guard anchors command position on `(^|[;&|(\n])`, so
#
#        echo hi
#        git push origin main
#
#    arrived as `echo hi git push origin main` and was ALLOWED in production, while the very
#    same text denies under `opa test`. No pattern in any .rego file can reach this: the
#    separator is gone before evaluation. This script is the last place that sees the raw
#    text, so it restores the boundary here, rewriting each unquoted newline to `; `.
#
#    `;` is the right character on three independent counts: it is in the anchor class of
#    every git guard (`[;&|(\n]`, and `[;&|]\s*|\n` in the fresh-origin-main guard); the
#    Elden Ring launch guard already normalises `\n` to `;` itself before scanning; and the
#    engine measurement above shows `echo hi;<newline>git push origin main` DENYING, so the
#    character demonstrably survives the collapse the newline does not. The trailing space
#    matters too -- commands.has_verb anchors on `(^|\s)verb(\s|$)`, which `;git` would miss.
#
#    WHAT COUNTS AS QUOTED IS NOT THIS SCRIPT'S OWN OPINION. It is the same rule
#    .cupcake/system/commands.rego uses (escaped quotes stripped, split on the quote char,
#    odd indices are quoted, double-quoted-outer tried first and single-quoted-outer as the
#    fallback), transcribed below and mirrored deliberately. A newline inside a quoted span
#    is left alone: a `bd remember` body, a commit message or a doc that merely QUOTES a
#    guarded command must stay allowed, and turning those into `;` would manufacture exactly
#    the false positive bd er-effects-rs-dt2e removed. Where this shim and the policies
#    disagree about what is quoted, one of them is wrong; keeping them the same rule is the
#    point.
#
# 4. `--global-config` WANTS A DIRECTORY, AND THE WRONG SHAPE IS SILENT. This file used to
#    pass `--global-config <repo>/.cupcake/rulebook.yml` -- a FILE. cupcake 0.5.2's own
#    `--help` calls the argument a "global configuration file path", so the shape has to be
#    measured rather than read: the engine rejects anything that is not a directory, and then
#    carries on regardless.
#
#        DEBUG Failed to discover global config: Global config path must be a directory: ...
#        DEBUG No global configuration found - using project config only
#
#    Both lines are DEBUG and this hook runs at `--log-level error` (bug 2), so the degrade
#    was invisible: the hook loaded NO global policies for its whole life while reporting
#    success. Measured on 2026-08-31, same event both ways: with the file path
#    `gh pr ready 999` returned `{}` (allow); with the directory it DENIES. The global set is
#    not inert -- its builtins are all disabled, but ~/.config/cupcake/policies/claude carries
#    two live policies (github_pr_draft_guard, github_attribution_guard) this hook never saw.
#    Nothing was lost in practice only because the user's ~/.claude/settings.json registers a
#    SECOND cupcake hook that does load them; that is a property of this machine, not of this
#    file.
#
#    WHAT THE ENGINE WANTS is the global config ROOT DIRECTORY -- the one holding
#    rulebook.yml, policies/<harness>/ and signals/ -- which it otherwise discovers itself at
#    ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/cupcake. Both branches of that expression were measured
#    against 0.5.2, as were its two rejection modes ("must be a directory", "does not exist").
#    In BOTH rejection modes it goes project-only and does NOT fall back to discovery, so a
#    bad override loads strictly less than no override -- which is why the failure path below
#    drops the override instead of forwarding it.
#
#    FAIL LOUD, NOT CLOSED. The precondition is checked here, before the engine runs, and a
#    failure is announced twice: a banner on stderr, and a `systemMessage` merged into the
#    hook's JSON stdout, which Claude Code shows to the user on every hook it fires. It
#    deliberately does NOT block. This hook sits in front of EVERY tool call, so exiting
#    non-zero on a bad config path would stop all work including the work needed to repair it;
#    and since cupcake signals a deny through stdout JSON at exit 0, changing the exit code
#    risks the harness discarding a real deny verdict -- the same fail-open as bug 1. Shouting
#    on every call is the point, and it stops the moment the path is right.
#
#    RESIDUE, stated rather than hidden: this checks the two structural preconditions that
#    make loading POSSIBLE -- the root is a directory, and the harness policy directory exists
#    under it -- not that any policy actually compiled. cupcake reports that only at
#    INFO/DEBUG, which bug 2 suppresses on purpose. A global root whose policies/claude is
#    present but empty still contributes nothing and still reports success here.
#
# stdout, stdin and the exit code are passed through untouched: the exit code is how cupcake
# denies an action, so swallowing it would disable the guards just as thoroughly as bug 1.

        `git commit -F - <<'EOF'` -- is DATA, and is treated exactly like a quoted span:
        its newlines are left as newlines. This repo's agents write those constantly, and

        It is also what keeps this shim from breaking the policies' own heredoc handling:
