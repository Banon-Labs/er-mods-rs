"""A log describes exactly ONE process run. This makes that executable.

Standing rule (2026-08-04): no product DLL, shell or harness in this repo may append to a log
across runs. Each log file is truncated by the first write of the process that owns it; keeping
an older run means copying the file aside yourself, not letting it accumulate.

The failure that set the rule: `crates/er-invasion-warp/src/lib.rs` opened its log with a
plain `OpenOptions::new().append(true)` on a fixed name next to the game executable. Twelve
separate launches piled into one 565 KB file, so a count taken over it ("37 confirms") read as
ONE run doing something 37 times when it was really twelve runs, and per-run state could only be
recovered by hand-splitting on the module-base banner. Worse, lines from builds that no longer
exist sat indistinguishably next to lines from the build under test.

A comment saying "don't append" is not enforcement -- this repo has been bitten by exactly that
(see `check-me3-shell-coverage.py`, which exists because an array was kept correct by a comment).
So the shape is pinned instead:

  * `er_game_base::log::begin_fresh_run(path)` is the one-shot. The FIRST call for a path in a
    process rotates the previous run's file aside (`<name>.prev`, exactly one generation) and
    truncates. Every later call is a no-op, so a run never loses its own earlier lines.
  * `er_game_base::log::open_fresh_run_append(path)` runs that one-shot and hands back an
    appending handle. It is the ONLY sanctioned appending opener.
  * Therefore: an `OpenOptions`-style `.append(...)` may appear ONLY in the helper module, or in
    a file listed in EXEMPT with a stated reason.

`Vec::append` / `String::append` take `&mut ...`, so an argument starting with `&` is not a file
opener and is not flagged. `File::create` / `truncate(true)` are already fresh and are ignored.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check-fresh-run-logs.py
    python3 scripts/check-fresh-run-logs.py --selftest

Exit status is 1 on any failure, so this can gate.
