"""Forbid env-var feature gates in the DLL source; permit only justified diagnostic reads.

POLICY (deprecate-env-marker-gate-allowlists-no-gated-features-2026-07-19)
=========================================================================
User directive: "we don't want any env gated features." An "env gate" is any read of
`std::env::var("ER_QUICKLOAD_...")` in `crates/er-quickload/src/**/*.rs`. The former
grandfathering allowlists (`sanctioned_env_vars`, `sanctioned_env_gate_locations`,
`baseline`) are DEPRECATED: they are kept in the baseline JSON only so their emptiness
is explicit, and this checker FAILS if any of them is non-empty. With the behavioral
allowlist empty, EVERY env gate hard-fails UNLESS its exact stable key
(`ENV_VAR@repo/path.rs`) appears in `diagnostic_gates` (in
`.auto/env_gate_comment_baseline.json`) with a non-empty rationale.

`diagnostic_gates` is the ONLY permitted exception and is reserved for genuinely
diagnostic reads that change NO game behavior -- passive logging/telemetry/trace,
read-only sampling, or a pure diagnostic OUTPUT-PATH / tuning override (e.g.
`ER_QUICKLOAD_INPUT_TRACE`, `ER_QUICKLOAD_PROFILE`, `ER_QUICKLOAD_*_PATH`). A behavioral
feature must be DEFAULT behavior (gated only on a real runtime condition) or removed;
it may never be re-added as an env gate. Adding a `diagnostic_gates` entry is a
deliberate reviewed act that shows in the diff and must carry a justification.

The declarative policy lives at `.auto/env_gate_comment_policy.rego`; this checker
asserts that file exists and contains its required snippets so it cannot silently drift.

READS ONLY REAL CODE (2026-08-30)
=================================
Every fact below is derived from source text with comments and string bodies blanked by
the shared `code_only` reader, never from raw text. Before this the gate matched prose:
a `//` line quoting `std::env::var("ER_QUICKLOAD_X")` was a finding, and a `fn` inside a
block comment could be reported as the enclosing function. The required-`.rego`-snippet
facts were the same defect pointing the other way -- a REQUIRE satisfied by a comment,
which is silent forever -- so they are now split into STRUCTURAL snippets that must be
real Rego logic and DOCUMENTARY snippets that are prose by design. See `selftest`.
