"""Tests for scripts/check-dll-byte-identical.py and scripts/me3-dll-list.py.

The comparator is only useful if it draws the line in exactly the right place:
blind to link-time noise, and unable to miss a single changed code byte. Both
halves are asserted here against a REAL cdylib from `target/`, because a
synthetic PE would not exercise the debug-directory/CodeView walk that the
normalizer depends on.

The BUILD WATERMARK is the third thing tested, and it is the one that had the
gate red on every PR: er-game-base's build.rs bakes a 12-character commit id
into every DLL that links it, so two different commits always differ by those
bytes. Masking it is only safe if the mask cannot grow into an exemption, so the
cases here are paired -- the watermark alone must FAIL unmasked and PASS masked,
a sha present in neither image must mask nothing and hide nothing, and a flipped
.text byte must still fail with the mask correctly applied.

Skips (exit 0) when no built DLL is available -- same convention as the
corpus-dependent tests in crates/er-gfx.
